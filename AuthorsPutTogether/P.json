{"P. C. Cast":["Vampires and teens have a lot in common. Teens have surging hormones, vampires have surging blood lust. Teenagers think they're immortal.","If you're too scared to put your dreams, thoughts, desires, fantasies on paper and share them with the world, then being an author isn't the right career for you.","As a successful romantic novelist - one of my publishers is Mills & Boon - I create the sort of male heroes that no woman could fail to adore and few real men could hope to emulate.","I'm from a family of teachers. My father would drown me in the bathtub if my daughter didn't graduate from college. I don't care who she is or what she does. Just get the diploma.","Kids definitely go into bookstores after reading 'Twilight' and want something else like it.","I've seen a big shift, especially in my classroom, with women standing up and demanding respect. That's in every woman, whether 16, 26, 56.","Vampires are super sexy.","I don't write women who are weak or simpering.","I love to walk into Borders or Barnes & Noble and see my books there. It's fabulous.","With a young-adult series, you need to get a lot of books out on the market quickly. Teenagers aren't going to wait years and years for the next book."],"P. Chidambaram":["The voter does not vote only on one issue, the voter votes on a multiplicity of issues.","It is possible that, post-Kyoto, the developed countries will recognise the requirements of the developing world.","Evidence points out that if you raise tariffs too much it will increase smuggling.","I think people respect governments that take decisions and act decisively.","We cannot afford to leave the poor behind.","'Big business' was a bad phrase in India. To be accused of being big business was the worst accusation you could make. All that has gone now. The whole mindset has changed.","People are wiser than we are willing to attribute to them.","Police can only act on intelligence.","A government can do only what is feasible given the political and economic context.","Independence is a very subjective assessment.","I don't think we should label budgets even before the budget is presented.","I respect the view of a rating agency, but I do not make a budget for the rating agency. I make a budget for the people of India.","Growth is a panacea for many ills in society; not entirely, but many.","In income tax, there is no case for amnesty.","I have maintained that the people of India are ahead of their governments. The people of India are at least 10 to 15 years ahead of their governments.","If you go back to any period in India's history, all the hard decisions this country had to take were taken when the Congress was in power.","Today, to allege corruption seems to be the pastime of most people. All kinds of allegations are leveled. I think it is self-defeating.","All wisdom does not reside in Delhi.","Two successive commissioners in London police were fired by the mayor that came into office. That doesn't mean the police in London is not independent and does not exercise powers. Ultimately it is the political executive that has to answer.","The police force cannot be completely independent of the executive government.","Let me tell you, very frankly, when I went to the Harvard Business School I was more or less a committed socialist.","When I came back to India after Harvard Business School, I started as a lawyer and as a trade union leader.","People understand what is good for them in the long run. In the long run, what is good for people is that India's economy continues to grow at clipping pace, 8% and above, that itself brings host of benefits to the people. It brings better roads, it brings better schools, brings more money to the communities, it brings more jobs.","Criticism of a policy is welcome. But in the garb of criticizing a policy, if you allege that the policy was made for corrupt purposes, I reject it."],"P. D. James":["God gives every bird his worm, but He does not throw it into the nest.","What the detective story is about is not murder but the restoration of order.","I believe that political correctness can be a form of linguistic fascism, and it sends shivers down the spine of my generation who went to war against fascism.","Human kindness is like a defective tap, the first gush may be impressive but the stream soon dries up.","It was one of those perfect English autumnal days which occur more frequently in memory than in life.","What a child doesn't receive he can seldom later give.","In 1930s mysteries, all sorts of motives were credible which aren't credible today, especially motives of preventing guilty sexual secrets from coming out. Nowadays, people sell their guilty sexual secrets.","There comes a time when every scientist, even God, has to write off an experiment.","We English are good at forgiving our enemies; it releases us from the obligation of liking our friends."],"P. F. Strawson":["No philosopher understands his predecessors until he has re-thought their thought in his own contemporary terms.","Neither Aristotelian nor Russellian rules give the exact logic of any expression of ordinary language; for ordinary language has no exact logic."],"P.

It was invented by a Frenchman. It is called the guillotine.","I could see that, if not actually disgruntled, he was far from being gruntled.","Why don't you get a haircut? You look like a chrysanthemum.","Memories are like mulligatawny soup in a cheap restaurant. It is best not to stir them.","It is a good rule in life never to apologize. The right sort of people do not want apologies, and the wrong sort take a mean advantage of them.","Her pupils were at once her salvation and her despair. They gave her the means of supporting life, but they made life hardly worth supporting.","He was white and shaken, like a dry martini.","She had a penetrating sort of laugh. Rather like a train going into a tunnel.","Golf... is the infallible test. The man who can go into a patch of rough alone, with the knowledge that only God is watching him, and play his ball where it lies, is the man who will serve you faithfully and well.","Few of them were to be trusted within reach of a trowel and a pile of bricks.","Has anybody ever seen a dramatic critic in the daytime? Of course not. They come out after dark, up to no good.","Sudden success in golf is like the sudden acquisition of wealth. It is apt to unsettle and deteriorate the character.","He was a tubby little chap who looked as if he had been poured into his clothes and had forgotten to say 'when!'","I just sit at a typewriter and curse a bit.","Every author really wants to have letters printed in the papers. Unable to make the grade, he drops down a rung of the ladder and writes novels.","The least thing upset him on the links. He missed short putts because of the uproar of the butterflies in the adjoining meadows.","Success comes to a writer as a rule, so gradually that it is always something of a shock to him to look back and realize the heights to which he has climbed.","Golf, like measles, should be caught young.","I know I was writing stories when I was five. I don't know what I did before that. Just loafed I suppose.","It was my Uncle George who discovered that alcohol was a food well in advance of modern medical thought."],"P. J. Harvey":["I've always felt that I'm affected by the world, by the way we treat each other, by the way different countries treat each other.","I did photography, painting, and drawing, but I prefer sculpture. I like it because it's very physical.","I decide immediately if I like a person and if I do, then I'm myself, and if I don't, then I give nothing.","I firmly disbelieve that one has to be a tortured soul to write good music.","My mom is a sculptress.","I tried to use words that were dealing with the emotional quality that any human being could recognize in the way that they felt about their country. It's to do with the world we live in. That world is a brutal one and full of war. It's also full of many wonderful things and love and hope.","People like Howlin' Wolf, Bob Dylan, The Rolling Stones, John Lee Hooker, Nina Simone, Captain Beefheart - all of these artists were what I grew up listening to every day of my life. And there's a very healthy music scene in the west country of England, where I grew up.","I'm a Libra. That means that I can make a decision, but only after much thought.","I'm not an autobiographical writer, but I am a writer who deals with human emotion on all levels.","I don't loathe interviews, I'm just one of those people who makes music because I find it difficult to talk.","There is nothing more boring than doing singing exercises.","People have a tendency to see country life through rose-colored glasses.","Making me into a role model is placing too much importance on what I see as a work in progress.","I work on words quite separately to music. They're both ongoing, and I don't ever feel like I'm working in a cycle in that respect, because it's every day anyway, no matter what I'm doing. Then I get to a point when I've collected together enough words that seem like they want to be songs rather than poems, or sometimes not.","I work on words, mostly, toward them being poetry or short stories, and then some of those become songs. They all find their place in the world, but they all start off in the same place. I'm always painting and drawing as well, and it's an ongoing creative assignment.","I'm not a writer where I feel particularly blessed by great inspiration every day. I don't. I have to work really hard at it to try and say the things I'm concerned with.","There's so much you can do with laying words on a bed of music. You can completely change their meaning with the type of music or the way they're sung.","It's so much in me to want to keep experimenting all the time. It's just inherent. Therefore I keep reaching for instruments I don't particularly know how to play, and then I become excited.","I don't think that much anymore in terms of 'write a record, record a record, tour a record,' because in my own mind, things have changed, in that I'm just an ongoing artist. I'm not quite sure what the next project needs to be until it presents himself, and then I know. I just follow dutifully while I'm being led.","In order to make my solo shows as interesting as possible, I moved songs onto very different instruments so that I was moving instruments quite a lot during the set.","My mother and father are very involved with music. It's completely part of their soul. They have an incredible record collection, all vinyl, of some of the best artists, in my eyes, that you can come across.","I was a visual artist primarily and a writer, even from a very young age.","I'd want to read the stories that I'd written, I'd want to show the drawings that I made. That was just purely natural. So I knew I wanted to go into the arts in some way and that I'd want to show that work in some way.","I literally left school and went straight into music via art college for a year, and I've been so involved in my job of writing songs that the more actively involved part became channeled into standing on the stage and saying things that way.","I'm probably much more influenced by film-makers and painters than I am by other songwriters or poets.","With songs I almost see the images, see the action, and then all I have to do is describe it. It's almost like watching a scene from a film, and that's what I go about trying to catch in a song.","I've always been very visceral in that I feel things very deeply.","There's also a level of discipline I use as a writer, designed to get better at what I'm doing, that requires quite a lot of study and quite a lot of hard work as well.","I didn't know folk music growing up, no. It's something I've come to study, really, because I think there's so much to learn from traditional music in the sense of the way music began as a way of communication, the traveling storyteller, the bard, the minstrels.","As I grew older, I actually was prepared to go into fine arts school and do a degree. That was what I was actually settled upon when I was offered a record deal.","My father is actually a quarry man - he deals in stone. He also at one point had a lot of sheep, he owned a sheep farm, but primarily the family business was in stone.","I'm a very private person, so obviously I don't enjoy talking about more personal matters.","Maybe I'm just purely lucky. If I've come up against obstacles I've always found another way around it.","Well, I don't really concern myself too much with what other people make of my work.","I think that's always very valuable: to keep the mind open to receiving all sorts of information, which can then be used in my work, but also just as a human being.","I come from an art-school background, and I still feel that in my music, it's about exploration and challenging myself, about putting myself in a place that's frightening because I haven't been there before.","I think I'm a songwriter. I grab an instrument to make my body a song, but I'm not a player as such, maybe a little more on guitar, but certainly not piano."],"P. J. O'Rourke":["Anyway, no drug, not even alcohol, causes the fundamental ills of society. If we're looking for the source of our troubles, we shouldn't test people for drugs, we should test them for stupidity, ignorance, greed and love of power.","Supposedly, summer vacation happens because that's when the kids are home from school, although having the kids home from school is no vacation. And supposedly the kids are home from school because of some vestigial throwback to our agricultural past.","The Democrats are the party that says government will make you smarter, taller, richer, and remove the crabgrass on your lawn. The Republicans are the party that says government doesn't work and then they get elected and prove it.","Giving money and power to government is like giving whiskey and car keys to teenage boys.","The 20th century was a test bed for big ideas - fascism, communism, the atomic bomb.","Each child is biologically required to have a mother. Fatherhood is a well-regarded theory, but motherhood is a fact.","Everybody knows how to raise children, except the people who have them.","Liberals have invented whole college majors - psychology, sociology and women's studies - to prove that nothing is anybody's fault.","Because of their size, parents may be difficult to discipline properly.","Cleanliness becomes more important when godliness is unlikely.","The U.S. tax code was written by A students. Every April 15, we have to pay somebody who got an A in accounting to keep ourselves from being sent to jail.","In its worse forms, conservatism is a matter of 'I hate strangers and anything that's different.'","As a longtime former resident of 15 years in Washington, I wish that everybody would stay off the Mall with their political cause so that we can get out there, you know, and play flag football or Frisbee, or walk the dog or something - you know, which is, you know, what the National Mall should be for, in my personal opinion.","Everybody is xenophobic to an extent.","All previous populist movements were demanding things from governments, whereas the Tea Party is saying, 'Give us less, go away.' That's heartening to see.","Globalization is simply opening the free marketplace to encompass the entire world.","The foundation of collectivism is simple: There should be no important economic differences among people. No one should be too rich.","Harvard is the home of American ideas.","The Clinton administration launched an attack on people in Texas because those people were religious nuts with guns. Hell, this country was founded by religious nuts with guns. Who does Bill Clinton think stepped ashore on Plymouth Rock?","Never wear anything that panics the cat.","By the end of the 1950s, American cars were so reliable that their reliability went without saying even in car ads. Thousands of them bear testimony to this today, still running on the roads of Cuba though fueled with nationalized Venezuelan gasoline and maintained with spit and haywire.","Modern elites live in bubbles of liberal affluence like Ann Arbor, Brookline, the Upper West Side, Palo Alto, or Chevy Chase. These places used to have impoverished neighborhoods nearby, but the poor people got chased out by young singles living in group homes, hipsters, and urban homesteading gay couples.","There is a simple rule here, a rule of legislation, a rule of business, a rule of life: beyond a certain point, complexity is fraud. You can apply that rule to left-wing social programs, but you can also apply that rule to credit derivatives, hedge funds, all the rest of it.","Staying married may have long-term benefits. You can elicit much more sympathy from friends over a bad marriage than you ever can from a good divorce.","The world is being run by irresponsible spoiled brats.","When I board an airplane these days, all the middle-aged men are dressed like me - when I was an 8-year-old. They're in shorts and T-shirts. And it's not just on airplanes. It's in business offices, teachers' lounges, and churches.","Arguing, in the sense of attempting to convince others, has gone out of fashion with conservatives.","We have the British motor industry as a role model for what happens when you try to save an industrial dinosaur. Britain was the first country to industrialise and the first to de-industrialise. We should learn from this.","I'm too tough and sensitive to have to have some pubescent twerp with his mom's earring in his tongue, who combs his hair with Redi-Whip and has an Ani DiFranco tattoo on his shin, come show me how a computer works.","As a former writer for the 'National Lampoon,' I've probably contributed to the sea of sarcasm in which we live.","The Tea Party has definitely increased political involvement, not only among Tea Party members but among people who oppose the Tea Party members. It's been a general stimulus.","Disney's House of the Future had the clean simplicity prized in the 1950s as relief from decades of frayed patchwork, jury-rigging, and make-do clutter caused by Depression and war.","Affirmative action makes employers think, 'Black woman nuclear physicist? Hah! Probably let her into Harvard 'cause they were looking for a twofer. Bet she got C's in high school practical math. Give her a job in personnel.'","There is no virtue in compulsory government charity, and there is no virtue in advocating it. A politician who portrays himself as 'caring' and 'sensitive' because he wants to expand the government's charitable programs is merely saying that he's willing to try to do good with other people's money.","I've only been to New Zealand once, about 1989. It was incredibly beautiful, kind of like the ideal of where I live in New England - all that and then some - but I can't say I was there long enough to get any very clear idea.","The mystery of government is not how Washington works but how to make it stop.","If government were a product, selling it would be illegal.","There is only one basic human right, the right to do as you damn well please. And with it comes the only basic human duty, the duty to take the consequences.","Hubris is one of the great renewable resources.","There are a number of mechanical devices which increase sexual arousal, particularly in women. Chief among these is the Mercedes-Benz 380SL convertible.","The whole idea of our government is this: If enough people get together and act in concert, they can take something and not pay for it.","The great majority of Baghdad is a slum - a lot of it's new, but it's still slum. It's usually this concrete-block, one-room design with a door and a window, arranged one-up, one-down, often with a shop with nothing in it on the first floor, and then a one-room apartment above it. There's street after street after street of that stuff.","Wealth is not a pizza, where if I have too many slices you have to eat the Domino's box.","The minute somebody joins a committee... they immediately suffer from committee brain. They become wildly over-enthusiastic, over-optimistic, over-pessimistic. Committees turn people into idiots, and politics is a committee.","Inside every Sancho Panza there's a Don Quixote struggling to get out.","Every vote should carry a serial number, so that responsibility for harmful or careless use of the vote can be traced. Concealed voting should be outlawed.","Fascism is very much a mob movement.","I am unboreable in the great outdoors.","There's one more terrifying fact about old people: I'm going to be one soon.","In Israel, waves of anger and fear circulate all the time, but so do jokes and gossip and silky evening breezes. So, too, in America.","It could be that all awful dictators are frustrated artists - Mao with his poetry and Mussolini with his monuments. Stalin was once a journalistic hack, and I can personally testify to how frustrated they are. Pol Pot left a very edgy photo collection behind. And Osama seems quite interested in video.","In Henry Adams, I discovered not only the prototype of the modern thinker but also someone who is more interesting: a viper-toothed, puling, supercilious crank, thwarted in ambition, aging gracelessly, mad at the cosmos, and ashamed of his own jejune ideals. He is nevertheless very dear to me.","Crazy old people are our entire source of polling information.","In our brief national history we have shot four of our presidents, worried five of them to death, impeached one and hounded another out of office. And when all else fails, we hold an election and assassinate their character.","Most people sort of enjoy going to work because of the socialisation, a chance to flirt with co-workers and so on, but actually hate the job they do.","People will tell you anything but what they do is always the truth.","I read good. I was an English major.","Don't send funny greeting cards on birthdays or at Christmas. Save them for funerals, when their cheery effect is needed.","Term limits aren't enough. We need jail.","Always read something that will make you look good if you die in the middle of it.","You can learn all about the human condition from covering the crime beat in a big city - you don't need to go to Beirut for that - but a foreign correspondent begins to understand poverty from a different perspective.","Children live in the only successful Marxist state ever created: the family. 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his need' is the family's practice as well as its theory. Even with today's scattershot patterns of marriage and parenting, a family is collectivist to a more than North Korean degree.","Politicians are wonderful people as long as they stay away from things they don't understand, such as working for a living.","New Hampshire polling data are unreliable because, when you call the Granite State's registered Republicans and independents in the middle of dinner and ask them who they're going to vote for, they have a mouth full of mashed potatoes and you can't understand what they say.","Never be unfaithful to a lover, except with your wife.","Simply because something is a populist movement doesn't make it either good or bad.","The library, with its Daedalian labyrinth, mysterious hush, and faintly ominous aroma of knowledge, has been replaced by the computer's cheap glow, pesky chirp, and data spillage.","Political systems are run by self-selecting politicians. We don't draft people; it's not jury duty.","Abstract anger is great for rhetorical carrying on. You can go on endlessly about the post office, but it doesn't mean you're mad at your mailman.","To mistrust science and deny the validity of scientific method is to resign your job as a human. You'd better go look for work as a plant or wild animal.","Once you've built the big machinery of political power, remember you won't always be the one to run it.","Why do elites hate the poor? It's xenophobia. They don't know any poor people - except their off-the-books Brazilian nanny and illegal immigrant cleaning lady from Upper Revolta who don't speak English.","Woodstock had a tremendous impact on American artistic life.","Global warming is a fact. Now it's up to liberals to make it a reality. Hence there is crucial importance in preventing powerful, greedy free market forces from getting in the way of worsening storms and rising sea levels. The Kyoto Accord is a good first step.","In thirteen years, every aspect of the universe can change - ask a thirteen-year-old.","Governments have monopolies on certain things, like eminent domain and deadly force.","The idea of a news broadcast once was to find someone with information and broadcast it. The idea now is to find someone with ignorance and spread it around.","The young are adept at learning, but even more adept at avoiding it.","They are just really stupid people in Hollywood. You write them a script, and they say they love it, they absolutely love it. Then they say, 'But doesn't it need a small dog, and an Eskimo, and shouldn't it be set in New Guinea?' And you say, 'But it is a sophisticated romantic comedy set in Paris.'","People are not ants or bees. We do not reason or love or live or die collectively.","You can't get rid of poverty by giving people money.","Seriousness is stupidity sent to college.","The great thing about being a print journalist is that you are permitted to duck. Cameramen get killed while the writers are flat on the floor. A war correspondent for the BBC dedicated his memoir to 50 fallen colleagues, and I guarantee you they were all taking pictures. I am only alive because I am such a chicken.","Little islands of human happiness, peace, and prosperity are so exceptional at this point in history that I'm not even sure we can draw lessons from them.","Positive rights are the right to shelter, the right to education, the right to health care, the right to a living wage. These things are - these are, I would call them, more properly, political rights rather than positive rights. And they are extremely tricky, because now we are dealing with things that are zero sum.","I've got a 1990 Porsche 911. It's just a Carrera, a very simple, straightforward little thing that goes like stink. I love it.","The most brilliant satire of all time was 'A Modest Proposal' by Jonathan Swift. You'll notice how everything got straightened out in Ireland within days of that coming out.","I grew up going to public school, and they were huge public schools. I went to a school that had 3,200 kids, and I had grade school classes with 40-some kids. Discipline was rigid. Most of the learning was rote. It worked.","Gay marriage acceptance is happening in the blink of an eye.","Political leaders are expert at saying nothing.","I blame feminism and Facebook for the death of the American automobile. I'm a Republican, so I blame everything on feminism - or commies.","The car provided Americans with an enviable standard of living. You could not get a steady job with high wages and health and retirement benefits working on the General Livestock Corporation assembly line putting udders on cows.","More modern poetry is written than read.","The C student starts a restaurant. The A student writes restaurant reviews.","The 18,000 NASA employees are full of galactic talents and abilities and are ready to accomplish whatever they're directed to do.","Popular culture has become engorged, broadening and thickening until it's the only culture anyone notices.","Some taxpayers may object to a print journalism bailout on the grounds that it mostly benefits the liberal elite. And we can't blame taxpayers for being reluctant to subsidize the reportorial careers of J-school twerps who should have joined the Peace Corps and gone to Africa to 'speak truth to power' to Robert Mugabe.","President Bush said that if illegal immigrants want citizenship, they'd have to do three things: pay taxes, hold meaningful jobs, and learn English. Bush doesn't meet those qualifications.","Bill Clinton is not a hypocrite. If a man believes that it is just and moral to redistribute wealth, there is nothing hypocritical in his attempts to redistribute some of that wealth to himself.","The problem, when comparing contemporary television to television in 1974, is that TV has become not just bad but sad.","Making fun of born-again Christians is like hunting dairy cows with a high powered rifle and scope.","There is no 20-year period in American history when stocks lost money.","Government proposes, bureaucracy disposes. And the bureaucracy must dispose of government proposals by dumping them on us.","It's better to make fun of yourself because you've always got someone around to make fun of, and they can't sue you."],"P. J. Soles":["I went to Briar Cliff College initially, and then I transferred to Georgetown University, because I was a Russian major, and I was one of two girls accepted that year. This was September 1969 - well, that would have been 1970 - into the School Of Languages And Linguistics in Georgetown.","I am so happy that every generation still tunes into most of the classic and cult films I was lucky to be a part of.","Horror movies are all about getting your attention; you always have to be on guard. People love to be on the edge - there's nothing like a surprise.","Japan has really great fans for all kinds of music. I think they're keeping metal alive.","'Carrie' was a pretty big-budget movie at a real studio, with a director that had already done a bunch of things and had some notoriety, and Stephen King was the writer.","I've always written poetry and lyrics. My first husband, who was a musician, we wrote a bunch of songs together."],"P. L. Travers":["Sorrow lies like a heartbeat behind everything I have written.","Nothing I had written before 'Mary Poppins' had anything to do with children, and I have always assumed, when I thought about it at all, that she had come out of the same wall of nothingness as the poetry, myth and legend that had absorbed me all my writing life.","I cannot summon up inspiration; I myself am summoned.","You do not chop off a section of your imaginative substance and make a book specifically for children, for - if you are honest - you have no idea where childhood ends and maturity begins. It is all endless and all one.","A writer is, after all, only half his book. The other half is the reader and from the reader the writer learns.","You can ask me anything you like about my work, but I'll never talk about myself.","'Friend Monkey' is really my favorite of all my books because the Hindu myth on which it is based is my favorite - the myth of the Monkey Lord who loved so much that he created chaos wherever he went.","I think that 'Mary Poppins' needs a subtle reader, in many respects, to grasp all its implications, and I understand that these cannot be translated in terms of the film.","For me, there are no answers, only questions, and I am grateful that the questions go on and on. I don't look for an answer because I don't think there is one. I'm very glad to be the bearer of a question.","Every child needs to have for itself not only its loving parents and siblings and friends of its own age, but a grown-up friend.","I never wrote my books especially for children.","My family didn't like me going on the stage, and they didn't much like my being a writer, either.","I was brought up Irish, where there was room for my own private world.","My father died when I was 7. I was his favorite child, and he was my beloved father. I brought him along with me all through my life. Every elderly man has a bit of my father in him for me.","I've had quite a lot to conquer in myself apart from writing. Not that I've been a pure angel when I come to the end of it.","I think the idea of 'Mary Poppins' has been blowing in and out of me, like a curtain at a window, all my life."],"P. N. Elrod":["Fame and fortune are as hard to find as a lightning strike.","I have no discipline, which is a horrible flaw for any writer. Once I'm well started on a project, though, then I'm addicted to it all day long. When it's done, I collapse and have to really kick myself to start a new one.","Real people - the interesting ones, anyway - don't remain static, and neither do the ones I write about. Changes take place, and they react to them.","I'll have to self-publish it because unless you're on the 'New York Times' bestseller lists, anthologies don't sell all that well. However, low sales to a big publisher are a major success to a small one!"],"P. Sathasivam":["There are checks and balances and broad separation of powers under the Constitution. Each organ of the State, i.e. the legislature, the executive and the judiciary, must have respect for the others and not encroach into each other's domain.","As a practising lawyer, I was mediocre, but I worked hard as a law officer of the state government and on the private side. After becoming a judge, I maintained a low profile in other activities and concentrated only on judicial work."],"P. T. Barnum":["To me there is no picture so beautiful as smiling, bright-eyed, happy children; no music so sweet as their clear and ringing laughter.","The foundation of success in life is good health: that is the substratum fortune; it is also the basis of happiness. A person cannot accumulate a fortune very well when he is sick.","A lovely nook of forest scenery, or a grand rock, like a beautiful woman, depends for much of its attractiveness upon the attendance sense of freedom from whatever is low; upon a sense of purity and of romance.","Whatever you do, do it with all your might. Work at it, early and late, in season and out of season, not leaving a stone unturned, and never deferring for a single hour that which can be done just as well now.","Every man should make his son or daughter learn some useful trade or profession, so that in these days of changing fortunes of being rich today and poor tomorrow they may have something tangible to fall back upon. This provision might save many persons from misery, who by some unexpected turn of fortune have lost all their means.","Literature is one of the most interesting and significant expressions of humanity.","Fortune always favors the brave, and never helps a man who does not help himself.","Without promotion, something terrible happens... nothing!","True economy consists in always making the income exceed the out-go. Wear the old clothes a little longer if necessary; dispense with the new pair of gloves; mend the old dress: live on plainer food if need be; so that, under all circumstances, unless some unforeseen accident occurs, there will be a margin in favor of the income.","There is no such thing in the world as luck. There never was a man who could go out in the morning and find a purse full of gold in the street to-day, and another to-morrow, and so on, day after day: He may do so once in his life; but so far as mere luck is concerned, he is as liable to lose it as to find it.","Every crowd has a silver lining.","The show business has all phases and grades of dignity, from the exhibition of a monkey to the exposition of that highest art in music or the drama which secures for the gifted artists a world-wide fame princes well might envy.","No man has a right to expect to succeed in life unless he understands his business, and nobody can understand his business thoroughly unless he learns it by personal application and experience.","Politeness and civility are the best capital ever invested in business. Large stores, gilt signs, flaming advertisements, will all prove unavailing if you or your employees treat your patrons abruptly. The truth is, the more kind and liberal a man is, the more generous will be the patronage bestowed upon him.","He who is without a newspaper is cut off from his species.","Clowns are the pegs on which the circus is hung.","Money is in some respects life's fire: it is a very excellent servant, but a terrible master.","Unless a man enters upon the vocation intended for him by nature, and best suited to his peculiar genius, he cannot succeed. I am glad to believe that the majority of persons do find their right vocation.","In the United States, where we have more land than people, it is not at all difficult for persons in good health to make money.","There is scarcely anything that drags a person down like debt.","Men, women, and children who cannot live on gravity alone need something to satisfy their gayer, lighter moods and hours, and he who ministers to this want is, in my opinion, in a business established by the Creator of our nature. If he worthily fulfills his mission and amuses without corrupting, he need never feel that he has lived in vain.","As a general thing, I have not 'duped the world' nor attempted to do so... I have generally given people the worth of their money twice told.","Science is the pursuit of pure truth, and the systematizing of it.","Politics and government are certainly among the most important of practical human interests.","Medicine is the means by which we poor feeble creatures try to keep from dying or aching.","Witchcraft is one of the most baseless, absurd, disgusting and silly of all the humbugs."],"Paavo Nurmi":["Mind is everything. Muscle - pieces of rubber. All that I am, I am because of my mind.","All that I am, I am because of my mind."],"Pablo Casals":["The love of one's country is a splendid thing. But why should love stop at the border?","Each person has inside a basic decency and goodness. If he listens to it and acts on it, he is giving a great deal of what it is the world needs most. It is not complicated but it takes courage. It takes courage for a person to listen to his own goodness and act on it.","Music is the divine way to tell beautiful, poetic things to the heart.","I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance.","The child must know that he is a miracle, that since the beginning of the world there hasn't been, and until the end of the world there will not be, another child like him.","We ought to think that we are one of the leaves of a tree, and the tree is all humanity. We cannot live without the others, without the tree.","You must work - we must all work to make the world worthy of its children.","Music will save the world.","Man has made many machines, complex and cunning, but which of them indeed rivals the workings of his heart?","The heart of the melody can never be put down on paper.","I am perhaps the oldest musician in the world. I am an old man but in many senses a very young man. And this is what I want you to be, young, young all your life, and to say things to the world that are true.","The first thing to do in life is to do with purpose what one purposes to do.","Let us not forget that the greatest composers were also the greatest thieves. They stole from everyone and everywhere.","To retire is to die.","To retire is to begin to die.","The art of interpretation is not to play what is written.","The most perfect technique is that which is not noticed at all."],"Pablo Neruda":["I want to do to you what spring does with the cherry trees.","You can cut all the flowers but you cannot keep spring from coming.","The books that help you most are those which make you think that most. The hardest way of learning is that of easy reading; but a great book that comes from a great thinker is a ship of thought, deep freighted with truth and beauty.","And one by one the nights between our separated cities are joined to the night that unites us.","I grew up in this town, my poetry was born between the hill and the river, it took its voice from the rain, and like the timber, it steeped itself in the forests.","Love is so short, forgetting is so long.","Peace goes into the making of a poem as flour goes into the making of bread.","A child who does not play is not a child, but the man who doesn't play has lost forever the child who lived in him and who he will miss terribly.","But from each crime are born bullets that will one day seek out in you where the heart lies."],"Pablo Picasso":["The purpose of art is washing the dust of daily life off our souls.","All children are artists. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.","Who sees the human face correctly: the photographer, the mirror, or the painter?","It takes a long time to become young.","Youth has no age.","Some painters transform the sun into a yellow spot, others transform a yellow spot into the sun.","Colors, like features, follow the changes of the emotions.","Everything you can imagine is real.","Our goals can only be reached through a vehicle of a plan, in which we must fervently believe, and upon which we must vigorously act. There is no other route to success.","The artist is a receptacle for emotions that come from all over the place: from the sky, from the earth, from a scrap of paper, from a passing shape, from a spider's web.","I am always doing that which I cannot do, in order that I may learn how to do it.","Painting is just another way of keeping a diary.","My mother said to me, 'If you are a soldier, you will become a general. If you are a monk, you will become the Pope.' Instead, I was a painter, and became Picasso.","Every act of creation is first an act of destruction.","Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once we grow up.","Computers are useless. They can only give you answers.","I'd like to live as a poor man with lots of money.","Others have seen what is and asked why. I have seen what could be and asked why not.","There is no abstract art. You must always start with something. Afterward you can remove all traces of reality.","Inspiration exists, but it has to find us working.","Love is the greatest refreshment in life.","Painting is a blind man's profession. He paints not what he sees, but what he feels, what he tells himself about what he has seen.","God is really only another artist. He invented the giraffe, the elephant and the cat. He has no real style, He just goes on trying other things.","Give me a museum and I'll fill it.","Every positive value has its price in negative terms... the genius of Einstein leads to Hiroshima.","Only put off until tomorrow what you are willing to die having left undone.","Action is the foundational key to all success.","Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.","To copy others is necessary, but to copy oneself is pathetic.","Art is the lie that enables us to realize the truth.","Everything is a miracle. It is a miracle that one does not dissolve in one's bath like a lump of sugar.","There are only two types of women - goddesses and doormats.","To draw you must close your eyes and sing.","Sculpture is the art of the intelligence.","The chief enemy of creativity is 'good' sense.","Art is the elimination of the unnecessary.","I don't believe in accidents. There are only encounters in history. There are no accidents.","When you start with a portrait and search for a pure form, a clear volume, through successive eliminations, you arrive inevitably at the egg. Likewise, starting with the egg and following the same process in reverse, one finishes with the portrait.","The genius of Einstein leads to Hiroshima.","He can who thinks he can, and he can't who thinks he can't. This is an inexorable, indisputable law.","One does a whole painting for one peach and people think just the opposite - that particular peach is but a detail.","Why do two colors, put one next to the other, sing? Can one really explain this? no. Just as one can never learn how to paint.","Good artists copy, great artists steal.","It took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child.","The world today doesn't make sense, so why should I paint pictures that do?","The older you get the stronger the wind gets - and it's always in your face.","What might be taken for a precocious genius is the genius of childhood. When the child grows up, it disappears without a trace. It may happen that this boy will become a real painter some day, or even a great painter. But then he will have to begin everything again, from zero.","If only we could pull out our brain and use only our eyes.","Sculpture is the best comment that a painter can make on painting.","You have to have an idea of what you are going to do, but it should be a vague idea.","To finish a work? To finish a picture? What nonsense! To finish it means to be through with it, to kill it, to rid it of its soul, to give it its final blow the coup de grace for the painter as well as for the picture.","I do not seek. I find.","Are we to paint what's on the face, what's inside the face, or what's behind it?","It is your work in life that is the ultimate seduction.","I paint objects as I think them, not as I see them.","When I was a child, my mother said to me, 'If you become a soldier, you'll be a general. If you become a monk, you'll end up as the Pope.' Instead, I became a painter and wound up as Picasso.","Never permit a dichotomy to rule your life, a dichotomy in which you hate what you do so you can have pleasure in your spare time. Look for a situation in which your work will give you as much happiness as your spare time.","Art is a lie that makes us realize truth.","An idea is a point of departure and no more. As soon as you elaborate it, it becomes transformed by thought.","I begin with an idea and then it becomes something else.","We all know that Art is not truth. Art is a lie that makes us realize the truth, at least the truth that is given to us to understand.","We don't grow older, we grow riper.","Art is not the application of a canon of beauty but what the instinct and the brain can conceive beyond any canon. When we love a woman we don't start measuring her limbs.","What is a face, really? Its own photo? Its make-up? Or is it a face as painted by such or such painter? That which is in front? Inside? Behind? And the rest? Doesn't everyone look at himself in his own particular way? Deformations simply do not exist.","If there were only one truth, you couldn't paint a hundred canvases on the same theme.","You mustn't always believe what I say. Questions tempt you to tell lies, particularly when there is no answer.","I have a horror of people who speak about the beautiful. What is the beautiful? One must speak of problems in painting!","Success is dangerous. One begins to copy oneself, and to copy oneself is more dangerous than to copy others. It leads to sterility.","Is there anything more dangerous than sympathetic understanding?","Work is a necessity for man. Man invented the alarm clock.","Disciples be damned. It's not interesting. It's only the masters that matter. Those who create.","To make oneself hated is more difficult than to make oneself loved.","We must not discriminate between things. Where things are concerned there are no class distinctions. We must pick out what is good for us where we can find it.","The people who make art their business are mostly imposters.","The more technique you have, the less you have to worry about it. The more technique there is, the less there is.","When I die, it will be a shipwreck, and as when a huge ship sinks, many people all around will be sucked down with it.","If all the ways I have been along were marked on a map and joined up with a line, it might represent a minotaur.","One must act in painting as in life, directly.","They ought to put out the eyes of painters as they do goldfinches in order that they can sing better."],"Pablo Sandoval":["You learn from the things that happen in your career. You get up and down. You never give up. All the things that happened in my career, thank God it happened early rather than late in my career.","I'm moving forward to do the best.","I'm going to prove to the fans, going to prove to my teammates, that I can be a better defensive player, offensive player, to win games.","You try to live the experience but keep your feet on the ground, not let it go to your head, because that's when you start making mistakes.","We live surrounded by critics, so let them talk, let them criticize me as much as they want. Ultimately, that makes me a better player.","You've got keep your head up, keep fighting, and do the best you can.","I just prepare myself to perform well, to support my teammates to play well, to try to get to the final, to the World Series.","People want to help me. They want the best for me. I always say thank you to people when they try that. I never get mad.","You're going to have some ups and downs, so you have to prepare yourself to be ready. Those down moments come.","If it's going to go my way, it's going to go my way. I have to keep working hard.","I wanted to show my maturity. The criticism I got made me grow up. It motivated me.","The fan support was the greatest. It's everything.","It has not been easy to wake up every single day at 6:30 in the morning to then head to the gym and start a full day of work. But you have to have that kind of dedication if you want to achieve the goals you have set for yourself.","The people that I surround myself with now and my family, they are the key to my success.","I don't try to lose weight. I don't try to do nothing. I just try to put in my work, feel better, the things that I can do in the field to be better are better, so that's what I do.","It is not about money. It is about how you treat the player.","When our backs are on the wall, that's the time when we enjoy having fun, relax out there, do our thing, don't get the pressure on, see the results, day by day, game by game.","I'm happy. I learned. I learned from my mistakes. But when you learn, you see all the results; you look more mature, and you put all the pieces together.","I'm not selfish. I am where I am because I have worked very hard and have always done my job.","I just do my work, try to do everything I can. I don't weigh in all offseason. I just try to get better, be in better position, be an athlete.","I don't pay attention to the media. You guys can say whatever you want. At the end of the day, at the end of the season, if we're doing well, you guys are going to be there.","I trust no one - that microphone, that book.","I'm a professional, and I know what I have to do. I know where I've failed and how I've grown up.","I don't worry about numbers. I worry about wins. You can see all the years that my numbers went down and how many championships I've got. That's what I worry about.","What really matters is who you are when you step on the field, and I will let my bat and my glove speak for themselves.","When you're from another country, you want to spend time with your family. All your family can't come here. All your friends can't come here. You spend so much time here, you want to go there, too.","You need to learn. You need to grow up. You need to step up and know the difference between what you can do and what you can't.","It is difficult. You've got a lot of things outside the field. But you need to learn and understand things you can do.","I just keep happy and help the team when I get an opportunity.","I feel good not just physically but as a person because I know I accomplished my goal, which everybody said I couldn't do in Venezuela.","The taps with the bat on the spikes are one for my grandmother, one for my grandfather, one for my little sister. Then the one on the helmet is showing faith in God that I can do it.","Venezuelan baseball is more aggressive, more passionate, more exciting. The fans are not the same as in your native country.","My career had fallen into an abyss because I was so complacent with things that I had already accomplished. I did not work hard in order to achieve more and to remain at the level of the player that I am and that I can be.","I am not taking anything for granted.","I have no ill will about anything.","I have to prove everything. Especially when you're coming from an off year after the injuries, and you come back, and you have to prove a lot of things to the fans, to the team, to your teammates, to the sport. You have to prove a lot of things out there on the field.","I don't focus on the scale. I focus on doing my job. The team staff and the program I've been working on, they've been touching on that, but I don't focus on the scale.","During the season especially, we take a lot of swings, we play a lot of games, we swing a lot in games, batting practice, all that, so to maintain your shoulder the strongest is one of the key points that we focused on in the offseason.","In baseball... you don't stop learning until it's over.","If you don't have good people around you, it's going to be the worst thing for you.","I have always loved and appreciated the Giants organization, my Giants teammates, and the fans of San Francisco.","When I left the Giants in 2014, my comments were emotional, insensitive, and misguided, and I truly regret and apologize for my actions. I am committed to working hard to contributing to the success of the Giants.","Tell you the truth, the night before, I don't sleep. It's exciting to be in postseason, you fight one-hitter 62 games, you make it.","I want to play in the WBC. That was one of my goals to represent my country.","You're human; you make mistakes. You have to put all the things in the past.","I just want to do the best things I can do on the field, do the things I know how to in baseball, have fun.","Things happen for a reason. I'm happy, but not I'm not satisfied with the things I'm doing.","It's tough, but you learn your lesson from all the mistakes you make.","I'm more mature. I respect more the game as I should.","If I meant that I missed Bochy and Hunter, it's the guys I'd been joking around with most. Hunter is like my brother, and Bochy is like my dad. But at the end of the day, I missed all the guys.","I don't weigh. I don't weigh in at all.","When you do some things in baseball in the city where you grow up and then you come back on a second opportunity, it's special.","I wanted to come back with the team I grew up with.","All the things that are in the past are in the past.","I did not work hard in order to achieve more and to remain at the level of the player that I am and that I can be.","It was one of those things that I set forth as a goal after my surgery. I have been working very hard with the trainers and the team personnel."],"Pablo Schreiber":["My greatest desire as an actor is to keep people guessing and not do anything close to what I did last time.","I do want to play characters that have redeeming qualities, that are likable, for sure, and I have in the past, and I will again.","If there is a reason I'm able to make unsympathetic characters human, it's because it's my desire to find what drives the unsympathetic behavior. Almost always at the bottom of it is some deep insecurity. Putting your finger on what each individual's particular insecurity is goes a long way to fleshing that person out.","I got nominated for a Tony in my Broadway debut, which was fascinating and thrilling and sort of unbelievable all at the same time.","I have a tendency, just because I'm an ambitious person, to get impatient with things and want them to be moving faster then they are.","It's great to work in film and TV, and I love it, but there's nothing that can replace that instantaneous storytelling you get in theater.","I lived in Red Hook, Brooklyn, for about 10 years, and then we moved out to Jersey City after my wife and I bought a house up in the Catskills. I miss Brooklyn, but the commute to the Catskills is about 45 minutes shorter.","Acting is a hard way to make a living, and there's a kind of dark, somewhat seedy side to the whole aspect of fame and celebrity that's not really something I would want for my child - or want him to want, if that makes any sense.","I'm a dad and a husband, and so the things that I love to do are all geared around my family."],"Paddy Ashdown":["The greatest failure is that although we have created institutions, we have not created a civil society.","Bosnia is under my skin. It's the place you cannot leave behind. I was obsessed by the nightmare of it all; there was this sense of guilt, and an anger that has become something much deeper over these last years.","Maybe it's legitimate criticism, though it can be hurtful. Maybe I haven't paid sufficient attention to the people with whom I would have a natural affinity as a liberal, and they feel let down by that.","It's not my job to be popular. I'm goal-driven; my job is to get results.","We have invented a new human right here - the right to return home after a war.","My second job has been to try to use my power to create institutions of a modern state that could enter the European Union, and there was very little time. The door was closing, and I wanted to get Bosnia through before it shut.","I am here because I think it was a terrible sin of the west to allow those years of war.","I can create institutions, but I can't rewrite the chips in people's heads.","I can establish the expectation of retributive justice. Have we done that? No.","I don't think Bosnia is ready for reconciliation, but I do think it is ready for truth.","I was told there would be riots in the streets, but there were no riots.","I've had much nastier things said about me in the British press than in the Bosnian press.","It would be a foolish high representative who worked that way.","People do not want politicians they know to be corrupt.","Politics is compromise.","What my future will not be is active politics in the Liberal Democrat party.","I am formally accountable to the steering board of the PIC, and I meet with nine ambassadors from the PIC every week. I have to have the capitals' broad agreement with what I do.","I love this country, I love these people, though I can't say I love their politicians. People are always nicer than politicians, but here, you can mark that difference up a hundredfold.","The generous way of putting it is that we were not ready for this. The less generous way is to say: How was it possible to return to the politics of appeasement of the 1930s?","We have to make their livelihoods viable, get them the proper prices for their produce, try and make them stay rather than sell their property and leave again.","We who came here saw what was happening. This was far more than a war in a faraway place. This was a moral imperative, a terrible vision of the future.","It was a superb agreement to end a war, but a very bad agreement to make a state. From now on, we have to part company with Dayton and try to build a modern democratic state, for which I have tried to lay the foundations.","It works both ways: there are victims of tragedy who come to me who have experienced grief of such magnitude that they cannot reconcile. Likewise, I cannot change the mentality of those who committed the crimes or the fools who followed them.","Politics is about putting yourself in a state of grace."],"Paddy Chayefsky":["It's always the generals with the bloodiest records who are the first to shout what a hell it is. And it's always the war widows who lead the Memorial Day parades.","Artists don't talk about art. Artists talk about work. If I have anything to say to young writers, it's stop thinking of writing as art. Think of it as work.","Television is democracy at its ugliest.","I'm a man without a corporation.","God save us from people who do the morally right thing. It's always the rest of us who get broken in half.","You don't send a man to his death because you want a hero.","You British plundered half the world for your own profit. Let's not pass it off as the Age of Enlightenment."],"Paddy Considine":["You walk past people in streets, or they serve you in shops, and you know nothing about the horrors they may be living with.","It's such a stressful environment, I find, being an actor, being put in the chair and 'Touch this, that, and the other,' it's too much for me. I find it hard to tolerate that sort of stuff. If you're not enjoying it, don't do it. You're wasting everyone's time.","I live in a state of hypersensitivity, and I've always had this feeling that something bad is going to happen to myself, or my wife and children. This manifests itself in different fears and visions.","I have to believe there's redemption in the darkest of circumstances; otherwise it's too bleak for me.","I could never sit down and say: I'm going to do an out-and-out comedy, just to prove to people I can. You've just got to do what you do. Just listen to your soul and do your art and do it for the right reasons, and then you can't fail.","I can't afford to step away from acting, but the one thing I've learnt after all these years is that I don't fit in. It's very difficult to be at the mercy of other people's whims and visions.","I think the older that I'm getting, the more I'm understand what a privileged job I have, and what an opportunity I have. Now I'm directing films and I'm getting my first movie in America off the ground, and you start to understand how the system really works.","When you're having conversations about actors, you realize these same conversations have happened about you. If you want to make a film for $5m, then you cast A, B and C, but if you want $20m, you won't be able to cast them, you need X, Y and Z.","The more I find out about the dynamic and how it works, the more I realize how lucky I am to have ever got anything. Like... there was no need to put me in 'Cinderella Man' - there was no need. Why? Just get an American actor - it would've been cheaper, probably.","Being a director is almost like being another sort of character, but you're out of view.","With directors, some have a kind of in-built ability to just know how to work with actors and get the best out of actors, and some don't have a clue about acting. I think it'd be a good idea if directors put themselves in front of the camera, or even went on a six-week drama course, just to know a little bit about what that feels like.","I think it's a shame when the arts have to suffer because of corporate greed. People will always strive to make film, and the only important thing is that we keep trying to make ourselves heard and keep making our films, no matter what the climate is.","It's different being a director. I suppose, especially if it's a story you've written and you feel compelled to tell, in some ways it's a lot easier than acting because you're orchestrating the piece. As an actor, sometimes you're trying to second-guess what people want.","I worked with some directors, and it was really collaborative, and I was sort of writing with them. I was giving so many pieces of myself to their movies, I thought, 'It's about time I use my own voice for me, and establish my own voice.' So I knew I wanted to make films.","People can very quickly have a very poor self-image. It doesn't take much.","The thing is, if I try to talk about acting, I come off as moaning. But I'm privileged. I think it's all about control. Acting is vulnerable because you're not in control of anything. You have to give up a lot of your trust; it's up to somebody else what they do with what you've given them.","At the end of the day, my life isn't about other people's work. I've got to stop giving stuff away. I've got my own stories to tell, and a great need to tell them. I've got these images, these thoughts in my head, and I need to find a way to cope with them.","I'll admit, sometimes I've paid the bills with acting. You know the phrase, 'It's one for the money, two for the showreel.' I don't want that as a director. I don't want to compromise myself. There's a big old wide world out there. I want to explore it.","There is nothing worse than when actors come to a set - and it happens a lot with big stars - and they are too aware of where the camera is. They are the show. And that becomes apparent and it affects the production. I am like 'You should not know where the camera is - you should act, and I will do the rest.'","I got through with my ability to mimic others and make people laugh. I swaggered through life, but, in reality, I lived in fear pretty much every day. I acted like a completely normal person, and I suppose I was good at it. But, inside, it was a very different story.","Since being diagnosed with Asperger's, I'd been working with an acting coach who has now become a good friend. We'd been trying lots of improvisational techniques to help me with some of the problems I experience. But it's a very slow process.","I suppose I just had this Christian idea about how I ought to go about my life. I thought, 'If I work really hard and have a bit of success, the problems I'd had all my life would leave me.' But, of course, not a bit of it left me because Asperger's is not something you just get over or grow out of.","There's no social realism in 'Tyrannosaur.' It's not about the social landscape or the political landscape or any of that. It's just about human beings. I never made 'Tyrannosaur' in reference to anybody - I just made it because I had to make my own films.","It was important that I got my own voice out there in the world. I'd used it on other people's films, collaborated, and I thought, 'You know, I can do this myself.' That was more important than anything else.","A lecturer once told me I could never be a director. I was 16. I believed him.","What's my dilemma here? Am I making entertainment or am I making art? What am I saying? At the end of the day, cinema is entertainment for millions of people, but for me it's expression.","I'm trying to make sense of lot of things with 'Tyrannosaur.' I'm trying to make sense of people who've left now. They're not here, they can't answer for themselves any more, they're gone. And I'm trying to make peace with those ghosts.","'Tyrannosaur's an arrival for me, but it's also the first step into a new career. I don't want to be moonlighting at this, like I have done with acting. Y'know, I think I've found my career at 37 years old.","I don't want to be disrespectful to people who are incredible at their craft, but the truth is, if I didn't get paid for it, I wouldn't act. The best-paying jobs are usually the worst films. You're a very small cog in a big machine.","All of a sudden I'm an actor, and I spend a decade trying to fit in and realising that I didn't, really. Sometimes in the right circumstances, with the right people, it felt OK. But other times it was a bit more jobbing. I didn't fit the mould, somehow.","I know victims of domestic abuse. I know what it takes for people to get out, and I also know why people stay. It's heartbreaking.","My fascination is not for cinema; it's for human nature and human beings because I find it quite difficult being one at times.","All you've got to do is turn up and have a few facial tics and be a lunatic and throw someone around the room or blow their brains out and people think it's good acting.","I would hate to be thrust into the middle of a big film and not deliver. There's young actors and they're put into these central roles and they're commanding armies - but they can't quite pull it off. I'd much rather do it in small steps and build it from there.","I watched 'Rocky' and 'Raging Bull' and 'Taxi Driver' over and over again. They spoke to you, man."],"Padgett Powell":["An indigo snake leaves a lasting impression.","Conversations are the most direct way to connect with people.","Travel writing is harrowing. You are in paradise, more or less, having to prove it is paradise. It is hard to have a good time trying to figure out a way to say you are having a good time, whether you are having it or not, even in paradise.","I know about the sweet home. I went to school with 'em boys, what became Lynyrd Skynyrd; I knew Allen Collins, the skinny girl-beautiful guitarist. I put Allen Collins in every travel piece I do. Travel writing is harrowing, going to Bermuda with a banjo on my knee.","I don't write anything if I'm not agreeable and liking it. I'm not one of these slavers who wads up paper. It comes or it doesn't.","I was always the new kid, and I got to know the language and the politics of being on the outside, looking in. Never being in the clique - always being a student of the clique, a subversive, and I could look around and identify the other guys who were excluded.","All this is rather pretentious and fey to even talk about, but Flannery O'Connor sat down to write stories. The rest of us, some of us, don't have that kind of wit and genius. We don't do that. We sit down and have some accidents.","Military brats have this toughness: they're almost like orphans or foster children; they develop little mechanisms. It sets you up to look at things a little differently.","When I write, I want something to sound good itself.","If you're going to write a book that might, in its very best accidental career, sell 30,000 copies, you've got to have a day job.","It's hard to say conversation has become a minimal thing, because look at the rise of mobile communications in the last 10 years. It used to be only the president had a mobile phone. Now everyone on earth, even if they have nothing else, they have a cell phone.","Writing books is a nice retreat. There's nothing quite like diving into a book for a few hours. That is a big time vacation.","I've had an addiction for a long time to the whole business of maximizing one's potential, what I call human activation. The vehicle for actualizing oneself is choice, options, seeking out the proper choices.","In my experience, great reviews almost always ensure no sales.","I think William Trevor is as good as it gets. Whenever I want a book to do exactly what it says it will, I read him.","I've sat down and written with a more or less supportable or insupportable idea or thing to say, and it ends. When it's not 200 pages, people want to call it a story. I guess they're entitled to do that. In my view, if it were a supportable idea, it would have gone 200 pages, and it didn't.","I don't write with a scheme or a plan. I write word to word, so whatever that first sentence is, having said that, one more or less had to say what comes next and next and next. Guilty of no cogitation or forethought.","I stuff animals I find; I do roadkill. They're strangely fun to have. They're like easy-to-control pets.","Every other year, I was the new boy. I found that the only way to survive was to embrace it, make a little fortress on the outside and to pretend to blend in but not to invest too much because you'll be somewhere else next year.","I met Donald Barthelme when I was 30, and it's fair to say that before that moment, I was pre-modern, and after I met him, I was nudged rather forcefully towards this other end of the spectrum.","They got into fact checking at the 'Paris Review,' and it was mortifying. There was a wrangle about Hemingway's lost stories that nearly killed me. It turns out he didn't lose those stories. They weren't stolen from the platform.","I was a commercial roofer before this, until about age thirty. I will not work others under me and do not want to work under others.","I am writing a book more improbable than 'The Interrogative Mood' that I call 'Manifesto'. It's two guys talking who speak artificially conveniently.","I sat down and wrote, 'Are your emotions pure? Are they the stuff of heroes or the alloyed mess of the beaten? How do you stand in relation to the potato?' And it was a lot of fun, and I kept going and woke up at some point in some horror that I had about 142 pages of this.","Many parks in Florida have information kiosks with colorful enamel signs showing the special flora and fauna in the park. The gopher tortoise, the scrub jay, the indigo snake. At no park with an indigo snake on its kiosk signs could I find an indigo.","As a boy, I was a member of a club run by the famous reptile showman Ross Allen, and the club sent its members pseudoscientific papers mimeographed on construction paper with a three-hole punch.","Bermuda is not even tropical. The charm of the tropics - the heat, the chaos - is not there.","Christmas is the season I use to clock failure in life. It stops time, as it were, on the year - where you are in it, where you are in your travail unto the grave.","I associate the truest spirit of Christmas with certain years when I had to spend it at my parents' house as an adult who had, presumably, escaped.","At every Christmas, I fail to remember the daughters' shoe sizes, and they are not growing, but grown. After ostensible hard thought about who needs what, I have failed to give good gifts; I have failed to receive good gifts.","If I slip up and receive a good gift, I will not have given a good gift. This is probably a natural law that affects us all and needs a name. The Gift Reciprocal Law."],"Padma Lakshmi":["I like me better naked. I don't mean that in a vain way... When you put clothes on, you immediately put a character on. Clothes are adjectives, they are indicators. When you don't have any clothes on, it's just you, raw, and you can't hide.","I love seafood. I'm not a vegetarian but I'm probably a pescetarian.","In truth, I am a single mother. But I don't feel alone at all in parenting my daughter. Krishna has a whole other side of her family who loves her, too. And so Krishna is parented by me, but also by her grandmother and aunts and cousins and uncles and friends.","My first taste memory is pickle. Even as a kid, I was really weird. I liked chillis. I used to climb up the shelves in my grandmother's pantry. The pickle jar was kept right at the top. One time, I dropped the jar and it broke. I was totally busted.","I'm not attached to things at all. I'm very lucky to have quite a few beautiful things, but if I look back at my life, I was often happiest when I had very little.","Jewelry should not upstage you. I pick one hot point on my body that I'm going to highlight. Let one area do the singing - you don't want to hear three songs at once.","I usually doze off between 7:30 and 9 p.m. while putting my baby to sleep. Then I suddenly wake up remembering I'm an adult with no bedtime. I spend the next four hours catching up on reading, e-mails, and other adult pursuits until I collapse for good until sunrise.","I've always thought the back is one of the most beautiful parts of a woman. I've created four versions of the front-to-back necklace which actually gives you two necklaces in one. I love the way they swing and catch the light as a woman is walking away. You almost want to pull on it and stop her!","People always comment about my clothes. They don't think a fashionable woman can love food and be knowledgeable and actually cook.","I've always had a fantasy to write a cookbook, because everyone wants to know what a model eats.","It doesn't matter how precisely the onion is cut as long as the person chewing it is happy.","I know most people use their phones to tell time, but there's something very romantic and beautiful about a timepiece.","People are thrown off by someone who looks feminine, but is also strong. It's not that pretty girls aren't smart, it's that women aren't strong.","Wine, like food, is so emotional. If you think about it, so much of the courting ritual is surrounded by wine and food. There's a built-in romance to wine.","I was the first Indian model to have a career in Paris, Milan and New York.","I'm the kind of girl who thinks about what she's gonna cook for dinner when she's finishing her lunch.","Where is it written that a smart woman can't also be stacked?","I'm not tough. I'm tenacious.","I don't have any stigma attached to my body. When I'm in my own private space, I have very little on.","I was lucky to have a successful career as a model, but that was just a way to pay off my college loans.","The cookbooks and the writing in general have been a real bonus, but it's not something I've ever pursued... I've been lucky, I guess.","For a while, I became an atheist; now that I'm grown up, though, I'm not hard-edged enough to be an atheist. Even though I live with a flaming atheist, I love going to temple. I love all the rituals.","I love clothes, but really I don't have that much to say about skirts. Before I was writing, I went to fashion shows only when the designer was a good friend and I was there to show support.","The best thing you can do for someone is make them a beautiful plate of food. How else can you invade someone's body without actually touching them?","I'm not of the American ilk that, you know, your lover needs to be your best friend and know you inside out. I think he should know you well enough to please you. Otherwise, what secret will there be to tell him when you're ninety?","All chefs are like Jewish mothers. They want to feed you and feed you and impress you. It's an eagerness to please.","I tend to sleep in the nude... I'm a sensual-leaning woman. You have to use the word 'leaning' or it sounds like I'm boasting.","I think wine is such a big universe that it's kind of like food - it's intimidating to a lot of people, myself included.","If you like a wine that you drink, now with your phone, it's so easy. Just take a picture of the label. You learn about it. You learn where it comes from and what the soil is like and why you like it. And that'll lead you to another wine.","Flowers die and wine gets consumed. Both are lovely. I appreciate both. Wine and roses. I actually had someone bring me a lobe of foie gras once.","I've been a model for 15 years, and I've been on 'Top Chef' for eight seasons, and before that I had other cooking shows, so I've learned a thing or two about how to camouflage certain areas and how to draw the eye to a preferable area of the body.","You don't need expensive classes and all kinds of weird equipment if you really want to be in shape. There are great ways to do it that are very economical, it just takes a time commitment, even if it means waking up a half hour a day before the rest of the household gets up because that's the only time you have.","My mom was scared of the old Times Square so I was never allowed to go. Now I'm scared of the new Times Square, so I still never go.","Every city has a Donald Trump; ours is just the Trumpiest.","You don't want your jewelry to make you look fat. A lot of what's out there now does - you just wind up looking like a Christmas tree.","Whether I'm making a recipe or a piece of jewelry or a white-rose-and-jasmine tea or the perfume, I like to think of myself as a happy little sorceress, and if I could just have a little general store with all that stuff and give people a sense of my taste, that would be lovely.","For a long time, I didn't know what I wanted to be when I grew up. I was desperate to find something that fit me and I just decided that if I could organically make a professional living out of the things that interested me, then I would be a happy person.","I'm an immigrant kid who came to America from India when I was very young and grew up in New York City with a single mom and really was influenced by all of those immigrant cultures bumping up against each other.","Every country I would go to, even if it was just on a modeling job, I would go to their markets. If I went to Morocco for 'Elle' magazine, I would be in the spice markets during my off time and just come back with a suitcase full of stuff that I really wanted to try.","I am a sufferer of endometriosis. I didn't want any young women to go through what I went through. I thought that people should know about it.","I really like to sometimes go into food detox and eat very simply.","Part of my job as a food writer is to describe food. So my work on 'Top Chef,' I feel, is an extension of that. When we give a criticism to the contestant, we want to make sure we tell them why it's not working and why it would work if they did it a different way.","I have great empathy for all the contestants that come on 'Top Chef,' whether they go home right away or they make it to the finish line. It's a very vulnerable position they put themselves in and I feel for them.","I grew up a vegetarian. Then, because I grew up in the states, I started slowly eating meat. First it was bologna sandwiches, or pepperoni on pizza.","I think eating in itself is the act of great sensuality, so all you have to do is point the camera in the right direction.","I work out all the time! I don't just sit around and eat burgers whenever I want. Oh, if I could I probably would, but I don't.","One thing that happens when you're pregnant is that as your stomach starts to stretch. It itches! So I have to keep my belly really lubricated. Every morning, there's a buttering ceremony after I get out of the shower. It's really like basting a turkey with body butter.","I am as omnivorous as it's possible to be. I always say there's nothing I won't eat and nothing I won't wear.","During the course of filming 'Top Chef,' I gain 15 lbs., so I'm used to needing two dress sizes.","I never Tweet about my daughter. Never. I just want to be respectful of her privacy. My job as a mom is to know when to open my mouth and when not to.","I wasn't like those girls who give birth and are back on the runway. It took me probably six months to gain 45 pounds and I would say it took me double that time to lose it.","I love to use a lot of spices when I cook, so we actually cast a real peppercorn in gold and then just made a bead out of it for necklaces and earrings.","Whenever I'm in sync with the trends, it's always an accident. I still love wearing clothes I've had for ten years. I think understated luxury is the chicest thing.","From the simple stringing together of lemon garlands for the goddess Durga, to dividing the prasadam or blessed foods for the children first, I came to associate food not only with feminity, but also with purity and divinity."],"Padmasree Warrior":["I think one challenge is that having few women in your work environment makes you feel a little isolated and alone. I'm an extrovert; I like talking to people, and I make friends easily, but if your personality is somewhat different, I think you would struggle to connect with people.","Tech is all about building human connections.","My mom taught me the power of love. I learned to focus on the long-term big picture from my father. His sense of humor and light-hearted approach always make me smile. My husband is a pivotal anchor in my life. His influence encourages me to be independent and take risks.","I don't like the word 'balance.' To me, that somehow conjures up conflict between work and family... as long as we think of these things as conflicting, we will never have happiness. True happiness comes from integration... of work, family, self, community.","I'm thrilled to be joining Gap Inc., a company that understands the importance of integrating technology and retail in ways that improve the lives of its customers.","While technology empowers us to remain connected all the time, it's up to us as people to decide when is it not appropriate to be connected... to opt out when you need to.","I've taken Saturdays to be the day I pull back completely. I do things that are more creative, and I've actually found that helps me when I get back into work to be more thoughtful, and I truly believe that feeding your creative soul is really important to being more analytical.","When my son was growing up, I was always guilty, no matter what I did. Make decisions and be happy with the decisions you've made. I tell myself, in the long run, it's the love, the quality of relationships that you have with your family, your friends and giving back to the community that matters.","I have seen women who are very interested in tech finish their graduate or undergraduate degrees, but then choose not to pursue a career in tech because they're not sure they want to spend the next 20-30 years in an industry that's very male dominated.","I always tell women that the fact that you're different and that you're noticed, because there are few of us in the tech industry, is something you can leverage as an advantage.","People remember my last name because it's different, and people remember me in meetings because I dress differently from other people just because I'm a woman. Those kinds of things give you an opportunity and a spotlight, so use that to your advantage. Use it as a platform to demonstrate your knowledge and your capabilities.","When I took my first job, I was among only a handful of women. It was isolating at times. My love for technology kept me going, and I got to where I am today driven by my passion and self confidence.","I always tell women to use the fact that we offer a different point of view in a room full of men, to their advantage. Because we often stand out, we gain a unique platform to demonstrate our knowledge and capabilities.","There is an outdated belief that girls are not as good at science and math subjects as boys. But according to the report 'Generation STEM,' high school girls earn more math and science credits than boys do, and their GPAs, aggregated across math and science classes, are higher than boys'.","For me personally, the technology that has taken the most unexpected turn in my lifetime is what I refer to as 'the device formerly known as the cell phone.' I still remember many predictions that by 2000 there would only be about a million cell phone users. Boy, were they ever wrong!","You go to a technology conference or an engineering conference, there are very few women there. At the same time it's a blessing in the fact that you do get noticed. People tend to remember you as the only woman in the room 'who said that', or the only woman in the room who was an engineer.","The first wave of the Internet was really about data transport. And we didn't worry much about how much power we were consuming, how much cooling requirements were needed in the data centers, how big the data center is in terms of real estate. Those were almost afterthoughts.","In the future, it's going to move from being just a data transport to really becoming a media experience platform. The Internet will be more about media, more about collaboration, much more virtualized and much more green.","If I had to pick three of my favorite magazines, they would be 'Fast Company', 'Silicon India', and 'Smithsonian.'","When I present or speak, I write the slides myself. And regarding time, I would like to be able to publish more than I do.","I think social media, it in a way forces companies to be more authentic or more transparent because it gives a voice to the consumer and a reach to the consumer that they didn't have before.","I think the adoption rate with respect to social media and how companies leverage that varies by the company. Cisco is probably a leader in the space. A lot of times, we actually use virtual ways to communicate our brand and do some of our advertising, first on the social space, then we do on physical advertising.","If you think about Cisco's offerings like TelePresence, where it's an immersive way to communicate for businesses to connect and have conversations in a real-time immersive mode, how that will change health care, how that'll change retail business, how that'll change actually travel. There's lots of changes that we will see going forward.","I have 1.4 million followers on Twitter. I get very interesting, sometimes very diverse input from my followers. So it's sort of like this water cooler, digital water cooler, if you want to think about it, where you go and you listen to conversations that are happening that perhaps will shape your thinking.","Regardless of the technology, we at Cisco believe that there is a need to 'connect the unconnected,' whether it is using 3G, 4G or Wi-Fi. We are working on enabling heterogeneous access across different technologies. The basic need to 'connect to unconnected' still remains.","For the user, it doesn't matter whether he is getting access on Wi-Fi, 3G or 2G networks. What matters is good connectivity, and as a technology provider, our job is to hide the complexity of the technology."],"Page McConnell":["Every piece has its own identity which we develop by the rule 'We know no limits.' We follow the inspiration of the moment and don't worry if what we're playing is alternative, progressive or fusion rock.","You can't force something like that. But we have encouraged our audience, because we avoid the confrontation of regular rock concerts: us up here, you down there. Instead, we're looking for interaction.","Each of our 900 shows so far was different - maybe that's what makes the fans come back to our gigs time and again. And that they're always part of the show. Phish concerts are a communal experience.","My dad also plays a little banjo and guitar, my mom plays the mandolin.","I didn't have bands that I was playing with growing up, so I learned to try to adapt and play these songs that were guitar songs on the piano, and sing them.","You never know where your influences are going to come from, or where you're going to find your inspiration.","If you can play live and support yourself, it's one of the few ways you're going to actually get paid in this business these days."],"Paget Brewster":["After six wonderful years playing Emily Prentiss, I have decided it's time for me to move on. As much as I will miss my 'Criminal Minds' family, I am excited about the future and other opportunities.","I'm not saying anything to denigrate 'Criminal Minds'; that's a great show. I just didn't appreciate it anymore. I appreciate those people, but I realized my heart wasn't in and I needed to go because plenty of people would rip their arm off to be on that show, so they should be.","If you try to break into my house, you will be severely lacerated and possibly electrocuted, and I'm fine with that. Because if you're breaking into my house, you're on your own.","Oh, my dating skills are the worst. No, I pick the wrong men; it's amazing. I am awful, the worst dater.","I know how to fake someone out, if they break into my house, into thinking there are other people there.","When you're on an ensemble show and you're messing around with everybody every day and you're not in every scene, and then all of a sudden you're in every scene, it's rough.","I'm 43 now. I've reached the point where I really can't care what anyone thinks. Of course, I do. I'm an actress. I'm totally insecure, but I'm trying to stick to my guns about what is important to me, and it doesn't matter what anyone thinks I should or shouldn't do.","I know so many people who are so much better at it than I am, and I think I'm a goofier person rather than a serious, dramatic actress, so I probably belong in comedy.","I'm not a super-actorly actor, my-body-is-an-instrument type of person, but I do want to do fun, exciting, interesting things. I have a 2001 PT Cruiser. I saved my money so I can take my time and choose something that I think is great, and that's what I'm waiting for.","I've done a show at the Largo Theater called The 'Thrilling Adventure Hour.' We read, like, radio teleplays. It's a send-up of radio dramas from the '30s and '40s. We just did a Kickstarter for that so that we can do a web series and a concert film.","There's great stuff out there, but I prefer doing a TV show, going to work every day with the same people, and a lot of stuff is not being shot in Los Angeles and I don't really want to do that because my loved ones are here.","I really didn't feel challenged anymore. I wanted to learn something and be excited again... While it can be a family - that environment is actually a family - in the sense that also you sometimes hate each other, you can't stand being around each other and grudges are held... I was getting cranky on 'Criminal Minds.'","When I was asked to leave, I left... Then they made me come back. I did, and I decided to enjoy it. It was one year. I care about everyone at 'Criminal Minds' but I knew, in my heart, I had left.","I like everybody at 'Criminal Minds.' I would like to guest star, but I don't know if that is in the cards.","People come over, and we watch things like 'The Paul Lynde Halloween Special.' I have a hot tub. Everybody puts on a bathing suit and we splash around.","I'm like this wiry freak they pulled out of a bar two months ago and said, 'Let's throw it on the wall and see if it sticks.'"],"Paige Butcher":["I've always only wanted to model. It really is the only life I want.","My mother was a fashion designer, and my father was a model.","Living in New York after 14 years, I'm such an outdoors kind of person. I love gardening and building things. I like restoring old furniture.","Actually, I'm not a gym rat. I'm not a gym person - I've never been. I've always been blessed to be thin. If I'm waiting for the kettle to boil, I'm doing 15 lunges.","I've always wanted to do charity stuff. I'm such a nurturer and love taking care of people."],"Paige Craig":["I've built employee perks programs before and it's impossible to manually build a program that makes everyone happy. I'd make a deal with one gym then hear about another gym an employee would prefer. As a small business owner, I didn't have the time or leverage to negotiate and manage dozens of vendor relationships.","Customers are using BetterWorks in a number of creative ways to reward and incentivize employees.","The Bay Area definitely knows the pain of competing for, and retaining, top talent. Offering interesting perks has become a necessity, not a nice-to-have.","When you read about the best places to work, it's never about salary; it's about catered lunches, the daycare - it's the cool stuff that matters.","L.A. has always had a ton of creative business people, but tech has always been trumped by Hollywood. Now Hollywood is realizing it needs to be smarter in tech. Hollywood is finally crossing over, and it's really going to charge L.A. to be the next tech center.","Anytime something eats too much of my life, I kill it.","When you're doing a startup, life is not all roses and rainbows, like you see on Instagram, and killing it.","If people make a lot of introductions, should they get recognized for it? I've never seen a score showing who's a good connector. That'd be useful, right?","Medicine, you have to take it. A vitamin is nice to have, but honestly, you can skip it.","As an HR Manager, you don't have to build a top-down perks program. You decide how much you want to invest in your employees, and then you give your employees the control to build a custom perk package for themselves.","I like big thinkers who, no matter how big their vision, can sit down and talk to me about hour-to-hour, day-to-day type stuff they do to move the ball forward."],"Paige Davis":["The best thing about New York is everything is available. Whatever you want, New York has got it!","I'm basically for the whole year just traveling with three suitcases.","I think even when homeowners love their room, it's still a shock, because you left your house, went to sleep, came home and your room was dramatically and drastically different.","These rooms are decorated in two days. It's all kept secret. The neighbors spend the night in each other's home. They don't see their finished room until the end of the second day. They have no say what happens in their own home.","You really can't turn on TLC without seeing us."],"Paige O'Hara":["I'm older and wiser, but I still dream of doing new things and creating new things.","I've been working with Disney all these years doing voice work, and now I'm signed with Disney Fine Arts, doing 'Beauty and the Beast' oil paintings. So it's been an ongoing wonderful job."],"Paige Turco":["You need to talk about sex with a sense of humor, especially because sex is a sensitive area for a lot of people.","I do want people to see me as a well-rounded actress, not just someone who plays in 'Turtle' movies."],"Paige VanZant":["I am very much a girly girl as well as being this tough, athletic fighter. I grew up a tomboy. I got my first four wheeler when I was eight. I got my first dirt bike shortly after. So, I have a lot of these manly qualities, I guess you would say. But, I also like to go get dressed up every weekend.","I've always been a bubbly and energetic and happy person, but when I get upset, I get frustrated; when someone makes me mad, I definitely have a temper, and I've had to deal with having a temper my whole life.","I'm just going to be myself; there's no reason for me to try and go out there and put a certain facade on or emphasize, 'Hey, I'm this. You need to believe it.' I just want to be the best that I can be, and if people like me, that's great, and if they don't, they don't.","I definitely want to be an inspiration or a role model for all the little girls out there or anyone out there that wants to break stereotypes. I feel like I'm breaking stereotypes with what I'm doing. I'm not the typical fighter, and there's a lot of people out there that won't do something just because they don't fit the stereotype.","I've been blessed; I've been getting so many amazing opportunities because of the UFC. I know there are going to be haters no matter how successful I am, and I just have to be thankful for all the blessings that I have because all of it can be over before you know it.","I try to eat healthy for the most part. When I cut weight, I cut pretty much everything out. I don't have protein when I cut weight other than what I might get from something like chicken breast. So I don't eat any extra protein, just because I'm trying to get the weight off. That's the only real diet I have.","I gave up school. I gave up a really, really good job. I gave up a lot of stuff. I cut a lot of people out of my life so I could just focus on my fighting dreams.","I strictly want to beat every opponent I face, whether it's for a title or for a small show. The only thing for me is winning my fights and being the best athlete I can be.","Honestly, at times, I still get bored. 'Dancing with the Stars' kept me busy, and that's what I like. When I first started fighting, I was working two jobs, and I was still going to school at the same time while training. I'm meant to be a busy person.","You can't go into the cage and not love it, and you can't go in there unprepared. You have to prepare.","When I'm training, I cater a little bit to my opponents.","I train for whatever happens. I'm prepared for wherever the fight goes.","CrossFit is just another thing I've become passionate about. I like to continue to make gains and compete with myself. There's many ways to do that either with adding weight or competing with my own times or my previous records. It's been nothing but a benefit to me, and I love lifting weights.","There's a lot of girls out there that can relate to me. They can look at me and see themselves a little bit. There's a lot of girls out there that have a tougher side to them. I just think that people are really grown and attracted to that, and that's why people like to see me fight.","I've always been very competitive, and I've always had this desire to win my entire life. I guess when it comes to being in the cage, especially, I just hate losing more than I like to win. The idea of someone beating me just doesn't sit well.","I am a huge wrestling fan. I would say The Rock is my favorite person to watch for obvious reasons.","There is a lot more to me than just being a crazy fighter.","'Dancing with the Stars' was a really great experience. People were definitely surprised that I'm a fighter, or they couldn't believe I'm a professional fighter, but I feel like I'm going to get that for a while. I'm excited to bring a new demographic over to MMA and the UFC.","I do Athlete Devotion throughout all my fight camps. I am a Christian, so I fight with God first, and I have my devotions with me everywhere I go.","I needed something to challenge myself a little more. I found fighting, and it completely fit my personality.","My dad grew up wrestling. He knew Ken Shamrock, and I didn't know who he was at the time. So, he found out that Shamrock was in a gym in Reno, and he wanted me to go try a class with him. I tried it and fell in love the first day. Ken told me that I had potential in this sport, and he's the reason I kept at it.","I was in culinary school for a little while, but it was just too hard to cut weight and cook at the same time.","Sunday, I go to church; I take the day off. I rest.","I think the hardest thing I went through in the UFC was my first loss. It was terrible. It was traumatizing. But it's just going back and rebuilding and getting better.","Winning my first UFC fight by a finish, I've never felt so accomplished in my life.","I would love to go do movies; I would love to kind of delve into other things. I did do acting and modeling before, when I was a kid, so it would be nice to use those things.","I have so many other talents other than fighting, and I would love to be able to show those off. I would like to say, 'Yes, I'm a fighter, and I'm this,' or, 'Yes I'm a fighter, but I'm also this.'","If I wasn't a fighter, I wouldn't be unique.","You have to try to grow between every fight: get back in the gym and keep working hard and find the areas that you need to work on. See what you did wrong and work on it.","Sometimes the media twists your words, and they say things to get a headline, and it's not necessarily what came out of your mouth, and they take things out of context 90 percent of the time. But I guess - any publicity is good publicity, I guess.","For me, I've been known as a very well-rounded fighter, and I think that's really important, that you're well rounded and comfortable in every situation that a fight can go. A lot of people focus on just one discipline, and when they get out of that, they're in a difficult position.","I like ground and pound; I don't know if it is like a technique or discipline. I like to be on the ground, but I don't necessarily go for submissions or anything.","I think the reason why people have trouble fighting me is because I don't come from a specific background, and they can't prepare to fight me. I come in, and I push the pace, and I think that pushes a lot of people off their game, as much as I push the pace through the whole fight.","In fighting, you're not going 200 mph, but there's obviously danger in the sport. If you're a fighter or a NASCAR driver, you're obviously an adrenaline junkie. Both also take a lot of skill.","After I won my first amateur fight, I figured I would do fighting on the side while I was going to school. I got an offer after that amateur fight to take a professional fight. The opponent kind of wanted to have an easy win for her pro debt, and they said they'd pay me $1,500. I was like, 'Yeah, might as well get paid for what I was doing.'","When I started training to fight, it was more out of boredom than anything. I was looking for more things to do. I started with boxing, and my coaches told me I had a lot of potential and that I should consider making it a career. I was like, 'Whatever.' I was just 15 at the time, and I never imagined something like that.","I don't go into a fight mad. I go into a fight like it's my birthday. I love what I'm doing."],"Palaniappan Chidambaram":["I readily concede that a prime minister is not required to speak on every occasion or on every subject, but when there is a duty to speak, silence is unacceptable. Silence can be a strategy, silence can be a tactic, but silence can never be an answer to the ills of our polity and the fault lines of our society.","I belong to the Congress. My party has always supported prohibition, though it may not have been successful in implementing prohibition in many states.","Once the war of words begins, truth is the casualty.","Not all ideas will be accepted, but every idea deserves its own space, and every idea deserves to be expressed.","I firmly believe that the Constitution is the most powerful challenge to illiberal tendencies. If the Constitution is followed in letter and spirit and if the laws are made in the spirit in which Constitution was made, liberties can indeed be protected.","I don't think anyone has qualms in saying victory to the people of India. But when a political party appropriates such a slogan and says this is the definition of patriotism, those who say it are patriotic and those who don't are not patriotic, then I reject that definition.","I think preaching equality among unequals is the worst form of discrimination.","Corruption is not the sole test of your worthiness to form the government.","As far as the Congress is concerned, we condemn any attempts to oppress the Dalits in strongest terms. If there are parties trying to fan the OBC-Dalit divide in Tamil Nadu, we need to collectively condemn them.","Pakistan is not a rogue state, but it harbours and covertly supports rogue elements. While war is not the answer, hard or coercive diplomacy could be.","Unfortunately, terror is now linked to immigration, and anyone with dark skin or a beard or a Muslim name is suspect. Russia, France, then the United Kingdom, and now even Germany have no qualms about going far beyond their borders to strike at the enemies of their countries.","A government must always be prepared for the unexpected."],"Pallam Raju":["Developing skills is as important as training. A larger effort is needed to create a skilled workforce with employment potential.","The Indian youth needs to be empowered, and it can be done through good education and vocational training.","While China succeeded in transferring nearly 150 million people from agriculture to manufacturing, we could not do so, due to lack of skilled manpower.","There should be more interaction and more confidence building between our various academic institutions just like how there needs to be a confidence building between industry and academics.","I think it is very important to build the moral fibre of the youth. Moral education should be part of the curriculum, and I will work towards introducing that.","The creation of NIT has ensured some seats for admission in undergraduate courses for students of Arunachal Pradesh, which will bound to uplift economics of locality directly or indirectly and help in enhancing human development index in the state.","The mid-day meal is a well-intentioned scheme and has to be implemented effectively.","It is a fantastic initiative by the ministry to develop Aakash Tablet, a mobile device that can be utilised by students anywhere. It was successfully tried out. The second and third versions have come out and the fourth version is on the anvil.","Public-Private Partnership in financing, service delivery and provision of workspaces and training of trainers must be promoted to meet the demand and supply gap in the field of skill development.","We are in a democracy, and I think for all issues, whatever matters that the opposition may have apprehension on, there is a forum, and it is called Parliament.","Foreign universities have two aspects - content and brand. If we focus on the brand, we could lose out on the content. The idea is to focus on the content.","There is definitely a need for increasing capacity in higher education; a large part of this is being met in the technical education segment by the private sector and in the non-technical by the state sector. In the public sector, we will do whatever we can afford.","I don't believe that someone who sets up an institution should be able to take out the money from the institution or pay dividends to shareholders. I am not saying that institutions should be set up for charity.","Industry and institutes need to build smarter linkages.","Recognising that the future growth of India will depend on greater skill development, the National Policy for Skill Development aims to create a skilled workforce of 500 million by 2022."],"Palmer Luckey":["Any real virtual reality enthusiast can look back at VR science fiction. It's not about playing games... 'The Matrix,' 'Snow Crash,' all this fiction was not about sitting in a room playing video games. It's about being in a parallel digital world that exists alongside our own, communicating with other people, playing with other people.","Once you have perfect virtual reality, what else are you supposed to perfect?","VR is going to be defined by the content that is designed explicitly for virtual reality.","Virtual reality is inevitably going to become mainstream - it's only a question of how good it needs to be before the mainstream is willing to use it.","In the past, before phones and the Internet, all communication was face-to-face. Now, most of it is digital, via emails and messaging services. If people were to start using virtual reality, it would almost come full circle.","There are times, especially when I was just getting into PC gaming, where I spent way less time playing than obsessing about the quality of the play.","Focus comes a lot more easily when you desperately want the results of your own work - nobody else is going to do it for you.","I'm a huge gamer. I'm very excited, and the idea of the Rift was as a headset that was designed around the specific uses of VR gaming. But I'm excited about a lot of stuff that's outside of it, because I was a VR enthusiast. I want VR to be the thing that we all live in, that we all use for everything, not just games.","The Arab Spring is kind of a perfect model for how people are going to use technology to act collectively in their own interest in the future. There's never been a revolution that was coordinated by social media to the degree that the Arab Spring was.","Don't be afraid to convince yourself that your business is incredible, but don't expect others to be convinced without solid data to back it up. Ideas can be a worth a lot, but they are usually not. Execution is everything.","If you have perfect virtual reality eventually, where you're be able to simulate everything that a human can experience or imagine experiencing, it's hard to imagine where you go from there.","I'm really familiar with what Cardboard's doing; it's not a novel concept. Cardboard is in many ways a direct ripoff of FOV2GO, a project I helped work on when I was at ICT, and it was fairly well known in the academic VR community.","I was interested in virtual reality for several years even before working at USC, it wasn't an interest that started there at all. In fact, when I started working at USC, I already had prototypes of the Rift that were very similar to the final design.","I started attending community college when I was 14 or 15, just doing general education stuff like history and mathematics. Then I went on to California State University Long Beach to pursue a degree in journalism. And then I ended up dropping out to found Oculus.","I don't think that technology is going to allow for greater subjugation of people. I think it's gonna give them more freedom.","The whole thing with VR is that it doesn't matter, local versus networked gaming. The goal in virtual reality isn't to have people sit in the same room with headsets on.","I'm the most optimistic guy about VR out there. I have crazy visions of what we'll be doing in the future.","Ever since I was 15, I've tried to act and talk as if I was a public figure because I was sure that I would be one day and wanted to be prepared.","If I grew up in 'da hood,' it would make my story so much more interesting - if I had something to escape from. I had a pretty good life. My parents weren't rich; they weren't poor. I wasn't trying to escape from anything. It was always just the pursuit of something cooler.","I've been a bit of an electronics enthusiast and maker for a long time. I actually started the forum called ModRetro. It's an electronics enthusiast community that focuses on modifying vintage game consoles, and it's actually one of the larger game console modification forums on the Internet.","I'm a huge fan of online communities. I think that asynchronous internet-based communication forums such as Reddit and other discussion forums are one of the best things that could possibly have happened to collaborative invention. The Rift certainly would not exist without forums.","A lot of people, even if they know what VR is, see it as this tool to go in your basement and play Halo.","Games take years to make, and it's important that when we launch, it can't just be a great launch catalog and then a desert for a really long time. To be honest, for a lot of developers, they'd rather not be competing at launch with all this other software.","Virtual reality is a tough sell for a software developer. They have to convince investors that not only are they going to build a good game, which is what they normally have to do, they have to convince them that it's going to be a good game and that virtual reality will be successful.","I think probably the majority of political actions don't go the way people are going to go. Just because there were unexpected consequences and maybe not the resolution people would have liked to have been seen doesn't mean it was less valid of an action.","When you have more people investing in VR games, whether it's us or Sony or someone else, that means a greater pool of VR developers out there who know how to make VR games.","It's going to be so obvious when something isn't well made for VR. People are going to use the best VR content. That's the stuff that's going to get shown to people. That's the stuff that's going to get demoed. That's most of what people are going to buy.","The Oculus Studio stuff is going to remain exclusive to the Oculus store and platform. That's not to say that you'll never be able to play it on other hardware, but it very much is exclusive to the Oculus platform.","I don't think that VR is going to lead to humanity being enslaved in the matrix or letting the world crumble around us. I think it's going to end up being a great technology that brings closer people together, that allows for better communication, that reduces a lot of environmental waste that we're currently doing in the real world.","If you're having a very high-adrenaline, high-movement experience in virtual reality, and then all of a sudden you're back in your office, that disconnect is pretty notable. Whereas if you're using it for virtual reality teleconferencing... there's really no kind of impact moving back and forth between the real and the virtual world.","VR is going to become something mainstream, but it's not going to happen right away. You just don't have the horsepower to make it happen on a device, much less a cheap enough and comfortable enough device that a normal consumer is going to want to have.","As a PC gaming enthusiast, a significant chunk of my time and money was spent building and upgrading my rig, always in pursuit of a better gaming experience. At some point, I decided to take a look past my three 3D monitors and figure out what the absolute best theoretical gaming setup would be.","I wanted to play games in the best way possible, a way that was better than anyone else would have access to. As time went on, it became clear that VR was actually feasible on a large scale at a low cost, and at a quality far beyond what I had been hoping for."],"Paloma Elsesser":["Beauty means expression and being your most authentic self.","I'm happy to sparkle like a glazed disco ball.","I like looking wet, sweaty, dewy, fresh.","I think self-love isn't some destination you get to and you are then incapable of feeling those feelings, but a journey in which you adapt your experiences to make for a happier life.","Growing up, people would always say, 'You have such a pretty face.' It's kind of backhanded. That's the kind of things we have to stomach.","For makeup, I swear by a base of Embryolisse, Nars concealer, that Bobbie Brown foundation stick, Pat's highlighter, a brow fill-in with dark brown eyeshadow and angle brush, a groom with Anastasia brow gel, an eyelash curl, and two swipes of drugstore mascara.","A huge part of my career and how I want to participate in the world is being unapologetically myself and being honest and vulnerable.","At times, the curve/fat/plus convo tends be this 'out of the dark' story, like, 'I used to be insecure, but now here I am.' But that is not my reality, and for most of the people, that isn't their reality, either.","Embrace the grease, if any, and look fresh and human. I like to look like a glazed doughnut.","You don't want to be too hot in the club. And ambience is important - no fog machines.","I die wearing a bootie for three hours. I'm like, get these off of me!","I had seen images of Crystal Renn and Sophie Dahl growing up, but I didn't really know about the plus-size fashion industry or how lucrative it was or, like, that it was changing or that I was even invited.","When I started Instagram, I kind of just did what I like to do or to show the things I like, whether it be sneakers or weird flowers, have the little drops of myself and my style kind of fluidly throughout. That was really helpful in starting and carving out my own place.","I have to remind myself when I'm on a job and I'm feeling a lull in attitude or confidence or whatever, I'm there for a reason. I have to constantly remind myself of these almost corny Pinterest mantras, like 'You are worthy.'","It's really hard not to fall into that trap of insecurity when you're a model. Beforehand, I never looked at myself in a huge monitor with 30 people around it every day.","I think I felt pretty alienated, being bigger, being mixed race, being of lower socioeconomic standing.","It's important to see color. We are not the same. We have very different experiences.","It's not that that I'm not comfortable being naked, but when you grow up fat, you can't take away the shame or embarrassment even though you're a model. It's not just erased.","I hope that in 50 years I can look back and say I made my most fervent efforts to provide visibility for the unseen.","I am always dabbling in new skin routines, but it's always about moisture.","It's important for people to understand where things come or what they represent.","The International Girl Crew isn't supposed to be super exclusive - that's a really important part of our brand and message. It's not just our crew - it's a lifestyle. It's for everybody to know how empowering it is to be surrounded by friends who motivate and support you and who you feel like you can exchange ideas with and do projects with.","We have to tokenize in order to normalize.","I am trying to be the girl I didn't have. That's important to me. I have to be conscious of that. In this weird, dark, small, very intimate way, there's a girl out there who relies on me. And that's super important to me, and I don't want to let her down.","You're dealing with all these foreign agents, foreign brushes, and different time zones. So, you have to put just as much work into taking that makeup off as you do into putting it on.","The Internet really offered a space for me to thrive.","I wasn't scouted in the mall as a kid; it just kinda happened naturally 'cause of Instagram and New York and being visible, which is cool. Things just started rolling in. Timing was in my favour 'cause the Internet acted as a catalyst for the fashion industry to change and be more open 'cause people demanded it.","I remember going to the Gap when I was in the fifth grade, and I desperately wanted a pair of blue jeans. I was with my dad, and I remember picking up the jeans, looking at them, and thinking that they had to fit me. But there was nothing that fit me. This was before the age of stretch, so I was trying on adult Gap.","It's not fair for little kids to feel bad about themselves for how they look.","I went to private school my whole life. Growing up in Los Angeles, you're surrounded by not just Connecticut privilege but, like, your-dad's-a-movie-star privilege.","It took a lot for me to be able to say that I'm a plus-size model or a model at all without feeling terror or this kind of panic, because it was something so unplanned.","I originally went to school for writing, for non-fiction. I'm specifically a poetry major within literature, but I don't know.","The more and more I got into writing, the harder and harder it became for me. I still love it, but it became much more problematic than I thought it would be.","I went to small liberal schools my whole life, and I was also a bad girl in high school; I went to, like, five schools.","New York has influenced me a lot in terms of my own independence. I'm really struck by the idea of authenticity, and I think New York embodies that idea, even though people are like, 'I miss the old New York.' But at its core, it has this natural, authentic energy. L.A. lacks that idea; it's painted over.","I moved to New York for school right after I turned 18, but I started getting into trouble - so I went home to L.A. to regroup.","My version of makeup is a really intense skin regimen. I just think it's a healthier way to look at beauty.","Wearing too much makeup definitely makes my skin worse.","Having a multi-cultural background has granted me access into different ideologies, cultures, and ways of living. It has shaped who I am and how I participate in the world.","My parents are artists and have always instilled great pride in understanding of various backgrounds.","My parents always supported me and complimented me on other things, not just my looks. They told me I was capable, that I was smart, that I was creative."],"Paloma Faith":["Curvy is something to be proud of.","It's amazing living alone. I'm very lucky. It's like a refuge.","I wish I was more stupid because I'm either completely ecstatic and joyous and absolutely high as a kite or I'm a bit morbid. There's never anything in between.","I love interesting people with eccentric stories and outsiders of the world.","You feel a sense of elation seeing yourself on a billboard.","Adele's like a beacon of honesty. Doesn't compromise, goes to America and she's still the same sweary cockney.","Dressing up is like therapy; I feel better in myself when I've made an effort.","Once you accept that we're all imperfect, it's the most liberating thing in the world. Then you can go around making mistakes and saying the wrong thing and tripping over on the street and all that and not feel worried.","There's nothing better than achieving your goals, whatever they might be.","I design all my sets. With my tour and my album artwork, I co-design that with people who are better at drawing than me. But I've got a good imagination. I went to art school so I understand how to communicate my ideas.","There's nothing wrong with a thick eyebrow; Frida Kahlo had them.","I'm really into food; it's one of my favourite things - everything from potato waffles to lobster.","I'm under no illusion that there are things about me that I'd like to change. I just accept who I am, and I'm proud of it.","I feel quite fearless protecting the people I love.","You know, my mum's always encouraged me and never made my gender an issue, I guess. She brought me up to believe in equality, as opposed to feminism or sexism - so it just meant that my gender was not relevant to what I was capable of achieving.","I enjoy being a girl.","A lot of men do have a fear of my ultra-femininity. Sometimes people say I look like a drag queen, that I look scary, but I think that's a fear of my confidence. Most women in contemporary culture pare down their femininity, so there's a slight androgyny about them, and I think men have got used to seeing that.","I think everybody should focus on inner beauty.","I travel regularly and have learnt to be very methodical as far as packing is concerned. For example, I always check the weather in advance of where I'm going to ensure that I've packed the right clothes.","I don't feel I fit in with morning television because I'm like a vampire and I like to stay up late.","All the things that I find beautiful have a darkness about them.","My favourite authors are Milan Kundera and Jeanette Winterson.","I vote Labour and can't begin to acknowledge anything good that comes from a Tory.","I really hate bureaucracy and the idea that I'm not a free person.","When you're on the pop treadmill, you don't always feel that cool because you have to do things to promote the record that aren't necessarily your environment.","Compared to a lot of artists, I'm usually quite covered up in videos and photo shoots.","I'd rather be on my own than be with a violent man.","I'm not a downtrodden woman. I just won't be.","I'm not that materialistic. I like nice clothes and that, but I don't spend lots of money on stuff. I'm not really into TV, I don't have an iPod, I've got a gramophone.","Ever since I was little, my mum used to choose an outfit for me and lay it on the bed so I'd know what I was wearing the next day. I never went to a uniformed school, so I always had an outfit - and I never really grew out of that, I don't think.","I mean, my music career and my acting career - if I want to do them to the extent that I eventually do want to get to, it's going to be a bit of a balancing act. But I'm hoping they'll just go hand in hand.","If I see something that inspires me, I'll dress like it.","I've got so many clothes; I can dress in any style.","I'd never go on a reality show - it's too invasive.","I'm not interested in what other people are doing. That's their business.","Sometimes when you've got too much money you lose your imagination.","I just really want to make albums - and however I can, I will.","I love Andre 3000 from OutKast. I think we'd complement each other, but I'm hoping he's got a good sense of humour.","If I go out with no make-up and a tracksuit on, nobody comes up to me. And if they do, I won't do a photo because I wouldn't want any photographic evidence.","I think I'd be a million times more successful and more iconic if I was a singer in the '40s. I'd be allowed a level of mystery, and I think I'd suit that decade.","I was mainly raised by a working mum who didn't have much time or inclination for making food. So I had three or four basic meals: fish fingers and a tomato; a packet scotch egg and a tomato; pasta with a tin of tomatoes; and extra mild plastic-y cheddar chopped into cubes with bits of cucumber.","Mum doesn't like it when I mention that Dad's a better cook than her. He was born in Spain and spent eight years in Portugal and is exceptional at lots of cuisines.","I really like to please people, and I think it's a symptom of being an only child.","I was once in a long relationship with a man who ran a vintage clothes store but had been a chef, so I'd come home each night to a different three-course meal. I was quite fat, but so happy.","I think initially, the record industry struggled a lot with digital media because there are a lot of aspects to it that can potentially destroy our industry.","I'm not a pop act, churning stuff out really quickly. I find the music that arises from that style of working is distracted, not particularly profound.","I'm a serial monogamist.","I get plenty of, 'Is that song about me?' from men but I just tell them to get over themselves.","Real talent shines through regardless of how many others there are around you.","I have a lot of admiration for people who've been in relationships a long time, married for years.","Whatever you are, you have the right to get married.","I feel quite excited about the possibility of working on multiple albums. There's something really iconic about having a catalog featuring a lot of albums, and I'd love to have that legacy.","Anything that's on television as often as someone on 'The X Factor' is what's successful. That doesn't mean that I condone that or think that it's right. To be honest, I'd be the first to say I think it's a shame. But if that's the way it is then that's the way it is.","I don't have a competitive bone in my body, so the last thing I want to do is be competing with people.","I think what makes me different from the average Joe is that I feel free to be myself and express myself in the way that I want. If that makes you mad, we're living in a world of dire straits. If anything, it makes you more sane.","It's tragic that you can define a whole movement in music by gender alone. People are like, 'Oh, look, another quirky girl.'","Cinema affects everything, from the way I get dressed to how I build my stages.","I want my shows to be eerie and mysterious.","All creative people have to have vulnerability because those nuances are what move people. So I'm deeply insecure - but I'm good at hiding it.","I'd rather die than let somebody get the better of me.","You cannot schedule death.","We all get old, but I always say the skinny, pretty girls will be screwed.","I don't understand why the accent you speak in has to indicate what level of intellect you have.","Celebrity culture is an aspirational culture regardless of how much you don't want it to be.","We live in a society where everything's packaged.","I agree with cosmetic surgery for medical reasons - my mother had breast cancer and I think it's very sad when somebody has no choice in what happens to their body.","I wasn't really comfortable reading until I was 12.","My mum's always on at me to have children and blames 'that stupid stage thing you do' for me not already having a family.","I just have an inability to lie.","I'd love to say that I could write political songs, but I don't feel clued-up enough.","I don't know anyone, from any class, who's had a perfectly easy life. I've met people born into wealthy families who feel like they didn't have much emotional support, and people who come from working-class families who had loads of love but no money.","Working with Terry Gilliam was magic - I've been watching his films since I was little.","I'm proud of being British, but I think our aristocracy is overrated.","I like sparkles; I think I'm a magpie.","I'd say that, first and foremost, I'm a performer; I started performing when I was four years old, and being on stage from a young age set me up.","I'm not one for sightseeing or going around the shops when I'm on holiday. I do enough shopping when I'm at home, and like to have a complete break when I'm away.","I don't normally have time to read, so when I go away I like to take a few books.","I feel curious about every situation I'm in.","My mum came from nothing and didn't have many opportunities in her youth, and she blames a lot of her social inadequacies on that.","When I do my shows, it's really cross-generational. Sometimes there's three generations there.","I love going to the cinema. Whenever I get time off, that's where I go.","I try not to brand myself 'weird' any more because it sticks.","When you research prolific songwriters, it is usually later in their career they write songs that they distance themselves from, or it's about other people.","I go running three times a week - outside in the park, come rain or shine, and I hate every moment of it. I hate everything about it. But I know it's important for health reasons and the reason why I run, in particular, is because my stage work is like cardiovascular work so I don't want to lose my breath on stage.","I dread the idea of a paparazzi snapping me while I'm out running.","I try to stick to a certain diet all the time, and then when I feel like a reward, I have it. I try to stick to no dairy, no sugar, no wheat.","I don't have a daily routine, beyond brushing my teeth. It changes every day.","Some men think that if you're empowered and sure of yourself then you're a man-hater, but it's like, 'No, I'm just the same as you are, but maybe just a tiny bit more confident.'","I'm so used to changing time zones that I can sleep at any time. I'm rarely ever tossing and turning - if I am, it's really a big deal.","I lend people money, but I'd never lend something that would jeopardise a friendship if I didn't get it back.","I'm the type of person who, if somebody offers me a free meal, I get excited because you never know where your next free meal is going to come from.","The freedom that money gives you makes you... well, I wouldn't say happy, but I'd say it gives you diversity.","I use debit cards for everyday purchases, as I don't believe in credit cards. But this has caused problems, especially with American touring, because I refuse to have a credit card - and in America you can't pay for anything on a debit card.","I don't overthink when I'm styling. I kind of forgive myself and accept that I will make mistakes. Getting dressed should be a fun experience!","I get to know my regular fans, and they inspire me.","Anybody who says they don't want to be seen on a show which has millions of people watching it at one time when they're in the business of selling records is a bit silly.","I've spent a lot of time being bohemian and sleeping on floors, but eventually I want to have kids and I want to bring them up in a secure environment.","If I get in a relationship, it's always for the long-term; if not, I don't see the point.","I am inspired by show girls and Vegas. I was a cabaret performer, so that's where all that influence comes from.","I stay true to my lyrics. If I go back and look at them in hindsight, the emotions I had when I wrote them have passed. It feels unjustified to change them.","I'm very affected by what I watch and read.","Sometimes people fear the truth. They'd rather not speak to you than know what you really think.","I don't connect much with the present. I have more of an affinity for what came in the past.","I think soul is soul. I don't see new soul as any different to old soul."],"Paloma Picasso":["I don't have anything to prove anymore. I can relax.","Personal style is not something that is just in the air. It is something you have and that you apply to yourself.","Because I was so quiet, my father let me spend hours and hours next to him while he would sketch. Everyone else was always asking things from him. I wasn't asking anything. I was just happy to be there.","I think, aesthetically, car design is so interesting - the dashboards, the steering wheels, and the beauty of the mechanics. I don't know how any of it works, I don't want to know, but it's inspirational.","I decided to do everything around fashion but fashion itself, and that's accessories.","Nothing in the world can be more exciting than to create something and see it work.","We are all familiar with the dove carrying an olive branch as a peace offering. The jewelry I've created pays tribute both to the messenger's noble mission and gardens as a refuge of peace and tranquility.","Fashion should be playful.","I've heard my work called 'bold' and 'graffiti-like,' but for me it is always instinctual. I start with a shape or a colour and go from there.","Sometimes I get very dressed up just to go to the corner for some bread; I dress for my own amusement.","I've always been proud that my name stands for peace.","I always thought that you breathe, you eat, you go to sleep, and you draw.","I have always been interested in design, but in the beginning I didn't set out to make jewelry specifically.","After university, I was working as a stylist in the Paris theatres when I had a flash of inspiration. I made necklaces from the bikinis designed for the cabaret performers of Folies Bergeres. I was so happy with them that it was only then that I sought out formal training in jewelry.","The more famous you become, the less people will tell you your faults.","People say, 'Oh, to be the daughter of Picasso!' But it's not as extravagant as it seems. He was very special, very vibrant, but he was my father. I didn't have another."],"Pam Bondi":["Let's just focus on unity and love.","I love girl power.","There is simply no room for racial, hurtful language spoken to your colleagues or anyone else.","Despite the vigorous policy and legal debates surrounding same-sex marriage, there is little disagreement about this: If the United States Supreme Court holds that states must sanction same-sex marriage, then Florida's contrary laws must fall.","The American people are frustrated.","The only people that should vote should be legal.","Running for attorney general troubled me. Because I was worried I would simply become just a figurehead and that's not me.","All I want to do is be the best attorney general that I can be.","I think the future takes care of itself.","Will I support our president, whoever that might be? Absolutely. Did I vote for Donald Trump? Absolutely.","We need clarification regarding the death penalty. It's different in many states... It's a bit different throughout the country, so I look forward to Judge Gorsuch being on the court, Justice Gorsuch being on the court, and bringing some clarification to those issues.","I believe in forgiveness.","I never said I don't like gay people.","Anyone who attacks our LGBT community, anyone who attacks anyone in our state, will be gone after with the full extent of the law.","What women care about are jobs, the economy, the unemployment rate.","No access to me, nor my staff, will ever affect what we do to protect consumers of the state of Florida.","I do not want to be sheriff of Hillsborough County, seriously.","I'm proud to be among a bipartisan group of state attorneys general who consistently advocate against government infringement of Americans' Second Amendment rights.","I've done so many commencement speeches at colleges and law schools, and I tell young women that there are no glass ceilings because those were broken by a lot of women who came before us. You can be anyone you want to be. You can do anything you want to do.","If I get asked to talk to a group of CEOs or a group of high school students, I pick high school students.","You see a Donald Trump on TV, just like you'd see Joan Rivers on TV when she was living, and you see a real person. That's the Donald Trump that I know.","I will not be collateral damage in a presidential campaign, nor will I be a woman bullied by Hillary Clinton.","We will do everything within our power to protect Floridians from unlawful debt collection practices that often employ scare tactics to manipulate individuals.","Historically, there has been a clear and essential connection between marriage and responsible procreation and child rearing.","All I'm going to say is I put my hand on a Bible, and I raised my right hand and swore to uphold the Constitution of the state of Florida.","I have many, many gay friends.","I don't believe I should be out running for another office instead of running my office.","I will never let money from anyone affect what I do.","I'm proud of my office. I'm proud of the work that we do.","I would never, ever trade any campaign donation - that's absurd - for some type of favor to anyone.","I'm very happy being attorney general.","I'd never discuss anything confidential.","That job should not be a political job. We should not be hearing very publicly from the leader of the FBI.","The promotion of family continuity and stability is a legitimate state interest.","I can only focus on doing what's right.","Businesses across the country are raising their prices in order to compensate for their added costs due to Obama's health care plan. If they aren't raising prices, they're cutting jobs as a result of the added cost, both of which hurt our economy."],"Pam Brown":["A horse is the projection of peoples' dreams about themselves - strong, powerful, beautiful - and it has the capability of giving us escape from our mundane existence.","Kittens are wide-eyed, soft and sweet. With needles in their jaws and feet.","For every person who has ever lived there has come, at last, a spring he will never see. Glory then in the springs that are yours.","One small cat changes coming home to an empty house to coming home.","Odd how much it hurts when a friend moves away- and leaves behind only silence.","The courage of very ordinary people is all that stands between us and the dark.","A friendship can weather most things and thrive in thin soil; but it needs a little mulch of letters and phone calls and small, silly presents every so often - just to save it from drying out completely.","A cat can maintain a position of curled up somnolence on your knee until you are nearly upright. To the last minute she hopes your conscience will get the better of you and you will settle down again.","If your sister is in a tearing hurry to go out and cannot catch your eye, she's wearing your best sweater."],"Pam Dawber":["I've worked very hard at understanding myself, learning to be assertive. I'm past the point where I worry about people liking me.","I'm not a comedienne. I'm an actress.","I've always been quite a happy person, but when I'm low, I'm pretty darn low.","I was never the girl in high school who had a boyfriend for years. My longest relationship has been 18 months. I've thought maybe I'm really superficial and unable to have a relationship. What I've found is that people are attracted by my independence, and then they try to squelch it.","I need to end up with someone who is strong, intelligent, independent, someone I really admire - sensitive, sensuous, warm, a sense of humor.","I love to sing more than anything - more than acting, even.","I guess I don't believe that death is the end."],"Pam Ferris":["Girls shouldn't throw away their lives. They have the opportunity to not have 25 children - to make something of themselves, and use their brains and creativity. I'm just thrilled about that.","I don't get self-conscious. I'm not vain in that way.","I think I would have had trouble living with someone who didn't know what it was like to be an actor.","Some people find that if they share a profession with their partner, they don't talk about anything else.","Grief is a terrible, painful place. You can't grind away on grief in a solid way and say, 'I'm going to work on this until it's over' because it will be with you for the rest of your life, whatever you do. So, you deal with it and move on.","I'm a professional actor, not a celebrity.","I think fractures in your childhood make you observe the world more as an outsider. Possibly it pushes you outside.","My dad died when he was 60. I was only 17 and I think, psychologically, that had a huge impact on me, probably more than I realised.","I was obsessed with work in my youth. It's why I didn't get married until I was 38 and the reason I didn't have kids.","The older I get, the less I know. By that I mean the less I am sure of. I view people with strong opinions on the big stuff with distrust. I don't think we should have certain certainties on faith and politics; I think we should be open-minded."],"Pam Gems":["I begin to perceive that I am a woman. What that is, heaven knows... the philosophy is yet to be written, there is a world to be explored.","I am at war... with the principal personage of traditional philosophy, that abstract subject who masquerades as everyone and anyone, but is really a male subject in disguise.","I wrote my first play when I was eight.","Olivier said that drama is an affair of the heart, or it's nothing, and he was right."],"Pam Grier":["That's what he was saying, the civil rights movement - judge me for my character, not how black my skin is, not how yellow my skin is, how short I am, how tall or fat or thin; It's by my character.","Women are allowed more freedoms and we're fighting for more freedoms, we're experiencing more freedoms won.","Me, sexy? I'm just plain ol' beans and rice.","The first movie that I saw was Godzilla and I loved it.","It's always fun to put on bell bottoms and have your butt hanging out and hip huggers.","My people were homesteading in Colorado before Emancipation.","You can be on top of everything, and the next minute, you're going to be on the bottom.","This whole beauty thing is something I've never comprehended.","Each time you do a film you gain a lot of experience and build a visual resume where people get to know who you are.","I grew up in a family where we weren't allowed to talk about beauty or to put any emphasis on physical appearance.","Well, thank you and that's for them, but for me, I want to look back at a body of work where when you do the research and you explore the psyche of a character, where she's been, where she is and where she's going.","It makes me forget that I'm not going to be a major star and lead female in films whether it was 20 years ago, 10 years ago, five or in the future.","There are just certain realities about our world and I just happen to be creative within it.","Driving a cab is not really a nurturing type of relationship. You take people and they tip you, they may not tip you, you don't know their names, they don't care about you, you don't care about them.","But I just loved looking at the clothes of the '70s.","I do a movie once every four years and they call it a comeback.","I've never considered myself to be beautiful, and I still don't.","I love science fiction.","I like to do all kinds of films.","I like serious films, the moneymaking blockbusters that don't make any kind of sense and John Carpenter films.","I don't believe that I should just do A-movies, I just do the work as an artist.","I love working with a lot of different films and a lot of different people.","I don't know how I did it, but I worked 7 days a week.","I thought I would be Sheena of the Jungle as a little girl.","I really do not care if it is a B-movie or not.","I love the hip-hop nation.","I came from poverty and was part of those circumstances.","Today, many people are engaging in same sex relationships and saying they are not gay.","My family was very, very receptive to all; all races, religions.","I'm an Air force Brat and I've lived all over the world and this country and there were people in my community who were gay - nurses, hairdressers, designers - people who just had a different way about themselves.","Oh, there's going to be debate because you're dealing with the Bible and religion is supposed to be separate from state and that to me is already a conflict before it even hits the gay issue.","Well who's black and what is a black person?","Does a black person make them an African American? No. There are Hispanics that are very, very dark skinned so the word has lost its meaning, it's not a very concise or proper word to use even today and it wasn't then.","I am really blessed and very grateful for it.","And as I reinvent myself and I'm constantly curious about everything, I can't wait to see what's around the corner in newfound art and entertainment and exploration."],"Pamela Adlon":["I want to elevate the mundane.","Being a mother is the ultimate training ground for anything.","One of the things I learned in animation is that you never, ever want to start doing a voice that you can't sustain for four straight hours.","My roles in the '80s were, like, gender dysphoric. I wasn't pretty, I wasn't this, I wasn't that. And I am kind of butchy, you know. That's just my thing.","I took my daughters to see Plastic Ono Band at the Orpheum in L.A. in 2012. It was an amazing experience because she is such a revolutionary artist. Everybody was like, 'Oh, it's Yoko, it's such a joke.' But it's no joke what she did, visually and musically. It's incredible.","I don't think I have a demographic. I was at Comic-Con in San Diego recently, and I was doing a signing, and my line was all military guys, young girls, housewives and guys in wheelchairs. There was just everybody all over the place.","The thing about women playing boys is that we're not going to age, and we're not going to go through puberty in the middle of a long-running series.","You can't regulate what these kids are being exposed to on the Internet. It's so way out of control. All you can do is just try to talk to your own kids.","I went from buying my own condominium and a car for myself when I was 17 on 'The Facts of Life' to not being able to pay my rent. I was at the unemployment office all the time. I had to sell my record collection just to make ends meet. And then I started getting these voice-over jobs.","Before 'Lucky Louie,' nobody would ever cast me to play a mom or a wife; nobody ever saw me in that role, which is weird, since that's who I really am.","Everybody hates you when you're the best, and everybody hates you when you're the worst.","I like people to have their own reaction and their own take on things. And I don't like to shove my - what I want them to feel or think - down their throats. I like people to say, 'What was that about?' or 'Why did that happen?' And so, any reactions are welcome.","I try to direct myself the way I direct the other actors who come on my show.","I just like to keep things small and subtle and authentic, and ground everything in reality. So that is something that I feel is my strength as a director and I try to achieve as an actor.","I can't imagine bringing in somebody else to direct my show. Wouldn't that be funny, if next season I had, like, Michael Bay come in and direct 'Better Things'? I wonder what that would be like?","You've gotta leave enough space for your actors to bring stuff to the table and whatever the weather's doing that day or what the light's like. Things can shift, and you have to be malleable. Every day is a different feeling and a change.","I'm very influenced by documentary filmmaking and independent filmmaking, by a lot of noir and films from the '40s. Those are my favorite. And then, filmmaking from the '70s is a big influence for me.","If I'm doing a voice-over session, like animation or something, and I'm doing three different voices, you've gotta separate them. You've gotta find the different places and do your different things.","'Roseanne' was massive for me. I adored that show. I mean, the show was this couple who weren't cookie-cutter, and they were sexy, and we know that they like to have sex with each other, and they flirted, and then they ragged on their kids, and their kids ragged on them, and it was such a realistic depiction.","The first thing that I ever made was a documentary that I shot... in downtown L.A. about a group of homeless people.","I am a single mom of three girls, and I'm getting through that. If I can get through that, I can direct a whole season of television that I star in.","Sometimes when I'm in the car driving, I scream at the top of my lungs.","You can go in and out of love and still love somebody, you know? You may not like them so much on the day, but I can tell you that I don't think I've ever been so vulnerable or been so angry in my life - like, those two emotions feel so hurt or so enraged - as when you're dealing with your kids.","There's something in my voice tonally that's like a boy, so I started being able to do boy voices and to be known as having a naturalistic boy tone without pushing it.","They would call me 'The Cleaner' because I would replace boys who were real adolescents, and their voices completely changed, and they couldn't do the voices anymore.","My life is extraordinary because it's so normal, but it's so 'extra' for some reason.","I get up at 6 A.M., and sometimes I make lunch for my two youngest kids. Usually my oldest sleeps late, and I get my kids out the door to school. For years, it was me just doing all of that and then driving to a carpool or this or that.","Cooking is the best occupational therapy for me. And when I cook, everybody comes to eat. It's the greatest thing.","I'm trying to keep my days very efficient, and I keep my set really tight. Every single corner is active, and everybody gets to thrive in the job that they do. I don't waste people's time.","For me, running a set and directing has been the most rewarding thing of my life and a happy surprise, because it was never really on my radar.","I've been working since I'm 9 years old.","I always tell young people when I'm trying to encourage them, 'You have certain windows in your life, and you have to take advantage of it. You gotta jump through because they will shut on you.'","I'm more of somebody who'll bend over backwards for people and, you know, wait at the back of the line until everybody's taken care of. That's really my nature.","It's spelled, like, S-E-R-G. I always thought it would be funny if I called my son 'Sir.' Like calling your daughter 'Ma'am,' or something like that.","It's a hilarious part of my past, all the sitcoms I did in the '80s. And then all the animation - animation is amazing. It's really been great.","I'm somebody who, if I went to the grocery store, and one of them wasn't with me, I would feel guilty. I would be like, 'I shouldn't be doing anything without them, anytime, ever.' A very codependent way of thinking. Also, motherhood is hugely about guilt.","I don't usually say 'working mom' because I think all moms are working moms. I feel like that diminishes moms. People should say 'working dad' as opposed to working moms.","I learned so much from my life as an actor, as a kid actor through being an adult actor, and then becoming a writer and producer and doing animation.","I learned so much from the writing on 'King of the Hill', which I thought was just magnificent. They would let real moments happen in this animated, one-dimensional world. I feel like I've been in school this whole time.","When I saw 'Louie' and 'Girls', I was blown out of the water. They were fearless portrayals of real life. Everyone has a different experience.","I've always been interested in how other people live their lives, which is why it's important to engage fully even in painful times. And out of that, I get to laugh.","I've always been kind of a mom. I was out of my house when I was 18, and my friends used to call me 'mother' and 'care unit.'","Everything that happens to me in a day enhances my parenting.","I love that, 'mommy-shaming.' When I was a new mom, I was obsessed with how I was being perceived and trying to fit in as a mom, going to mommy-and-me classes and things like that, and never quite measuring up to 'the real moms,' the 'robot moms,' as I called them.","I think, over the years, the way my daughters' friends have embraced me has definitely made my daughters appreciate me more. Of course they take me for granted because I'm the one who's there, but listen, I don't want to be 'the cool mom' who lets things get out of control.That's not my lookout.","I want to be a strong, safe mom who my kids also want to be around.","I never want to waste a frame. I always look and see what I've got.","Sometimes when I'm in the editing room and there's a new person there, like a music editor or a post person that I don't really know, I'm like, 'Oh, you shouldn't be in here. This is too personal - you can't watch this.' But then I'm like, hey dummy, you're about to show this to the whole world.","I want to create opportunities for women, of course.","I don't like to let people know where I'm going to end up, and I don't personally like to know where I'm going.","Literally, FX is like, 'How can we foster your vision?' My vision is pretty much taking pictures of the way I see my life.","When you hit your 40s, you're walking around, and you realize, 'Oh, my God, men don't look at me anymore.' Or sometimes you can feel really good, and then you look in the mirror, and you're like, 'Oh, Jesus, that's my face now!' But I have tell you that something happened and shifted inside of me.","Wouldn't it be funny if I were a total nightmare? If I just shot 21-hour days and went over budget? But, you know, it's something I'm really careful about, because I am a mom, and also, I'm an actor. I'm a pleaser: I don't want to take up too much of people's time.","The only people on this planet that can make me feel like my feelings are hurt are my kids.","I've been adapting ever since my oldest had her first play date with a boy, and I was like, 'That's not normal,' because I came from the old school. Now boys sleep over at my house. It doesn't matter which girl, which age."],"Pamela Anderson":["I am what I am and I'm a horrible liar. I can't do it. I'm just very candid.","Tattoos are like stories - they're symbolic of the important moments in your life. Sitting down, talking about where you got each tattoo and what it symbolizes, is really beautiful.","Natural beauty takes at least two hours in front of a mirror.","I feel... sexier, I think, with short hair. I feel like an alien!","My hair was so much a part of my personality and all my photo shoots. I hid behind my hair. And then, I just decided I was okay with myself. To have short hair and really show my face is even more revealing than anything. It's a statement - not to everyone else, more to myself. I'm just ready to get out from behind my hair and be myself.","It's great to be a blonde. With low expectations it's very easy to surprise people.","Like I said, everybody has got something they have to deal with health-wise, and everybody's human. I should look after myself better, but so should everybody, right?","I did five seasons of 'Baywatch,' and I did four seasons of 'VIP.' I've been around awhile.","I'm kind of proud of myself. I've been able to keep a certain grace about me, even in the times of disgrace and craziness.","People who wear fur smell like a wet dog if they're in the rain. And they look fat and gross.","I want Barack Obama for president. I love Obama. I call Palin the helicopter huntress from hell! I want my children to have a wonderful future, and it's disturbing when I look around. Americans aren't very well-liked. A likable president would be a great start.","There's never going to be a great misunderstanding of me. I think I'm a little whacked.","I like to do everything myself - I'm very hands-on with my housekeeping, my children, travelling, how I do things.","I'm a soccer mom. I'm T-ball, soccer, karate, homework, keeping them on their schedules. I love being the snack mom, when I get to bring the cut oranges. I have one of those coolers with wheels. I'm at every game, every practice, sitting on my blanket. I love it.","In order for a man to feel whole, he needs someone to look up to and someone to look up to him.","I'm a mother with two small children, so I don't take as much crap as I used to.","Making love in the morning got me through morning sickness. I found I could be happy and throw up at the same time.","Eventually you just have to realize that you're living for an audience of one. I'm not here for anyone else's approval.","I've had lots of things that didn't work out, like TV shows. You learn a lot through mistakes - I learned that you have to be the captain of your ship. Actually, I own my ship.","I look back on the last 10 years and I have to say I'm proud of what I have accomplished, because I've been able to raise two beautiful children.","I do a lot for PETA. I do a lot of things I think are really important, I volunteer at school and I'm still amazed I can pay my bills because I feel like I don't work that much, I really don't.","My career only took off because of one football game. I thought it was funny. 'Playboy' called and offered me a cover just like that. I turned them down initially, because I was nervous about it and my boyfriend at the time didn't want me to do it, but they kept coming back, so I eventually said yes.","It's going to take a certain man for me to ever get involved with, because he'll have to realize I don't have two children, I have three. Tommy is always going to always be a part of my life.","My ideal relaxation is working on upholstry. I spend hours in junk shops buying furniture. I do all the upholstery work myself, and it's like therapy.","There's no way I set out to be a certain kind of symbol - the way I dress is the way I am, the way I live my life.","I have this phobia: I don't like mirrors. And I don't watch myself on television. If anything comes on, I make them shut it off, or I leave the room.","I don't really think about anything too much. I live in the present. I move on. I don't think about what happened yesterday.","And I'm not an actress. I don't think I am an actress. I think I've created a brand and a business.","If people knew how KFC treats its chickens, they'd never eat another drumstick.","The bust of Colonel Sanders stands as a monument to cruelty and has no place in the Kentucky state Capitol.","The true meaning of feminism is this: to use your strong womanly image to gain strong results in society.","People always tell me, 'Reinvent yourself, re-this, re-whatever.' I haven't reinvented myself. It's an honest evolution. I've always been authentic.","I'm known for my handwritten notes.","I'm never away from my boys for more than three days.","My little circle of friends know how twisted my brain is. I'm constantly reading and people always think, 'Ah, we didn't know that about you', but that's part of my charm.","I am turning into the person I knew I would.","I have to think of moderation, which is not a word that's in my vocabulary. But I try.","Basically, I'm a free spirit. I'm kind of an Everywoman.","My dad read the Bible ten times, and I want to do it in my lifetime. But it's definitely tough getting through.","I have my hands full with my kids and so romance is not high on my list of priorities.","I was never an ambitious girl, or even a self-confident one. I never went in for beauty pageants or wore a stitch of make-up until I went to Los Angeles.","I don't think I am an actress. I think I've created a brand and a business.","My father is a great grandfather. He's a wonderful grandfather, but he's a terrible husband.","I've created my own career in my life, and I've had a lot of fun doing it. I think that's good.","Confining marine animals to tanks and separating them from their families and their natural surroundings, just so people can watch them swim in endless circles, teaches us far more about humans than it does about animals - and the lesson is not a flattering one.","I'm an immigrant myself. It was a tough road to come to America and work.","I don't wear sunscreen. I don't have a skincare program.","I want to see what I look like when I'm old - I'm curious where that's going to take me.","I like to work and it kind of keeps me in line, which is very good because I need that structure.","I feel that, at this point in my career, I don't want to do another television show. I don't want to do a film.","Being halfway through my life, I think we start feeling less invincible and we start thinking more about the important things.","I have two homes in Malibu, a home in Canada that I'm building, and I just love pouring my heart out into this part of my life.","I've been married a couple of times and survived!","I don't do the gym and I don't diet. I'm vegetarian but I don't diet.","I am the ultimate California girl, which is funny, being that I'm Canadian.","I don't know if women are meant to run, especially after having kids.","I have a Stella McCartney Adidas sports bra. I feel like I'm totally comfortable running. No problem. I have support where I need it.","Oh God, I don't know if I ever really felt beautiful. I don't, really.","I thought, 'If you're going to be on TV, and if you're going to be out and glamorous, the natural look can stay at home.'","You grow up and change your look. I feel different from how I did in my Playboy days. Now I think I'm in charge of toning down my look or not.","Even as a kid, I read 'Jung - Reflections and Individuation In Fairy Tales'; all the inner circle of Jung was a real huge thing for me.","I was getting a little bored with my hair. It's kind of a symbolic thing, just getting rid of the past, moving forward. It's amazing what a reaction you get when you cut your hair.","It's very liberating to cut your hair.","I started running, and I hated it. Of course, everyone hates running for the first mile. If you're running two miles or twenty miles, it always hurts. Now I live it. I look forward to it. It's really good. It clears my head.","I'm a complete romantic - it's why I always get married. Someone should really stop me.","I hate remakes of TV shows - I didn't like the new Charlie's Angels at all - and I just don't see the point of going back and doing the same thing over again. Baywatch was fun and successful, probably because we didn't know what the heck we were doing.","I was a gymnast when I was little, like 8, 9, 10.","I don't look at the tabloids. I don't read the tabloids.","My refrigerator is full of kale and greens. I can't imagine something greasy, or eating meat.","Good Viking genes, being vegetarian and having rowdy dogs and kids definitely keep me in shape. Not eating meat gives me the energy I need to keep up with work, family and travel - I'm very active.","I'm a good example of someone who can come to Hollywood and keep their feet on the ground with all the rock stars, all the drama that goes with being here. It's still important to pump your own gas and to be able to vacuum.","I don't consider myself a feminist, but I feel very empowered as a woman, and I've used all my resources widely. I believe in equality, but that's just naturally happening. I still want a door opened for me, to be treated like a lady, but I also want equal rights for women, of course.","It's nice to have boundaries, because as long as we have them, we can cross them a bit, and that's what perks interest. If you have full freedom, what do you do?"],"Pamela Dean":["I was a weird but definite kid, and there were essentially no gender roles for me to fit into.","I wholeheartedly rejected anything remotely feminine but was not enthusiastic about anything masculine, either. I did not want to cook and have babies, and I did not want to be an engineer or a baseball player or a soldier or a politician or any of the myriad careers open mostly or solely to men. I wanted to be a poet.","I did always think of Heinlein as a strict rationalist, although a dispassionate examination of his works doesn't support that.","Truthfully, the person with whom I identified most in Heinlein's early works was Rhysling in 'The Green Hills of Earth.'","I first read Heinlein when I was very young.","Just as I could tell you about my first Andre Norton novel or my first L'Engle or my first Asimov, I could write a paragraph about how each of these writers influenced me, my writing, and my thoughts, and do to this day."],"Pamela Hansford Johnson":["The sky broke like an egg into full sunset and the water caught fire.","Sainthood is acceptable only in saints.","You slam a politician, you make out he's the devil, with horns and hoofs. But his wife loves him, and so did all his mistresses.","Be fond of the man who jests at his scars, if you like; but never believe he is being on the level with you.","We demand that people should be true to the pictures we have of them, no matter how repulsive those pictures may be: we prefer the true portrait in all its homogeneity, to one with a detail added which refuses to fit in.","I hated the bangs in the war: I always felt a silent war would be more tolerable."],"Pamela Hanson":["I went to university in Colorado and studied art history. I did some photography classes there, although it felt really pretentious.","I hardly look at myself in the mirror... I'll only wear makeup if I need to cover something up. But I've recently started caring about my skin. I just turned 60 and was like, 'OK, maybe it's time to start thinking about it.' Before that, I would just splash water on my face, put cream on, and then leave.","I've had Botox. It hurts a lot, but I like it."],"Pamela Meyer":["Lying is a cooperative act. Think about it. A lie has no power whatsoever by its mere utterance. Its power emerges when someone else agrees to believe the lie.","For the liespotter who knows how to listen well, the random words, sounds, and phrases in a person's speech are never as random as they seem. They offer a clear sightline into the liar's psyche.","Liars do look you in the eye. They do not always stutter, stammer, blush or fidget.","Deception can cost billions. Think Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis. Or in the case of double agents and traitors, like Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames, lies can betray our country. They can compromise our security. They can undermine democracy. They can cause the deaths of those that defend us.","Nothing is certain in life but death and taxes. And in Donald Trump's case, lies.","Good liars are skilled at reading others well, putting them at ease, managing their own emotions, and intuitively sensing how others perceive them.","White lies keep social dignity intact and are far more prevalent than most people realize. Several studies have found that an average person is lied to from 10 to 200 times a day - mostly just to keep a conversation going, to avoid conflict, or to establish a connection with someone.","Tales of cheating on school and college tests are rife. There have been instances where teachers have given students test answers in order to make themselves look good on their performance reviews. Mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending a message that lying and cheating are acceptable.","Honest people remember stories in the order of emotional prominence, but liars will recount a story in chronological order. Memory rarely works that way.","Con men look for human frailty to exploit. This is most often greed. Trump found a different vice: anger. The emotional are always the most susceptible to manipulation.","One immutable trait of the gullible is that they are credulous to a fault. Though no-doubt well-meaning, the naive are Trump's base.","As someone who specializes in deception, I'll tell you this much: When someone insistently implores, 'Believe me,' don't. Pleading 'believe me' or 'trust me' - insisting to people that you are telling the truth - is a tell-tale sign that you probably aren't.","Trump is a master obfuscator. Like an octopus escaping a predator, he releases a cloud of ink when called to the carpet on one of his many lies. His strategy? Obfuscate, then reference others. 'Millions agree,' 'everyone knows,' 'many have done it.'","One-year-olds learn concealment. Five-year-olds lie outright: they manipulate via flattery. Nine-year-olds - masters of the cover-up. By the time you enter college, you're going to lie to your mom in one out of every five interactions.","When a pointed question is beaten back with an attack or threat of, 'How dare you...' it's a reliable signal that deception is involved. Trump is a master at this.","Research indicates that a pause tends to be a signal that a cluster of deceptive cues is on its way. This is a key reason why voters routinely associate Trump with authenticity: He rarely pauses.","Not all lies are harmful. Sometimes we're willing participants in deception for the sake of social dignity, maybe to keep a secret that should be kept secret, secret. We say, 'Nice song.' 'Honey, you don't look fat in that, no.'","A good lie detector doesn't jump to conclusions but tries to understand the person across the table, her personality, and her motivations. Your goal as a lie spotter isn't to point the finger and say, 'You're lying' - your goal is to get to the truth.","Cultists do not want to admit they have been manipulated by charisma. Nigerian money scheme victims do not want to accept that they had been swindled. To accept those realities is to accept their own faults. Denial of our own weaknesses is something we all suffer from time to time.","Pay attention to science and not myths: We think liars won't look you in the eyes, but it turns out an honest person will only look you in the eyes about 60 percent of the time.","Genuine expressions of emotion rarely persist longer than five seconds and almost never longer than 10. A fixed smile is likely to conceal anger, anxiety, or some other negative emotion.","Lying in the political sphere has gotten out of hand, and because people tend to dismiss things that challenge their preconceived notions of the world, fact checkers can only play a small part in remedying the problem.","If Edith Wharton lived in the Age of Innocence, surely we now live in the Age of Deception.","Studies by several different researchers have shown that the number of lies we're told each day is anywhere from 20 - 200. To many, that will seem shockingly high. Yet it isn't, in light of humans being ill-suited to detect lies. The average human can detect a lie only 54% of the time.","Truth in our society often takes a back seat to securing gainful consequences.","Lying is the rule, not the exception.","By the time we enter this work world and we're breadwinners, we enter a world that's just cluttered with spam, fake, digital friends, partisan media, ingenious identity thieves, world-class Ponzi schemers - a deception epidemic.","We lie more to strangers than we lie to co-workers. Extroverts lie more than introverts. Men lie eight times more about themselves than they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people.","Speaking of trust, ever since I wrote this book, 'Liespotting,' no one wants to meet me in person anymore - no, no, no, no, no. They say, 'It's okay. We'll email you.' I can't even get a coffee date at Starbucks. My husband's like, 'Honey, deception? Maybe you could have focused on cooking. How about French cooking?'","If you're an average married couple, you're going to lie to your spouse in one out of every 10 interactions. Now, you may think that's bad. If you're unmarried, that number drops to three.","A liar often smiles subtly while telling a lie; it's an unconscious expression of his delight in getting away with a whopper.","Study after study shows that people are much less likely to lie to a person they consider to be honest.","Any normal candidate who mocked the disabled or made crude reference to a woman's menstrual cycle or dabbled in 9/11 conspiracy theories would be out of the race. Trump's fans remain. And wait for more.","A narcissist like Trump must constantly inflate and exaggerate in order to keep the supply trains running. He has to brag about how, 'I have a very high IQ' or concoct stories about people agreeing with him.","Like it or not, we are all liars. Thank goodness. Imagine going through life where everyone is completely honest: 'Those shoes... look like something out of an early Cyndi Lauper video.' 'Your daughter... looks like the spawn of Honey Boo Boo and Elmer Fudd.'","The 'problem lies' are the half-dozen or so falsehoods we hear every day that can lead us down the wrong path in our careers, change how we do business, or dramatically influence our personal lives.","Tell the lie over and over and over. It's an art that Trump understands well. There's no better evidence than his absolutely false claim that he opposed the Iraq War in 2002.","Maybe Trump isn't a racist in private. But he's sure acting like one in public. And his body language is corroborating the evidence.","Truth-tellers who expect others to believe them tend to speak naturally and un-self-consciously. But if they don't expect to be believed, they may try too hard to seem honest. Unfortunately, the result makes them sound less believable. Obviously, then, not every oddly phrased statement is a lie.","In the split-second before someone prepares to answer a question, he will consciously or subconsciously evaluate what the best possible answer might be. For a truthful person, the best possible answer might omit some information. It might have a few extraneous details. But it will still offer the information requested.","Politicians aren't special. They lie the same way we all do, revealing their true nature under pressure.","Contempt is the only asymmetrical expression in the muscular facial system: Disgust, fear, happiness, surprise and anger typically express themselves symmetrically. Contempt is marked by one lip corner pulled up and in a dismissive sneer.","High-stakes lying is out of control. And it's costing us big bucks in one way or another. It's not simply a matter of quantifying losses in dollars. It's costing us emotionally and psychologically as well.","Contempt is the only asymmetrical facial expression, so it's easy to spot once you're aware of its signs. One researcher has successfully tracked it in couples as a predictor of divorce. When someone is angry at you, you've still got traction with them, but when they display contempt, you've been dismissed.","Pummeling an answer out of someone never works. You cannot intimidate someone with aggressive language and think they'll be more forthcoming... that's a caricature of interrogation, part of the TV culture of what it looks like.","Business is a battlefield. You need to be able to go to battle with your team members. Like the military. Know them, trust them, and know who you're working with.","It's counterintuitive to take a long time to hire someone, but it will save you enormous amounts of time and money later. Our biggest mistakes in hiring stem from speed.","Breaks in trust are infuriating and hurtful, but they don't entitle you to flame out, throw a fit, or stomp around rolling your eyes. Try to keep the steam from coming out of your ears.","The more you talk about - and live by - your principles, the harder it will be for others to treat you in a morally ambiguous manner.","While it can feel unfair to have to make a career decision because of a morally deficient boss, doing so can sometimes lead you in the right direction, if a bit faster than you otherwise would have preferred."],"Pamela Nicholson":["Luckily, I work for a company that promotes on performance.","When I started in California, people would say, 'Enterprise who?'","Throughout my Enterprise career, I have been primarily operationally focused.","For me to be as effective as possible, I intend to sharpen those skills I need to successfully lead an organization that is growing in size and complexity with each passing year.","It has been most rewarding to work in St. Louis, California, and New York and watch the people there grow and be promoted and go off to other opportunities and positions of responsibility."],"Pamela Sargent":["People who know very little about ancient Egypt are most likely, if they know anything at all, to have at least a vague idea about the Pharaoh Akhenaten and be able to recognize the face of his beautiful wife, Nefertiti.","Ancient Egyptians went to great lengths to avoid change; they couldn't entirely do so, of course, but did preserve a cultural continuity for almost four thousand years.","Akhenaten's allegedly monotheistic worship of Aten and the more naturalistic art produced during his reign, a revolutionary break from the more formal art of earlier periods, have made him a sympathetic figure to many.","I watched the first moon landing at a bar in Paducah, Kentucky, a fact worth mentioning only because I still remember how suddenly silence descended on this raucous place when Neil Armstrong started coming down that ladder.","'Floating Worlds,' published in 1975 and the lone science fiction novel by acclaimed historical novelist Cecelia Holland, was unique in being completely devoid of the usual pulp influences present in much space opera up to that time.","'Floating Worlds,' which received a fair amount of attention when it was first published, deserves rediscovery.","What 'Floating Worlds' does draw on is Holland's artistry in bringing the past to life in her historical fiction and depicting the people who inhabited that past.","Some people become passionate readers and fans of science fiction during childhood or adolescence. I picked up on SF somewhat later than that; my escape reading of choice during my youth was historical novels, and one of my favorite writers was Mary Renault.","Historical fiction is actually good preparation for reading SF. Both the historical novelist and the science fiction writer are writing about worlds unlike our own.","The historical novelist has to consider what has actually happened, while the SF writer is dealing in possibilities, but they are both in the business of imagining a world unlike our own and yet connected to it.","A feeling for history is almost an essential for writing and appreciating good science fiction, for sensing the connections between the past and future that run through our present.","My grandfather allowed as how I might even live long enough to see a Mars landing. I haven't, of course, except in fiction, including my own, and strongly doubt that I ever will."],"Pamela Stephenson":["Perfect objectivity is always impossible, no matter who writes a person's biography.","Love is an obsession. It has that quality to it. But there are healthy obsessions, and mine is one of them.","I grew up in the suburbs of Sydney, an arid kind of place, but every day I took the ferry across the harbour to get to school. I'd watch the ships coming in and going out.","I loved my life, but my choices were overloading and overwhelming me. Listening to inner feelings and fulfilling some of these urges when they come along is incredibly important.","Suffering from dysentery at sea was no picnic.","Being a psychologist did enable me to maintain objectivity.","After all my probing into the human brain, I should still be aware of mysteries and come up with them myself.","I don't like the term mid-life crisis.","I don't think I'm generous enough to be the straight guy. I sort of make my own way and make my own statement. Do I mind pushing myself forward? Not at all.","I've really written my books for my husband and our family. They've brought us closer together by allowing us to discuss things that were unspoken for so long.","It is one thing to go on stage and be funny or be in a good place in your career, but for a woman, actually facing the elements in a physical way is a very powerful thing.","Most people who went about saying a ghost had poked them with a brolly would be locked up somewhere.","Sexual dreams aren't usually about sex.","So many people suffer from abuse, and suffer alone.","The notion of a contemporary epiphany to me is very exciting, because it's a sort of biblical thing. It's something that has happened to people in other centuries or in the context of religious experience.","The work of a psychotherapist involves being empathic and insightful with one's patients without getting too lost in their painful stories to be helpful.","There's been a number of erroneous biographies, articles and so on written about Billy and we both thought it would be a good idea to produce a true one.","There is a probably natural and learned reticence with myself talking about my early life.","There may be a point where I may decide to write an autobiography.","There seems to be this impression that if I really am a psychotherapist, I can't be serious about it. They think there must be something fishy going on.","There was a special challenge in describing the awful childhood of a person who happens to be my own husband. It was very painful at times, for both of us.","We have a couple of dogs, but I wouldn't describe myself as an animal person.","When I came off the boat I was very proud of the thick calluses which had developed on my feet. But now, I am struggling to get into my favourite high heels which is a shame, as I have so many."],"Pamela Sue Martin":["If I got hit by a truck, I would want to go to hospital, but if something is bothering me I will see my naturopath.","I tend to worry about the minutiae of life. But living in the mountains of Idaho and having retreated from fame, I am more in tune with life.","I try to live holistically and avoid conventional medicine.","A naturopath once told me you should never take antibiotics except if you have pneumonia, a kidney infection or some other serious illness. That's my philosophy, too."],"Panayiotis Zavos":["We're not interested in cloning the Michael Jordans and Michael Jacksons of the world, but rather assisting infertile couples that deserve the right to have a biological child to have one.","There is absolutely no doubt about it, and I may not be the one that does it, but the cloned child is coming. There is absolutely no way that it will not happen.","If we intensify our efforts we can have a cloned baby within a year or two, but I don't know whether we can intensify our efforts to that extent. We're not really under pressure to deliver a cloned baby to this world. What we are under pressure to do is to deliver a cloned baby that is a healthy one.","We are not interested in cloning the Michael Jordans and the Michael Jacksons of this world. The rich and the famous don't participate in this.","We're not lawbreakers, we're law-abiding, and intend to stay that way.","In the future, when we get serious about executing things correctly, this thing will be very easy to do. If we find out that this technique does not work, I don't intend to step on dead bodies to achieve something because I don't have that kind of ambition. My ambition is to help people.","We're not really under pressure to deliver a cloned baby to this world. What we are under pressure to do is to deliver a cloned baby that is a healthy one.","My motivation is my desire to help people. If people want to have children and cannot in the normal way, and I can do something about it, then I will do so.","We managed to write chapter one. Chapter two, we will have a child a parent can take home and raise as a cloned child."],"Pancho Gonzales":["The great champions were always vicious competitors. You never lose respect for a man who is a vicious competitor, and you never hate a man you respect. I don't like Rod Laver because he's such a vicious competitor, but I don't dislike him.","I'm just glad Open tennis is here. It's great for the game. That's more important."],"Pancho Villa":["I am not an educated man. I never had an opportunity to learn anything except how to fight.","My sole ambition is to rid Mexico of the class that has oppressed her and given the people a chance to know what real liberty means. And if I could bring that about today by giving up my life, I would do it gladly.","Don't let it end like this. Tell them I said something."],"Pankaj Mishra":["The British Empire passed quickly and with less humiliation than its French and Dutch counterparts, but decades later, the vicious politics of partition still seems to define India and Pakistan.","The French Revolution actualised the Enlightenment's greatest intellectual breakthrough: detaching the political from the theocratic.","After the oil crisis of 1973, many European countries tightened restrictions on immigrants. By then, millions of Muslims had decided to settle in Europe, preferring the social segregation and racial discrimination they found in the West to political and economic turmoil at home.","In a typically contradictory move, globalisation, while promoting economic integration among elites, has exacerbated sectarianism everywhere else.","Tanpinar presciently feared that to embrace the western conception of progress was to be mentally enslaved by a whole new epistemology, one that compartmentalised knowledge and concealed an instrumental view of human beings as no more than things to be manipulated.","Indonesia's diversity is formidable: some thirteen and a half thousand islands, two hundred and fifty million people, around three hundred and sixty ethnic groups, and more than seven hundred languages.","Enlightenment values of individual freedom are manifested best in individual acts of criticism and defiance.","Though blessed with many able administrators, the British found India just too large and diverse to handle. Many of their decisions stoked Hindu-Muslim tensions, imposing sharp new religious-political identities on Indians.","As a young man in South Africa at the beginning of the twentieth century, Gandhi developed satyagraha, a mode of political activism based upon moral persuasion, while mobilizing South Africa's small Indian minority against racial discrimination.","Life in a Chinese village is much more organised because the Chinese Communist Party has a presence even in the remotest Chinese village - a presence of the kind that no governmental or non-governmental organisation has in Indian villages.","I think the presence of caste in India, how the villages are geographically structured on caste lines, is very different from China. The presence of an egalitarian culture is striking in a Chinese village.","German writers in the late 18th century were the first to uphold a prickly, literary nationalism, in reaction to the then dominance and prestige of French literature.","No Muslim country has ever done as much as Turkey to make itself over in the image of a European nation-state; the country's westernised elite brutally imposed secularism, among other things, on its devout population of peasants.","The Turkish, Arab and Chinese nationalists who built new nation-states out of the ruins of old empires scorned their old, decrepit rulers as much as they did the foreign imperialists who imposed free trade through gunboats.","Economic disasters or foolish wars are hardly guaranteed to bring about large-scale individual self-examination or renew the appeal of truly participatory democracy.","It turns out that globalisation, while promising sameness through brand-name consumption, was fostering, through uneven economic growth, an intense feeling of difference.","As the 19th century progressed, Europe's innovations, norms and categories came to achieve a truly universal hegemony.","An enlarged global public society, with its many dissenting and corrective voices, can quickly call the bluff of lavishly credentialled and smug intellectual elites.","In 1980, shortly before my 11th birthday, I wrote my first essay in English.","Certainly, imperial power is never peaceably acquired or maintained.","The Indonesian nationalists, mainly Javanese, who threw the Dutch out - in 1949, after a four-year struggle - were keen to preserve their inheritance and emulated the coercion, deceit, and bribery of the colonial rulers.","Ordinary Muslims in Europe, who suffer from the demoralisation caused by living as perennial objects of suspicion and contempt, are far from thinking of themselves as a politically powerful, or even cohesive, community, not to speak of conquerors of Europe.","Gandhi's ideas were rooted in a wide experience of a freshly globalized world.","Thomas Friedman's 'The World is Flat' sold more copies in India than in the U.K. The market for go-getting business books or wonkish tomes by corporate moguls posing as philosopher kings has grown dramatically in modernising China and India.","As in the early 20th century, the elemental forces of globalisation have unravelled broad solidarities and loyalties.","The idea that modernisation makes for enhanced national power and rapid progress and helps everyone achieve greater happiness has its origins in the astonishing political, economic and military successes of western Europe in the 19th century.","The terrorist attacks of 9/11 briefly disrupted celebrations of a world globalised by capital and consumption.","It should be no surprise that religion in the non-western world has failed to disappear under the juggernaut of industrial capitalism, or that liberal democracy finds its most dedicated saboteurs among the new middle classes.","Countries that managed to rebuild commanding state structures after popular nationalist revolutions - such as China, Vietnam, and Iran - look stable and cohesive when compared with a traditional monarchy such as Thailand or wholly artificial nation-states like Iraq and Syria.","Since the end of the Cold War, metropolitan elites everywhere have identified progress and modernity with the cornucopia of global capitalism, the consolidation of liberal democratic regimes and the secular ethic of consumerism.","Political elites look increasingly interchangeable: Blair, Brown, and Cameron have all tried to provide cover for the surrender of sovereignty to foreign investors with invocations of 'British' values, and, more opportunistically, anti-immigrant rhetoric.","Minorities within nation-states frayed by global capitalism are naturally more resentful of hollowed-out but still heavily centralised systems of political and economic domination.","As the years passed in my village, I witnessed poorly educated young men leaving to seek the greater comforts and liberations of big cities. I would see them on my visits to Delhi.","Policymakers can draw much from 'The Need for Roots': such clear prescriptions as that employers ought to provide an adequate vocational training for their employees, education should be compulsory and publicly funded, and include technical as well as elementary education.","A free and rooted society ought to consist of a web of moral obligations. We have the right to ignore them, but we ought to be actually obliged not to let other people starve or to let them lapse into destitution.","The Sino-Indian War in 1962 has fundamentally shaped and distorted Indian attitudes towards China. It also obscured a great deal of what has happened in China since 1962.","As an Indian, you feel easily connected with certain histories in places like Indonesia, where one sees, because of the presence of the Hindu-Buddhist past, Hindus still living there or Muslims performing rituals that are instantly familiar.","If your writing collides with the conventional wisdom, there's going to be some kind of friction.","My dominant feeling every day is one of great ignorance.","As a writer, I tend to be drawn to marginal people - writers, poet-prophets, seers, eccentrics - who embody the deeper ambivalences of their societies and bear deeper witness to their world than the famous figures we are used to celebrating, or demonizing, in our histories.","The Arab Spring showed that people are not going to wait for an American president to make good on his big talk about democracy and human rights; they are going to fight for those rights themselves and overthrow pro-American dictators who stand in their way.","I think there is no reason for us to bring to Islamism or political Islam the fear and ignorance of Western commentators and their hysterical vocabulary.","'Islamism' itself is such a broad and nearly meaningless word as used by the mainstream Western press, including everything from Turkey's AKP party to al Qaeda.","I think subsuming political and economic conflicts into some grand 'clash of civilisations' theory or 'the West versus the rest' binary is a particularly insidious form of ideological deception.","I started out as a novelist and wrote several novels before deciding to publish one, and I fully intend to go back to the form.","If you think of India in the 1980s, there weren't many writers in English around. The ones that were there, Amitav Ghosh or Vikram Seth, were living abroad or publishing from abroad.","I grew up in small towns in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra - places like Akola, Betul, Wardha, Jhansi; I thought the rise of provincial India would be an interesting subject to tackle.","My life was made easy - I lived in a village, and by writing for some newspapers and magazines, had enough to live on. I was happy to be there and write.","Basically, I think of fiction and non-fiction as different ways of engaging with the world. You reach a point where you feel you have said all you possibly can, in reportage or a review essay or a reflection on history, which 'From the Ruins of Empire' was.","The White House tapes, the recordings that Nixon made of his conversations in office, have long been recognized as a marvel of verbal incontinence.","Force-backed humanitarianism, which relies on rational influence over events in other countries, may have been a more feasible project in the bipolar era of the Cold War, with its relatively defined and stable web of alliances and proxies.","Obama was expected to restore an ethical sheen to post-9/11 foreign policy, but he has intensified drone warfare in Yemen and Pakistan, pursued whistle-blowers, and failed to close down Guantanamo.","After India and China, Indonesia was the biggest new nation-state to emerge in the mid-twentieth century.","Indonesia is hardly immune to catastrophic breakdowns, as the anti-Communist pogrom showed. But, like India, it has been relatively fortunate in evolving a mode of politics that can include many discontinuities - of class, region, ethnicity, and religion.","In 1853, American warships bullied Japan out of centuries of virtual isolation and into the modern world. The threat of force compelled Japan, like India and China before it, to accept trade agreements that were economically ruinous and eroded national sovereignty.","Like the Britain of Beaverbrook and Kipling, Japan in the early twentieth century was a jingoistic nation, subduing weaker countries with the help of populist politicians and sensationalist journalism.","In 1919, at the Paris Peace Conference, Japan had put forward a proposal to guarantee racial equality at the League of Nations, but Woodrow Wilson overturned it in the face of majority support.","Gandhi, brought out of his semirural setting and given a Western-style education, initially attempted to become more English than the English.","The Korean War, which China entered on the side of North Korea, fixed Mao's image in the United States as another unappeasable Communist.","To Westerners, the students at Tiananmen may have given an impression of a solid and energetic consensus against dictatorship and for democracy, but they were an egotistical and fractious lot, riven by disagreements over tactics and money.","Tiananmen Square in early 1989 attracted many dreamers like Ma Jian, who returned from Hong Kong to a one-room shack in Beijing in order to join the student protests.","As the spiritual leader of six million people, the Dalai Lama can be credited with a significant renunciation of the authority of tradition - of the conventional politics of national self-interest as well as of religion.","The Dalai Lama can claim the sanction of the Buddha, who is said to have altered his teachings in order to reach a diverse audience.","Ineptitude and negligence directed British policies in India more than any cynical desire to divide and rule, but the British were not above exploiting rivalries.","Many ethnic minorities chafed at the postcolonial nationalism of India and Pakistan, and some rebelled.","Decolonisation seems to have dented little the sense of superiority that since 1945 has made American leaders in particular consistently underestimate the intensity of nationalist feeling in Asia and Africa.","In the 1950s and 60s, geopolitical intrigues did not much engage masses in Asia and Africa; it was something for elites to sort out.","The onslaught of new and complex information, the academic and thinktank cults of expertise, not to mention the impossibility of bohemia in the age of high rents, have conspired to assassinate the public intellectual.","National independence, and the preceding political struggles, helped create the space for literary creation in many post-colonial countries. Much of modern Indian or Chinese literature is inconceivable without the political movement for freedom from foreign rule.","Local markets for literary fiction remain underdeveloped; the metropolis often holds out the only real possibility of a professional writing career.","Many writers from the suburbs of history, such as Ireland and Argentina, produced more original work than their counterparts in the United States; they still seem to.","In a democratic age, you can't buck demography - except through civil war.","Happily, financial capitalism and free trade have not done away with national languages and literatures, as Marx rather too blithely hoped.","Tenured professors are more prone than the rest of us to think that the university is the universe.","I am often struck by the anxious inferiority many well-educated British people display towards the U.S., particularly Londoners dazzled by New York, when many postcolonials are accustomed to regarding Britain's old imperial cosmopolis as the true capital of the western world.","Living in a cultural milieu where the foreign writers most widely available and admired were Russian, I came very late to postwar American writers, and I had great trouble with the canonically exalted white male writers I tried first.","The cultural decoding that many American writers require has become an even harder task in the age of globalisation. The experience they describe has grown more private; its essential background, the busy larger world, has receded.","Democracy, loudly upheld as a cure for much of the ailing world, has proved no guarantor of political wisdom, even if it remains the least bad form of government.","Shallowness and ignorance have been our lot in the mass consumer societies we inhabit, where we were too distracted to act politically, apart from periodically deputing political elites to take life-and-death decisions on our behalf.","Many Indians and Israelis seem set to elect, with untroubled consciences, those who speak the language of torturers and terrorists. More disturbingly, these corrupted democracies may increasingly prove the norm rather than the exception.","The clash of civilizations or the clash between Islam and the West may be cliches. But there is an even bigger cliche around: that this clash actually goes on within Islam, between reformists and fanatics.","So much of western self-perception and intellectual worldview has been shaped by the moral rhetoric of the Cold War, the discourse in which communism featured as a clear enemy, determined to rule the world.","Just as China achieved much more than India in the realm of public health and education under an austere Communist regime, so its economic growth under a capitalist-friendly government strikes a visitor from India as nothing less than spectacular.","In December 2004, I travelled on the road from Uzbekistan across the Oxus River on which the first Soviet convoys had rolled into Afghanistan 25 years before.","For boys like me, in north Indian railway towns in the '70s and '80s, where nothing much happened apart from the arrival and departure of trains from big cities, the Soviet Union alone appeared to promise an escape from our limited, dusty world.","It's strange to recall that America animated none of my youthful daydreams. I did not see a Hollywood film until my late teens.","Britain's unique success as an industrialised nation-state prompted strong imitative endeavours not only across Europe, but also in Asia. Now many people, who were once humiliated into a sense of nationality by British rule, loom larger than their former masters.","Devout Anatolian masses rising from poverty have transformed Turkey politically and economically.","Though there are laws against blasphemy and insult to religion in many European countries, France has institutionalised its anti-clerical past by proscribing religion from public life.","The advocates of retaliatory wars will continue to assume a much simpler reality with their hoary oppositions: Religious and secular, backward and enlightened, free and unfree. But if we are to admit how deeply and irrevocably interconnected our world is, then we must find new ways to break the cycle of counter-productive violence.","Governments everywhere that are unable to guarantee equitable growth and social welfare have suffered a fatal decay of legitimacy.","For almost a century since 1918, the centralised nation-state has been the world's default political form. Its various experiments in industrialisation, urbanisation, mass literacy and consumerism have brought more people into public life."],"Pankaj Patel":["One of the big myths about philanthropy is that it's all about donating funds for a cause. I like to look at it quite differently. Philanthropy is about 'giving' - not just in monetary terms but also in non-monetary aspects, like time, ideas, or being a volunteer. Donating money is just a small part of philanthropy.","What we do tomorrow is more important than what we did yesterday.","Thinking of possibilities is like driving a car on a freeway. You have an open road that stretches endlessly before you where your thoughts are not shackled. But when we say 'impossible,' we have already reached a dead-end in our minds. So dwell on possibilities to open up your horizon.","During an economic slowdown, one needs to be cautious, but I think it's equally important to not get sucked into the vortex of defensive thinking.","Cadila, India's sixth-largest drugmaker by sales, spent $250 million developing Lipaglyn, a new chemical entity or new discovery, and aims to spend another $150 million to $200 million to launch the drug outside India.","It's the sum of the parts that make up the whole, so in my opinion excellence comes from how one undertakes to do something. It all begins with the thought process - which is creative and exalted to produce something out of the ordinary.","The first award that I recall having received was in the form of a scholarship when I was studying in the 5th standard. I was granted this scholarship for achieving academic excellence, and it continues to be one of the high points in my life.","Financial risk is always associated with drug discovery. But the benefit that a blockbuster drug can bring to the business can be phenomenal if you can take that risk."],"Pansy Ho":["I don't play. I'm a terrible gambler. I don't know half the rules, and I'm not really patient enough to sit through hours of gaming.","I almost always have a strong passion about the things I do. I wouldn't say aggressive, but I am always trying very hard to make sure that things will succeed.","I believe that the Chinese people as a whole love to make investments in real estate."],"Paolo Bacigalupi":["I'm really interested in how conflicts arise and how they reach points of no return. I'm no pacifist. Sometimes force is necessary. But war is a choice.","I'm particularly interested in black swan events: unprecedented surprises that destroy the conventional wisdom about how the world works.","I'm not proud of it, but I'm a great liar when I travel. I smile and lie, and things are smooth.","A wise human would have an understanding of the supply chain and how the pieces fit together. But it's against our nature to think about it.","Economies are embedded inside ecosystems. Companies dependent on tourism, for example, are affected by low rainfall - there's less snow for skiers, and forest fires are more intense.","I used to work for a newspaper that covered local resource issues, and my coworkers and friends were journalists. Their reporting work was always pretty grim.","All the definitions people want to put on you in terms of what kind of writer you are come with hidden meanings. If you're writing science fiction, you're writing rocket ships. If you write dystopian fiction, it's inequity where The Man must be fought.","I say I write extrapolations. I look at data points and ask what the world could look like.","Novelists want to be published and need a publisher to decide to print 20,000 copies. So you need to entertain on some level. I want to reach out and connect.","The young adult category is particularly interesting to me in terms of science fiction and fantasy tropes.","People don't actually stay still, you know - when their area is a disaster, they go somewhere else, right? And that's just a natural human impulse.","I think that, when I think about the future that 'The Water Knife' represents, it's one where there's a lack of oversight, planning and organization.","When I think about myself as a writer, for sure I am a science fiction writer. The tools of extrapolation, the tools of anticipating the future - those are science fictional questions.","Mostly I sat down and said, 'I'm not going to write a boring story.' And that actually, surprisingly, solves most of your problems.","The things that have really gotten confusing to me is how you balance the desires of your publishers to produce things on a schedule, and people are always sort of giving you ideas on what you should follow up with or how you should proceed next and things like that.","I think inherently, a little bit, I'm a bit of a pleaser, and I want people to like me and be nice, and to not ruffle feathers and just make everybody happy and stuff. It's a personality flaw.","By nature I'm sort of an introvert.","I was interested in political failure here in the U.S. The way we're failing to work together to solve even our smallest problems, let alone the complex ones.","I focus a little more on pacing when I write books in the young adult category, and of course there's the great American fear of anything sexual, so that's somewhat backed off in YA.","Fiction is optimistic or unrealistic enough to demand that there should be a meaningful narrative.","When we talk about dystopias, especially in young adult fiction, a lot of them are essentially science fictional futures. They aren't necessarily tied to the traditional concept of dystopia. And so in that space, my impression is that kids love reading about weird, wild, adventurous places, and dystopia fits that bill.","I don't put a very clear label on my work. If anything, I write science fiction - looking at a moment now, in the present, and then extrapolating outward to think about what the future might look like if this particular trend goes on, or if this particular trend is the most dominant. That's a science fictional tool.","Sometimes when we label something dystopian fiction, I feel like we're trying very hard not to use the words 'science fiction,' because science fiction has those horrible connotations of rocket ships and bodacious babes.","As a kid, I always liked reading stories where I had a power-projection fantasy. I wanted to be inside of a story where I had power and influence, was going to rise to power, was going to somehow influence my society.","When we live the 21st-century good life, almost every aspect of it is predicated on not looking at the implications of what we're up to. Happiness at this point has a lot to do with not looking, so you don't feel complicit in some vast and awful enterprise.","The conclusion I came to was that even if I couldn't sell books, I still liked the process of writing.","I'm less crazy and unhappy when I'm writing.","I have friends who are science journalists, and I'm seeing stories of theirs or talking with them about ideas that they're pitching. Certain kinds of science are around me all the time, like climate change and biology.","I am interested in agricultural corporations and how they function. The idea that they own the genetics of our food supply is a really compelling thing to me.","Science fiction has these obsessions with certain sciences - large scale engineering, neuroscience.","I think the fact that we, as writers, don't engage with resource-level questions is a symptom of our society where we just don't know where our stuff comes from.","As far as 'Windup Girl' becoming a hit - none of us expected that. 'Night Shade' was just hoping not to lose their shirts, and I had grown up hearing from everyone that science fiction didn't sell, so all of our expectations were very low.","Originally, 'The Windup Girl' started as a short story - a very gnarly, complicated short story set in Bangkok that didn't work very well.","I think there are narratives going on all the time that we think of as tangential - up until they turn out to be deciding factors in our lives.","I think that we live in a highly specialized, technologically advanced society. Highly developed societies tend to have very remote understandings about what underlies our prosperity.","I'm interested in how we react when we're heavily pressed. When we're vulnerable and our survival is in question, how do we behave?","I don't know why we choose to reach out to help another person, or why we decide that we can't, and withdraw and try to care only for ourselves, but I'm fascinated by that choice.","I started really thinking a lot about where does a country go when we stop being able to speak to each other, when a nation stops being able to solve problems because its ideological differences become so deep that it just becomes dysfunctional.","When somebody keeps telling you, 'This book is amazing,' you sort of have this pleasing instinct to say, 'Oh, let me make you happy again; let me do that trick again.'","When I was writing 'The Windup Girl' and 'Ship Breaker,' I was writing those simultaneously, so I was an unpublished writer, not really having that full sense that these books would go out in the world, that they would be successful, that there would be an audience and that there would be fans of those stories.","My conception of my ideal reader has expanded quite a lot as I've matured: Ultimately when I think of my ideal reader, it's someone who's not sitting down with the intention of automatically arguing with the book: somebody who's going to give me enough slack to tell my story.","I suspect that young adults crave stories of broken futures because they themselves are uneasily aware that their world is falling apart.","Teens want to read something that isn't a lie; we adults wish we could put our heads under the blankets and hide from the scary story we're writing for our kids.","As an author, you're really grateful for the people who are supporting you, but on some other level, that can be a dangerous echo chamber.","The sources and research I use for my inspiration aren't your typical sci-fi subjects, but it's really driven by obsession and personal anxiety more than trying to take up the sword and do what's right.","I know people who have gone into career death spins, and that's something you're always aware of as a writer.","As a writer, you should care about reluctant readers. You want these kids to feel like books are amazing and cool and that they're an escape.","Businesses that decide to be reality based and identify where they're vulnerable to climate impact, that start thinking about how to buffer against it, are going to be able to take advantage of shortages. When the water runs out, not everyone is in the same pickle.","The marketplace tells us that good, visceral storytelling has a place. But there are lots of questions about the format that stories take.","Maybe storytelling belongs in audio - a short story is the length of a commute. That can be a sacred spot where you have the ear of the reader without having to compete with other media like games or TV.","The loneliest Chinese man I ever met lived halfway up the Three Gorges, in Sichuan Province.","Everyone in China knows The Topics. The television stations and newspapers run the same state-generated stories all across the country, and the Chinese form their opinions based on these somewhat controlled sources.","I didn't think of myself as writing 'cli-fi,' but I'll take the label. I'll take any label that makes someone think they might be interested in my stories.","There are parents who are really angry that I decided to portray people who have come into the country illegally as decent human beings.","I'm definitely writing my fears. It's almost therapeutic to at least voice a terror, to say, 'I'm worried that Lake Powell looks low and Lake Mead looks even lower.'","We're all happier when we know less, because the details are frightening and haven't really improved much. The more you pay attention, the more horrifying the world is."],"Paolo Gentiloni":["I want to say very clearly that the government... is ready to intervene in order to guarantee the stability of banks and the savings of our citizens.","The E.U. cannot give up on common solidarity. The idea that every country does its own thing, and history and geography decides whose turn it is - whether Greece or Italy or Spain or, who knows, even Poland if there's a crisis in north-eastern Europe - that just can't be. There has to be a common policy.","I am not in a position to be accurate on news analysis. But what I firmly believe is that Iranian President Rouhani and the government have committed themselves to a process. I don't think this process is about changing the principles of the Islamic republic, but it is about accepting a certain path of opening in the political and economic fields.","Italy has no colonial past in Iran.","If necessary, Italy is prepared to fight against Islamic State in Libya because the Italian government cannot accept a terrorist danger in power just a few hours away from Italy by boat.","I know that many in Germany think we have a merry financial policy over here.","Europe - with hundreds of millions of people - can accept hundreds of thousands of migrants.","On immigration, Europe is in danger of displaying the worst of itself: selfishness, haphazard decision-making and rows between member states.","The migratory phenomenon exists, and Europe will have to face it together. The only alternative is a 'beggar-thy-neighbor' solution, in which countries try to load the problem off on their neighbors.","Responding to terrorism inevitably implies military consequences. This may shock some people, but these groups must also be dealt with on a military footing. I won't use the word 'combat' to avoid being painted as a crusader.","I'm aware of the urgency to give Italy a government in the fullness of its powers, to reassure the citizens, and to face with utmost commitment and determination international, economic and social priorities.","It is very important to have good relations with the United States.","We are in favor of free trade.","Italian design is a global excellence, on a par with food, culture, cinema, and, more generally, lifestyle.","The fight against terrorism and fundamentalism knows no frontier. We need to act together and to step up cooperation at a global level.","We must not forget that culture is the key tool to make society advance and defeat all forms of radicalism.","Italy remains deeply engaged in the global fight against terrorism as well as on domestic programmes against radicalisation.","If someone thinks the course of Italian politics will become anti-European, against an open society, against trade, or populist, as they say today, the facts will prove them wrong.","Italy is a free country. Its voters decide freely.","Italy is working to make sure the Brexit shock is an opportunity for a European reawakening.","We always have to remember that we, the Italians, have always cooperated with the U.S., and with Reagan and Carter and Nixon and Clinton, Bush and Obama. And Trump, Trump is the American-elected president. So, cooperation is there."],"Paolo Nutini":["I try not to get too self-absorbed.","Music is probably one of the most honest things out there - it's feral.","I love melon! I don't love melon; that's a bit... Melon's my favorite fruit.","I don't discriminate when it comes to melon. I'm very open-minded. I really don't mind; I can't say I like any one better than the other. You can put them all in! A little melon mix salad, and I'm just in heaven.","When life hands you melons, eat them.","Always wash your hands, and always tell the truth.","One of the best things I get to do is meet people that have been to the shows and listened to the music. I still don't indulge in the social media side of things, so that's my way of starting conversations - actually hearing people talk.","I've learned stuff, and I've forgotten stuff, but what I do know is that it really is all about the fans.","People make you feel like a bad guy for asking for seven quid for your album, like you are slapping them in the face, when they'll go and pay two grand for a scarf somebody knitted in a sweat shop and stitched a designer label on.","You should have something to say, an idea you want to get out, and if you don't, just get out of the way, 'cause there's so many great musicians and writers that are in the queue.","I don't know if I've got the capacity for all of the creativity that I want to put out there, which is annoying and frustrating - it's kinda like torture.","Some people have just got a capacity for creativity that's unbelievable!","A lot of people have been very dismissive of me. I'm hardly the darling of the NME. It used to get me down a bit, but you reach a point where you can laugh it off.","My parents worked very hard for me and my sister.","I remember I wanted to be Zorro, but I also wanted to be a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle. I obviously had ideas above my station.","When I got my first publishing deal, I felt some responsibility to try to write with the people that they were asking me to write with.","Music can really help people, help individuals in beautiful ways.","Whatever I do, I like to be the one doing it. I don't just like to get someone in to run it and put a name to it.","I never, ever thought I would get to say I was opening a show for the Bay City Rollers.","I went through a phase of buying a lot of masks, as anyone who has been to a party at the house will testify.","When you've displayed a weakness, you've displayed something a person can grab a hold of and attack you there. If you're not ashamed of it, who can make you feel bad about it? Nobody. If you make a mistake, at least you get to see them, identify them, acknowledge them and hopefully remedy them.","I like to indulge all the facets of my personality. There's none that I don't think, in a way, I would want to take away from.","None of us don't have a vice.","I'm at the point of view that I have to look after myself in various levels.","I started to learn some common sense. Even just sort of day-to-day things. I started to cook a little bit more and try to learn to fix things around the house. If something breaks down, rather than call a guy, there's got to be more I can do.","My songwriting... it's almost like a kind of self-therapy.","I'm not one to go down that road to say I have some kind of social consciousness.","When I think of Paisley, I think of everything that has shaped my life.","The first time I did everything was in Paisley - the first time I went to the pictures or the bowling or the ice rink or the swimming baths.","I've always enjoyed the bohemia of Paisley.","Paisley offered me and my family a life, way back, and it has continued to do so.","The success was a difficult thing for me to get my head round. When it gets too much, I just have to disappear - to sort my head.","The way you react to each challenge forms who you become.","Politicians have an arrogance that I just do not understand. I've seen more constructive debates in high school.","The more I watch politicians in action, it just makes me angry.","I come from Paisley, the same town as David Sneddon, who won 'Fame Academy.' When he was late for his homecoming reception in the town hall, they held an impromptu talent show. I ended up singing some songs, and that's how I was discovered.","Music is a good way to channel your fragile, vulnerable, needy side, but it's also something to rejoice in.","You walk with a different air if you're wearing something sharp.","Sometimes the last thing you want to do is to go on stage and bare your soul in front of hundreds of complete strangers. Singing the same songs night after night can remind you of things you'd rather forget.","To sing with Led Zeppelin has allowed me to offer the best places I could afford to my family and friends!","I'm not seeking for answers; I just want to tell stories and state my opinion.","I'm always looking for people to play the songs to.","Really, if you've got people who want you to play, you play.","It's not about someone making a difference on their own; it's about everybody pulling together to make a difference.","All of a sudden, my picture's in the paper, or I'm making a music video, and it's still the most surreal experience. I thought you could learn, and you would acclimatise, but I really haven't.","When things get too grand or too big, I struggle to keep up with it all.","When you're waking up every day, and it's all about you, I don't consider that to be a way to live your life if you can help it. I think people who know me know that I find time to enjoy myself and not take life - or myself - too seriously at all.","The songs are just an attempt to document what's been happening in my life. If people can relate to what's going on with me, then that's great.","You've got to make sure that you don't have an airbrushed picture making you look like a 15-year-old cherub when your lyrics suggest otherwise.","It's all a progression towards hopefully one day making a record that can be the definitive you can offer. Some bands come in with that at first, and the great bands never really stray from that. I want to earn my stripes.","My father was very encouraging.","Charts and learning the politics behind making a record - it's pretty soulless.","I've met such amazing people in their 40s, in their 60s, 70s, and they completely bely their age on paper.","Maybe it's the way that I do music, but I was never in a cool indie band or hung out with all the cool arty kids when I came to London.","My best mates when I was 19 were all in their 30s. I used to go to all their house parties, and they were crazier than the guys who were 17, 18. They were so much more liberated than the people who were apparently shackle-free.","When you open your mind up, and you go into a creative state, you can't just switch if off. When you have an idea, a creative impulse, and then you ignore it, it can keep you up when you just want to go to your bed - which is why it's great to have voice recorders on your phone!","To be honest, the first time round, I didn't think 'Fame Academy' was the worst premise in the world. You got people on, and they would write songs and develop themselves as artists. But then, instead of getting a little bit more credible, it got a little bit more ridiculous.","I'm neither here nor there about this Lady Gaga, but she's clearly very passionate about her poker face.","Love is music, and music is home.","I thought about going onto the first one, Pop Idol. My mum was saying, 'Go on!' But I decided not to. 'The X Factor,' though, doesn't really seem to be a show about musical talent anymore.","When it comes to the business side of it, as much as you might hate it, the reality is that you give the record company a sort of ownership of your songs, so you've got to make sure you're getting everything you can out of it now, because if you're not, then who is?","Touring can be really tiring. I can get homesick, and I spend a lot of time on my phone.","I'm not a fan of second-hand or vintage clothes.","I only became interested in clothes when I was in my mid-teens. I'd do things like spike my hair and put on a nice shirt, but I'd hardly call myself fashion-conscious. I just don't have the energy.","One of my ambitions is to move to Tuscany. I like the idea of getting a vineyard. I love being under the sun and being casual and comfortable. That's my idea of heaven.","You don't want to go and make something, then go out and do shows, if you're not really into it. You don't want to go out there and make people feel like you're grudging playing them a song. That's a disturbing thought.","I left school just shy of 17: I'd started going into touring and that situation.","I am not steeped in all that angst. I'm never going to be Sid Vicious.","Sometimes when you get frustrated, your back is against the wall, and you come out fighting and knock out three songs in as many days.","I'm in the highest bracket. There's no way that a 22-year-old should be hit for that amount of money when he's got his whole life ahead of him.","It's a sacred thing, but I do want to get married. I'd love that.","I think it was definitely a love for the four- or five-part vocal male harmony groups that really took me away. I'd always try and be, like, the fifth Drifter; I'd always try and find another harmony that wasn't there.","With the first album, there was a lot of angst. I was very naive. I thought I was on top of the whole thing, but I really didn't know what I was getting into.","When I've got time off, my feet get itchy really quickly.","A lot of places think that bigger is better. It's like consumerism is taking everything over.","One of my favourite songs is 'A Message to You, Rudy,' which was done by the Specials.","If you're going to call yourself a musician, you have to go out and make music.","I get nervous all the time. Both on and off stage. You just hope it turns into adrenaline.","I've always got a notepad on or a voice recorder recording ideas.","I write on the acoustic guitar, I write some on the piano, but I've been messing around with these guitar pedals and drum machines, educating myself in that world.","I like to record something pretty much as soon as I have an idea for a song, but I'm on so many buses, I have to record on my mobile.","As I'm getting older, I work out what I want and what I need. And I just need to go home and see the people I love and write.","I don't want to slip into Johnny Borrell mode. I don't want to be singing that there's nothing on TV, nothing on the radio.","I know some bands that are precious about their new ideas. They're conscious of the fact that people can - even from mobile phones - begin to get clearer and better recordings of the songs... so they're a lot more hesitant to play them.","That's the good thing about music: you can sing about people's lives in its stages and feelings. Some songs can put something in context that you couldn't. They can free your mind or can make you think or can be redeeming.","Sometimes it's good to just sing and let the words come out. Whatever comes out is valid because it's what you were thinking.","Just remember that if you've lost something, you will be open to something else.","My inspiration for songs is just everyday life. I just write down words about things that have happened to me, people I've met.","'Astral Weeks' is a brilliant album, and songs like 'Moondance' are just beautiful lyrically.","I can't speak much Italian. I do go down well over there, but it's frustrating because I can't really speak it. Even if I do talk, they can't understand my accent, but I should try to learn it.","The first record I was really into was the Drifters' 'When My Little Girl Is Smiling.'","I just want people to leave a show and go, 'That was the most rockin' show I've ever seen.' I hope people can just roll with me a little bit - you know?","Sometimes people don't know what is behind the words they use. But an innocent little remark at school can affect you later in life.","I was lucky to move around different cultures at an early age and have experience of different lifestyles.","Racism is one of the worst forms of torture because it's directed at something you never asked for and something you can't change.","I've never had anything as formal as vocal lessons.","I learned to sing from my mum and dad's record collection.","As a kid, I loved to sing along to the Drifters and Otis Redding.","I don't mind being criticised, but hearing yourself described as the next James Blunt - that hurts.","The people I admire are Tim Buckley and John Martyn - singers that grew into themselves and were honest. John Martyn is one of the great soul singers because soul is not a genre; it's a feeling."],"Paolo Sorrentino":["The fear of old age is something that one feels when they're younger. Once you get to being old, you're already there, so you don't even think about it anymore.","There are contemporary artists that I hate with all my heart. These are provocateurs that are without feeling. Where is the real emotion?","I think cinema has this beautiful component. It's a universal language.","The way I work with my cinematographer is not based on general principles, but the ideas are triggered by the locations where we shoot.","There's one thing that I like about Rome that was stated by Napoleon: that from sublime to pathetic is only one step away. And in Rome there's a constant shifting between sublime and pathetic.","I hibernate. I hibernate until the next project takes shape in my mind.","I don't use Twitter. I'm a serious person.","What I find compelling is the moment in which people realize, with suffering and pain, that in the past there was a time when they were happy, because back then the present and the future coincided - they were one and the same thing.","Wasting time is something that people do or feel all over the world, not just in Italy.","What I'm interested in is human beings alone.","I have learned that I will not pay any attention to anything people say about my movies, because people say things that are all over the place.","Going around Rome, you can find beauty because, quite simply, Rome is very beautiful. But the beauty of the people is sometimes harder to discover.","I usually don't say anything to the actors. It works better for me because when they come to the set, they are at the same time scared and excited because they are not well aware of what will happen.","Rome is a city I love very much. I have lived there since I was a child.","I do read a lot. I read more than I watch movies.","I watch a lot of football.","Rome is a city where in every corner you have a reminder of the sacred world. That's why I have sacred music, minimalist sacred music, which is also music I like, because at the end of the day, that's what I want to do.","The thing is, even though you think a lot about your movie, and there's a lot of preparation behind it, the final end result completely goes beyond it. It's not something you're aware of."],"Paracelsus":["Medicine is not only a science; it is also an art. It does not consist of compounding pills and plasters; it deals with the very processes of life, which must be understood before they may be guided.","Poison is in everything, and no thing is without poison. The dosage makes it either a poison or a remedy.","The art of healing comes from nature, not from the physician. Therefore the physician must start from nature, with an open mind.","Medicine rests upon four pillars - philosophy, astronomy, alchemy, and ethics.","The dreams which reveal the supernatural are promises and messages that God sends us directly: they are nothing but His angels, His ministering spirits, who usually appear to us when we are in a great predicament.","Once a disease has entered the body, all parts which are healthy must fight it: not one alone, but all. Because a disease might mean their common death. Nature knows this; and Nature attacks the disease with whatever help she can muster.","The dose makes the poison.","Man is a microcosm, or a little world, because he is an extract from all the stars and planets of the whole firmament, from the earth and the elements; and so he is their quintessence.","However, anyone to whom this happens should not leave his room upon awakening, should speak to no-one, but remain alone and sober until everything comes back to him, and he recalls the dream.","Nature also forges man, now a gold man, now a silver man, now a fig man, now a bean man.","Dreams are not without meaning wherever thay may come from-from fantasy, from the elements, or from other inspiration.","For one country is different from another; its earth is different, as are its stones, wines, bread, meat, and everything that grows and thrives in a specific region.","Often the remedy is deemed the highest good because it helps so many.","Many have said of Alchemy, that it is for the making of gold and silver. For me such is not the aim, but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines.","Dreams must be heeded and accepted. For a great many of them come true.","If we want to make a statement about a man's nature on the basis of his physiognomy, we must take everything into account; it is in his distress that a man is tested, for then his nature is revealed.","The interpretation of dreams is a great art.","What the eyes perceive in herbs or stones or trees is not yet a remedy; the eyes see only the dross.","Thoughts create a new heaven, a new firmament, a new source of energy, from which new arts flow.","We do not know it because we are fooling away our time with outward and perishing things, and are asleep in regard to that which is real within ourself.","The physician must give heed to the region in which the patient lives, that is to say, to its type and peculiarities.","What sense would it make or what would it benfit a physician if he discovered the origin of the diseases but could not cure or alleviate them?","A mortal lives not through that breath that flows in and that flows out. The source of his life is another and this causes the breath to flow.","Although Alchemy has now fallen into contempt, and is even considered a thing of the past, the physicain should not be influenced by such judgements.","But is not He who created it for the sake of the sick body more than the remedy? And is not He who cures the soul, which is more than the body, greater?","For it is we who must pray for our daily bread, and if He grants it to us, it is only through our labour, our skill and preparation.","From time immemorial artistic insights have been revealed to artists in their sleep and in dreams, so that at all times they ardently desired them.","Life is like music, it must be composed by ear, feeling and instinct, not by rule. Nevertheless one had better know the rules, for they sometimes guide in doubtful cases, though not often.","This is alchemy, and this is the office of Vulcan; he is the apothecary and chemist of the medicine.","When a man undertakes to create something, he establishes a new heaven, as it were, and from it the work that he desires to create flows into him... For such is the immensity of man that he is greater than heaven and earth.","This process is alchemy: its founder is the smith Vulcan."],"Paramahansa Yogananda":["Let my soul smile through my heart and my heart smile through my eyes, that I may scatter rich smiles in sad hearts.","Remain calm, serene, always in command of yourself. You will then find out how easy it is to get along.","There is a magnet in your heart that will attract true friends. That magnet is unselfishness, thinking of others first; when you learn to live for others, they will live for you.","The season of failure is the best time for sowing the seeds of success.","Introspection, or 'sitting in the silence,' is an unscientific way of trying to force apart the mind and senses, tied together by the life force. The contemplative mind, attempting its return to divinity, is constantly dragged back toward the senses by the life currents.","Ignoring all prejudices of caste, creed, class, color, sex, or race, a swami follows the precepts of human brotherhood. His goal is absolute unity with Spirit.","Many great works of art, poetry, and music are inspired by astral memories. The desire to do noble, beautiful things here on Earth is also often a carryover of astral experiences between a person's earth lives.","The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others.","This life is not man's own show; if he becomes personally and emotionally involved in the very complicated cosmic drama, he reaps inevitable suffering for having distorted the divine 'plot.'","When the yogi starts to meditate, he must leave behind all sensory thoughts and all longings for possessions by quieting the waves of feeling (chitta), and the mental restlessness that arises therefrom, through the application of techniques that reinstate the controlling power of the untrammeled superconsciousness of the soul.","The physical ego, the active consciousness in man, should uplift its body-identified self into unity with the soul, its true nature; it should not allow itself to remain mired in the lowly delusive strata of the senses and material entanglement.","Truth is exact correspondence with reality.","Only the wise know just where predestination ends and free will begins. Meanwhile, you must keep on doing your best, according to your own clearest understanding. you must long for freedom as the drowning man longs for air. Without sincere longing, you will never find God.","Man is important in one sense only. He was made in the image of God: That is his importance. He is not important for his body, ego, or personality. His constant affirmation of ego-consciousness is the source of all his problems.","When your mind is fully withdrawn in superconsciousness, it becomes centered in the bliss of the spine. You are then in your ideational, or causal, body. That is the level of the soul.","Yoga is a method for restraining the natural turbulence of thoughts, which otherwise impartially prevent all men, of all lands, from glimpsing their true nature of Spirit. Yoga cannot know a barrier of East and West any more than does the healing and equitable light of the sun.","Everything, at first, is an idea, a special creation.","The Western day is indeed nearing when the inner science of self-control will be found as necessary as the outer conquest of nature. This new Atomic Age will see men's minds sobered and broadened by the now scientifically indisputable truth that matter is in reality a concentrate of energy.","Whoever comes to me finds me a mirror to whatever is in his heart. Thus, I try to help him to see qualities in himself that he needs to overcome.","Cosmic energy enters the body through the medulla and then passes to the cerebrum, in which it is stored or concentrated.","To allot God a secondary place in life was, to me, inconceivable. Though He is the sole Owner of the cosmos, silently showering us with gifts from life to life, one thing yet remains which He does not own, and which each human heart is empowered to withhold or bestow - man's love.","The man form is higher than the angel form; of all forms it is the highest. Man is the highest being in creation, because he aspires to freedom.","My keen love of travel was seldom hindered by Father. He permitted me, even as a mere boy, to visit many cities and pilgrimage spots.","The ideal of an all-sided education for youth had always been close to my heart. I saw clearly the arid results of ordinary instruction, aimed only at the development of body and intellect.","It is wisest to be impartial. If you have health, but are attached to it, you will always be afraid of losing it. And if you fear that loss, but become ill, you will suffer. Why not remain forever joyful in the Self?","Sri Yukteswar showed no special consideration to those who happened to be powerful or accomplished; neither did he slight others for their poverty or illiteracy. He would listen respectfully to words of truth from a child, and openly ignore a conceited pundit.","The physical ego serves as its own worst enemy when, by delusive material behavior, it eclipses its true nature as the ever blessed soul.","As often as you fail, get up and try again. God will never let you down, so long as you don't let Him down, and so long as you make the effort.","All honest work is good work; it is capable of leading to self-development, provided the doer seeks to discover the inherent lessons and makes the most of the potentialities for such growth.","The Creator, in taking infinite pains to shroud with mystery His presence in every atom of creation, could have had but one motive - a sensitive desire that men seek Him only through free will.","If one marries out of necessity, he will have to reincarnate to reach the point where he wants to live only for God.","The yogi offers his labyrinthine human longings to a monotheistic bonfire dedicated to the unparalleled God. This is indeed the true yogic fire ceremony, in which all past and present desires are fuel consumed by love divine.","The sense of being a separate, egoic self begins with the astral, not with the physical, body. The soul is individualized spirit.","Careless indifference and bodily restlessness in meditation cause negative vibrations.","I find my earliest memories covering the anachronistic features of a previous incarnation. Clear recollections came to me of a distant life, a yogi amidst the Himalayan snows. These glimpses of the past, by some dimensionless link, also afforded me a glimpse of the future.","The yogi should meditate on a firm seat, one that is clean - untainted by dirt or unspiritual vibrations of others. The thought or life force emanating from an individual saturates the objects he uses and his dwelling.","There are always two forces warring against each other within us.","Hypnotism is trespass into the territory of another's consciousness. Its temporary phenomena have nothing in common with the miracles performed by men of divine realization.","The ordinary man considers solids and liquids and the energy manifestations of the material world to be vastly different, but the yogi sees them as various vibrations of the one cosmic light.","A swami may conceivably follow only the path of dry reasoning, of cold renunciation; but a yogi engages himself in a definite, step-by-step procedure by which the body and mind are disciplined, and the soul liberated.","No one can be a yogi, maintaining a state of mental equilibrium, free from inner involvement in planned desireful activities, unless he has renounced identification with his ego and its unsatisfiable lust for the fruits of actions.","A true yogi may remain dutifully in the world; there, he is like butter on water and not like the easily-diluted milk of unchurned and undisciplined humanity.","The man who has perceived God looks upon all types of men as dream motion-picture images, made of the relativities of the light of Cosmic Consciousness and the shadows of delusion."],"Pardis Sabeti":["Let us not let the world be defined by the destruction wrought by one virus, but illuminated by billions of hearts and minds working in unity.","As long as I have a heartbeat, I'm fine. So I just do what I love, and I do it the best that I can. And if it all goes away, I'll just start over.","The creative scientific process is - It's kind of - It's a windy road that has a trajectory, but it's a slow trajectory.","My kind of, like, life goal is to help train students to be good people as well as good scientists. That would be my dream.","Especially working in infectious disease, it's very interesting because these infectious diseases, these agents, they evolve over time. So it's very much an arms race and understanding how each changes to protect itself and to continue. And so it's very much this puzzle-solving but with this great urgency and importance in what you find.","Over the years, we settled into American life and embraced it fully. But having come from a different culture, I didn't know the boundaries of American culture. Which is that, as a girl, you didn't play football or soccer at lunch with the boys, and to be cool, you didn't get into math Olympiad.","I like - I love calculus. I love linear algebra, probability and statistics, that kind of stuff. I just really like that.","My father took one of the toughest jobs in the government because he cared about his nation more than himself. His courage and conviction have always driven me to want to make a difference.","My sister taught me addition and subtraction and multiplication and division, so by the time I got to school, I knew it all, and when we'd do the times tables, I was just focused on doing it faster than anybody else. I already had the information, so it just got me to focus on excellence.","See, Ebola, like all threats to humanity, it's fueled by mistrust and distraction and division. When we build barriers amongst ourselves, and we fight amongst ourselves, the virus thrives. But unlike all threats to humanity, Ebola is one where we're actually all the same. We're all in this fight together.","My family fled Iran in October 1978 as a result of the coming revolution when I was two years old. In the early days, my entire family lived together in a very crowded house, where I shared a room with my sister, cousin, and grandmother, and we would all listen to my grandmother tell stories before bedtime.","The Ebola epidemic was the most frightening outbreak I have witnessed in my lifetime, and I believe it was necessary to react globally as strongly as we did.","I am deeply immersed in my medical work, and it can get very intense, but I believe that the connection and devotion is key. You can not work on diseases as devastating and deadly as Lassa and Ebola without complete trust and respect for the individuals with whom you work. My lab and colleagues are just extraordinary, and we are a family.","I'm looking for all the things that are beneficial in the human genome. Everything that I do is based on a very simple principle: things that are beneficial will spread through populations very quickly.","You get these moments of thrill. There you are, at 3:00 in the morning, and you know something about how we evolved that nobody else in the world knows. It's a thrill of discovery. You make this breakthrough, and you find something. It's this wonderful, wonderful scavenger hunt when you got to the end. It's just so great to be a scientist.","Had I to do it again, I would have been a math major, probably a double major, and did take a lot of math classes, but I would have taken a lot more.","It's just difficult to see that people want to be like the actors and the performers and the politicians who are - who they see all the time, but the people that are probably having the most fun are the writers and the directors and the producers and the scientists, right, the people in the back that are getting to do the creative process.","I don't really love to perform in music. Some people like it more, but it's not my thing so much, but just the writing, when you get the lyric, and the lyric just goes just the right way, or you find the right bridge that takes you to the solo, and those moments are tremendous, and it's difficult to portray.","I was actually not some sort of a child prodigy by any stretch.","There is - I will just say that there was a disastrous day where I discovered really what radioactivity is and that just because you don't see it doesn't mean that it's not everywhere, so - Yeah. I was a slow learner for sure.","The process of discovery in my field is very incremental. But there are moments when you realize you know something about the world nobody else knows. That's extraordinarily exhilarating.","So much of the physical world has been explored. But the deluge of data I get to investigate really lets me chart new territory. Genetic data from people living today forms an archaeological record of what happened to their ancestors 10,000 years ago.","Most of my work may happen at a computer, but it's still a new and very exciting frontier.","When I was working on my Ph.D., I developed a computer algorithm to look for rapid changes in populations' DNA. Our DNA changes constantly over generations, but if certain changes spread through a population more quickly than others, they are probably the beneficial results of natural selection. This is the protection we give ourselves to survive.","If there's a trait for not sleeping, I probably have it.","The great thing about America is I've never felt like an outsider. I'm just a different piece of the puzzle.","There are so many aspects to science that I couldn't give up - the rigor, the discoveries, the teaching. The impact that science has on the world around us is something I'm enthralled with. I don't think anyone could ever take that out of me.","My scientific work is much more practically minded - to change something, to effect something. And the music I do is much more soft power, about changing minds.","Generally, I'm not writing about genomes or anything like that. But people underestimate the creativity you use in science and the rigor you need in music. They basically have the same path.","I think I first encountered Ebola from the movie 'Outbreak.' Then there was the book 'The Hot Zone.' It's the type of thing you either read and say, 'Oh wow, that's terrifying,' or you read it and say, 'Oh wow, I want to do that.' I read it and said, 'Oh wow, I want do that.'","At 9, I think I had really gotten into tennis. I liked writing short stories; I loved solving math problems. I was learning a little piano, and I was collecting Garbage Pail Kids cards.","I sometimes try to think of my life as an Iranian, and it is hard to imagine. I am grateful for the life I have had in America and all the amazing opportunities and experiences it has given me. But there is a spirit in Iranians I can see that is unbounded by geography.","I have a B.S. in Biology from MIT, an M.Sc. in Human Biology and a Ph.D. in Biological Anthropology from Oxford University, and an M.D. from Harvard Medical School. I never intended for so many degrees, but I enjoyed getting them all.","It is of course very difficult to see relations between America and Iran becoming increasingly tense and knowing that it is not the people of the countries but a subset of leaders and radicals that are causing such strife. I am hoping that the spirit of the people will triumph.","I heard it in 2008 and hear it again now - this notion that the only reason one would support Hillary Clinton is because she is a woman - or only because she is experienced and smart. She is all of those things. But I am with her because... Hillary Clinton inspires me.","Unlike some viruses, we don't know what the natural reservoir is for Ebola. A lot of people think it's bats, but it's still very controversial; it could have been circulating in insects, in an environment, or in individuals."],"Paris Hilton":["The only rule is don't be boring and dress cute wherever you go. Life is too short to blend in.","No matter what a woman looks like, if she's confident, she's sexy.","Some girls are just born with glitter in their veins.","Some people change when they think they're a star or something.","The way I see it, you should live everyday like its your birthday.","There's nobody in the world like me. I think every decade has an iconic blonde, like Marilyn Monroe or Princess Diana and, right now, I'm that icon.","I hate the taste of alcohol. When I'm drinking, I'm drinking Red Bull.","Life is too short to blend in.","I think it's important for girls to be confident. Believe in yourself and... everybody's hot.","I'm not the same person I was. I used to act dumb. It was an act. I am 26 years old, and that act is no longer cute. It is not who I am, nor do I want to be that person for the young girls who looked up to me. I know now that I can make a difference, that I have the power to do that.","I'd imagine my wedding as a fairy tale... huge, beautiful and white.","I always knew I had a voice and I've always known I could sing, but I was too shy to let it come out. I think it's the hardest thing to do, to sing in front of people. When I finally let go and did it, I realized it's what I'm most talented at and what I love to do the most.","I've made all my money on my own without my family and I work very hard.","Wal-mart... do they like make walls there?","First I wanted to be a veterinarian. And then I realized you had to give them shots to put them to sleep, so I decided I'd just buy a bunch of animals and have them in my house instead.","Every woman should have four pets in her life. A mink in her closet, a jaguar in her garage, a tiger in her bed, and a jackass who pays for everything.","I'm blonde and tanned and normal-sized! I'm sweet, shy, funny, have a big heart and I'm nice - and I like to eat.","I don't really think, I just walk.","I get along with guys; most of my friends are guys. It's easier to trust men sometimes. I only have a few close girlfriends that I trust.","What's a soup kitchen?","You don't have to be an heiress to look like one, if you act like one then everyone will just presume you are one.","I hate when a guy brags... or he sweats.","By channeling my inner heiress, I created a new opportunity for young heiresses.","I really don't like going out anymore. I used to love it, but now it's not fun. I'd rather have friends come over and hot have to worry about crazy people taking pictures.","One night stands are not for me. I think it's gross when you just give it up.","I'm very intelligent. I'm capable of doing everything put to me. I've launched a perfume and want my own hotel chain. I'm living proof blondes are not stupid.","I get half a million just to show up at parties. My life is, like, really, really fun.","I travel around the world constantly promoting my projects and endorsing products. Yes, I do get paid to go to parties; in fact, I'm the person who started the whole trend of paid appearances. But when you see me at a party, I'm always working or promoting something.","When I was younger, my family would go camping and fishing on our ranches. My dad loves being around all kinds of animals. He's the one who got me to be a really big animal lover.","That's hot.","I don't want to be known as the granddaughter of the Hiltons. I want to be known as Paris.","I love Africa in general South Africa and West Africa, they are both great countries.","I don't like parties past 2 am. Then it's all losers and weirdos.","Yes, I've kissed a lot of guys. I like to kiss, but that's it. I don't go home with anyone. I sleep with my animals, like my baby monkey, Brigitte Bardot.","It's been my dream to have four babies by 30. I look after animals, so I'd have a lot to give my kids.","I take my dog Tinkerbell seriously. I take my job seriously. But I don't take myself all that seriously.","I'm the nicest, most loyal person in the world when it comes to my friends.","I'm not a kid anymore. And I'm excited for all the amazing things to come.","I'm the kind of person who, if I see a shooting star, I wouldn't stay there and watch it. I'd run to my friends and tell them because I would want everyone to see it too.","It will work. I am a marketing genius.","It's traditional for an heiress to be raised in a sheltered way. No one thinks that's true of me, but it actually was.","When Paris has to pee, Paris has to pee!","This is Earth. Isn't it hot?","A true heiress is never mean to anyone - except a girl who steals your boyfriend.","All British people have plain names, and that works pretty well over there.","I like it, but it's yellow, and I'm like, I didn't want yellow for my engagement ring.","I don't want to be known as the Hilton heiress, because I didn't do anything for that.","The Backstreet Boys were so ten years ago. Whatever.","I have been celibate for about six or seven months, I think. I would rather just make out and kiss someone instead of sex. I'm single. I said I would be single for a year and I am.","All it takes is one drink to mess with the way you drive - it clouds your judgment and slows your reflexes. Don't take any chances. It just isn't worth it.","Everything I do is blown out of proportion. It really hurts my feelings.","I talk in that baby talk voice when I'm on TV, it's a put on.","I don't think there's ever been anyone like me that's lasted. And I'm going to keep on lasting.","My kitchen looks like the one from my childhood - very homey, with a little bit of Alice in Wonderland!","Being grown up and in a serious relationship, I've learned so much. I'm happier than I've every been.","My mom decorated with lots of antiques. I never liked it when I was a little girl - I wanted to live in a modern house. But now I love it."],"Paris Jackson":["I love my dad, and I'm proud to be his daughter.","I know my dad always wanted to heal the world, and so I think it would be great to follow in his footsteps.","There are a lot of bad people out there.","I have lots of memories of my father. He was an incredible father. We all loved him to death.","Now I see other kids and their parents, and I compare them to my dad. Our dad was a really normal father when he was with us. We would get grounded if we did something bad. He would ground us. He wouldn't call it grounding; he'd just say, 'You're on punishment.' Sometimes we'd be on punishment a lot.","I want to help people. That's it.","I do have a regular childhood.","I want to have a normal high-school experience.","My dad was in the movie 'Moonwalker,' and I knew he could sing really well, but I didn't know he could act. I saw that, and I said, 'Wow, I want to be just like him.'","I just don't think the title 'MJ's daughter' fits me.","Some people try to cyber bully me; they try to get to me with words, but that doesn't really work.","I listen to older music like AC/DC.","Ever since I was born, Daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine. And I just want to say that I love him so much.","I didn't get why I was wearing a mask. But I understand it now - why my dad would want our face to be covered.","A lot of people don't like me.","You can be, like, a totally different person on camera, and it's fun. You can take on another character, and it's awesome.","I want to be my own person.","A ton of kids at school have made fun of me; if I had to give advice to other girls, I would say, 'Hang loose and ignore them. They shouldn't faze you no matter how popular they think they are.'"],"Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson":["They always say, 'Time heals.' But it really doesn't. You just get used to it. I live life with the mentality of 'OK, I lost the only thing that has ever been important to me.' So going forward, anything bad that happens can't be nearly as bad as what happened before.","I've had self-esteem issues for a really, really long time. Plenty of people think I'm ugly, and plenty of people don't. But there's a moment when I'm modeling where I forget about my self-esteem issues and focus on what the photographer's telling me - and I feel pretty. And in that sense, it's selfish.","I have lots of memories of my father. He was an incredible father. We all loved him to death. He'd try to educate us as much as he could and was always looking out for us. He was very protective.","I never met anyone before who made me feel the way music makes me feel.","The whole freedom-of-speech thing is great. But I don't think that our Founding Fathers predicted social media when they created all of these amendments and stuff.","I consider myself black.","I've had a lot of mother figures. But by the time my mom came into my life, it wasn't a 'mommy' thing. It's more of an adult relationship.","I want to have a normal high-school experience.","I want to help people; that's it.","I'd like to be an actress when I'm older. I sometimes do improv. I used to do it with my dad.","I originally wanted to be an astronaut when I was a kid. Then I had this huge fear of black holes because my brother learned a bunch of stuff about it, and he's like, 'Oh, yeah, if you go into one you're never coming back.'","I do have, like, a regular childhood. I mean, I'm treated the same.","My dad was in the movie 'Moonwalker,' and I knew he could sing really well, but I didn't know he could act. I saw that, and I said, 'Wow. I want to be just like him.'"],"Park Bo-gum":["When I'm not in front of the camera, I'm just like any other normal person. I'm a student. I eat when I'm stressed.","I just try to stay focused and show the goodness in me to people.","Ultimately, I want to be a good person and spread happiness through my acting. If I don't forget to be appreciative and thankful, then that would be the most important thing that I'll ever achieve.","Chuseok is coming soon, and I hope you spend a good time with your family. You can spend Chuseok with 'Moonlight Drawn by Clouds' as well.","As soon as I saw the script for 'Moonlight Drawn By Clouds,' I thought it was fun, and I really wanted to do it.","It's not the moment yet for me to enjoy my time as an actor, and as the time goes by, I feel that I need to push myself harder to pay back for all the good fortune that I have received.","When I was young, I really wanted to be a part of the end-of-year awards shows, but now that I'm actually there, it feels weird. I used to go to church and ended the year with a prayer, but now I spend it with people I'm not very familiar with at an award show, and I wonder if it's something I should be doing.","I don't think it's good to interact with people with a certain agenda in mind.","The most important thing to me is facing people head on and focusing on not disappointing the public.","Most superhero characters we see these days are from foreign countries. I would like to play a superhero that shows off Korean power.","I can't take the subway anymore. I think I can still take the bus, though. It's a double-edged sword because I'm grateful that people recognize and support me, but there are definite downsides to that.","Before, I could meet and greet all my fans one by one, but now, it's hard to remember all of their names. And my actions can sometimes cause misunderstandings. If I bow to one side, I've heard people from the other side ask why I didn't bow there.","My original dream was to become a singer-songwriter, so I sent a video of myself playing the piano and singing to all the big agencies.","I am grateful for all the moments that I have, and I'm moving forward one step at a time to the future.","I think I like those who feel comfortable like a friend and also take good care of me like a mother.","My stylist and agency staff are the ones that do a good job telling me what to wear.","Currently, I work as an actor, but I still love music.","I did not have activities in the Philippines before, but many fans recognized me and greeted me with overflowing cheers. 'Moonlight Drawn by Clouds' was said to have aired through KBS World. I didn't know that.","The subway is best to take when I have to meet someone. With just 1,300 won, I can go anywhere in Seoul!","If I were to have the opportunity to work with Joong Ki, playing brothers would be good, but anything would be great as long as it was with Joong Ki.","My father said, '10 minus one is zero.' It means that even if you do good things 10 times, it is no use when you do some bad thing once. But it doesn't mean that I think I have positive image, so I always need to be careful about what I'm doing. I don't want to frame myself.","I just want to be more willing to listen to many people and be cautious about what I'm doing.","I want to wear school uniforms. I want to do something like the movie 'Our Times.'","I learned playing cello in 'Cantabile' and Go in 'Reply 1988.' In 'Moonlight Drawn by Clouds,' I learned horse riding and Geomungo. It's fun to learn new things.","I have not forgotten about my dreams to become a singer. If given the chance, I want to take part in a drama OST making and also try out for musicals."],"Park Chan-wook":["The reason I want to show shocking things is that they always pose an ethical question.","Becoming a vampire means completely changing your identity.","When you first hear Mozart's music, your first impression is that it's very alive, but if you peel away the layers, you can hear sorrow and sadness behind it, and that's what I try to be: multi-layered.","If your work requires you to travel, you will understand that there's no vacation destination like home.","A film set is a workplace for me; it's my office, and nobody really wants to be in a stressful work environment.","A priest encounters temptation every day, and some of that desire is very natural.","The point of revenge is not in the completion but in the process.","Whether it's trivial or important, every choice has a moral aspect to it to a certain degree.","I am not going to do a film based on a bad scenario just to make a big Hollywood film or work with Hollywood stars.","Certain subjects may no longer be taboo in cinema. But there are ways to treat them that still create shock.","There's a humble beauty about listening to period instruments that I like.","When we are confronted with extreme situations, we forget about moral issues; we simply act and must then accept the consequences.","When I was going through puberty, I had all these feelings of being unstable through those years, and being uncontrollably drawn to things of beauty and things that are bad.","When I was growing up, we were taught in school that North Koreans, and especially the North Korean leadership, were all devils.","Lots of people think the violence in the films I make is overwhelming, but they think they're seeing something that they aren't seeing.","I guess I probably make violent films partly because I can't express my anger in my real life very well.","The atmosphere of Catholicism in Korea is quite different to the way it is practised and perceived in Europe or the U.S.","I'd like to do a really masculine film.","I'd love to do a sci-fi movie, a western, or an espionage thriller. But I'm not going to limit myself. If a good script comes along, I'm not going to discount it because it doesn't fit into one of these genres.","I've read all of Sarah Waters's novels which have been translated into Korean.","Whenever I visit a city, I like to see what classical music concerts are on offer.","I don't usually watch a lot of TV, but 'Mad Men' changed my perspective. I admire Matthew Weiner who came up with the idea and wrote such a great TV series, and the broadcasting company for being bold enough to air such a series.","When I grow older and less popular, there will come a time when I have to shoot films on low budgets.","I grew up in a very Catholic family. Up until puberty, I would go to a Catholic church every week.","When you consider the concept of vampirism, it is inherently part of a Western culture.","I hate jeans for no reason.","If I want to relax and not do anything, I don't want to leave home.","I live in a rural residential area. It's a great place for a walk. I'm at my happiest when I'm listening to my iPod while walking around where my feet take me.","Actors, I think, are all the same. Both Korean actors and American actors are all very sensitive people, and they are all curious to know what the director thinks of them and how they are evaluated, and they try to satisfy the director. And they like it if you listen carefully to their opinions and accept them.","Visual elements are, of course, the director's job.","As I grow older I spend more time with my wife, and gradually my interest in the woman's world is growing.","When I was making my first films, I was very interested in Hollywood B movies.","When I say that I am going to do an American film, I didn't want to suddenly go off into a completely different world that which bears no relation to the style of filmmaking that I'm used to.","I have always meticulously storyboarded my films from beginning to end.","All of the characters in my films, they share one commonality. It doesn't matter whether they are good or bad, it doesn't matter whether they are smart or stupid, these characters all take responsibility for their own behavior. I'm much the same.","It is not possible for a person to be completely free of sin and be squeaky clean.","I became a film director, but I wasn't successful with my first couple of films, so I had to turn to becoming a film critic to make a living.","People who really try to be conscious of what they have done, who take responsibility, to me these kinds of people are heroes.","I've always had an interest in vampire films - not just 'Nosferatu,' but there are many others that I have enjoyed: Abel Ferrara, Coppola, Neil Jordan.","When it comes to remaking my own films in the English language, I can only imagine that it is a very boring process, I wouldn't ever dream of it.","I love Philip Glass' work, not only as a film composer but also as a musician. The film score work that he does always amazes and shocks me.","If you would ask me what my ideal process is, I would say, long pre-production, long production and long post-production.","I am sure I am one of 2,000 film directors in the world that Tarantino admires.","In our lives, we have good things and bad things, happiness and pain.","Living without hate for people is almost impossible.","In my opinion, all relationships between people have some sort of violence, and it is central.","I'm not the kind of director who aims to send a message out.","I don't think I've ever tried to make something happen that I've absolutely had to force. You know how they say: if you can't avoid it, enjoy it. For me, it's the other way around: if I can't enjoy it, I avoid it.","I do like musical films more than big Hollywood films, especially those by Jacques Demi and Vincent Minelli.","I don't really believe in the auteur theory.","I believe 'love' is very nice to hear, but it's used so much that it's come to a point where it's almost meaningless.","I believe there are more films that involve love and forgiveness than violence, but they often seem fake and are almost embarrassing to watch.","I cannot believe that violence depicted onscreen actually causes people to act out violently. That's oversimplifying the issue. If somebody commits a violent act after seeing violence in a movie, I think the question that needs to be asked is: would that person still have committed the act if he had not seen a violent film?"],"Park Chung-hee":["We must do our part to end poverty in Korea so that the next generation doesn't experience what we are going through now.","Koreans stuck to their traditional way of life without knowing what was going on outside the country. We were like frogs in a well.","I have repeatedly emphasized that the Communists in North Korea appear to have set 1975 as the year of aggression against the South.","How can a country like Korea, which was not fully prepared for the upcoming era, be as rich as Germany now?","If the North Korean Communists provoke another war, we must immediately deter it and give them a decisive counterattack at the initial place of aggression."],"Park Geun-hye":["All facts prove that the Saenuri Party is a group of traitors who stoop to any infamy to realize its ambition to seize power.","I will end the history of division and conflict through reconciliation and fairness.","Different times need different types of leadership.","Big businesses aren't the only ones in the economic ecosystem. Nobody should fall behind because of an unfair structure.","In human life, economics precedes politics or culture.","I will be the president of the nation who keeps pledges.","I understand that the end does not justify the means. And this should be a lasting value for democracy.","I couldn't stand back and watch the strong economy that my father envisioned go to ruins.","My father was criticized as a dictator, but that should not overshadow his accomplishments in restructuring the country. He brought Korea out of 5,000 years of poverty. What he left unaccomplished was democratization of the system.","We need fundamental change. In the past, national development led to people's happiness but now the link between national growth and improvement in people's lives has been severed.","I will open an era of grand national unity.","National partition is a sorrow that touches all Koreans, but for me it is brought to the fore by unimaginable personal suffering.","I will revive the legend of the economic miracle, making the country a place where people have no worry about living and young people merrily go to work.","I want to be judged on my own merits.","I know more than anyone the divergent views about my father.","I believe that it is an unchanging value of democracy that ends cannot justify the means in politics.","I have no family to take care of and no children to pass wealth to.","I will never forget the will of the people who believed in me wherever I went during the election campaign.","My father's biggest achievement was to motivate the South Korean people, to show them we could become prosperous if we worked hard. He taught me to love my country, and serve my country.","I have no family to take care of.","I have no child to inherit my properties. You, the people, are my only family, and to make you happy is the reason I do politics.","I know more than anyone the divergent views about my father. I want to be judged on my own merits.","I will keep the promise I made to you to open a new era on the Korean peninsula, based on strong security and trust-based diplomacy.","South Korea's economy is still difficult. I will create a country where nobody worries about putting food on the table.","I will try to work for greater reconciliation, cooperation and peace in North East Asia based on correct perception of history.","Various channels of dialogue must be kept open to build trust. I will meet North Korea's leader if it is needed to develop relations between the two Koreas.","We should change the current economic system dominated by big business groups to a one where small and medium-sized enterprises develop together."],"Park Shin-hye":["Less make-up is better, and it's always better to let your natural beauty shine. Essentially, be happy with your appearance.","While make-up helps to enhance one's features, too much of it tends to hide a person's features.","I am not a slim person, so I regularly exercise to be healthy mentally and physically.","I used to like humorous people in the past, but these days, I like serious people more.","If somebody has too much stress about their appearance, they can overcome their inferiority complex through surgery.","Due to my hectic work schedule, I hardly have enough sleep, and my skin tends to look dull. Facial masks are my savior, as it helps to brighten and hydrate my skin.","My face is not perfect. Because my nose is not sharp, many people suggested I should get my nose done.","I don't think badly of or oppose having plastic surgery. I once seriously thought of it, but I decided to take my appearance as it is.","I want to marry after traveling alone, meeting many people, and experiencing a variety of things, and when I'm certain I can be responsible of myself.","When I was younger, I wanted to marry early, like at 23. Year by year, I found things I wanted to do, and the thought of marriage disappeared. But I don't want to marry too late. Around 31?","Jung Yong-hwa and I know so much about each other, I think it would be difficult for us to start a romantic relationship.","I wanted to get some nose job, because I don't like how my nose tip looks. My hand is also not as pretty, especially my thumb nails. Many people told me that I have ugly hands.","Quite many people have ugly hands, and I thought I should not feel ashamed about it.","In the past, I used to tell everyone that I have never had a boyfriend, because I was still quite young. However, I cannot say the same thing now.","Of course I have had a boyfriend. However, I was way too busy while taking care of myself, and I could not show a better care for my boyfriend. I found myself getting more and more egocentric, and I was not a good girlfriend at all.","I cannot believe that 'Pinocchio' is over yet, and I always think about so many great memories that I made while playing in the drama.","I was going to finish my university degree after finishing 'The Tailors,' but 'Pinocchio' made me to take another semester off.","Many fans were surprised when they learned that the little girl in drama 'Stairway To Heaven' was me.","I actually felt like I was starting a new career as a news reporter while playing in 'Pinocchio.'","Unlike my previous roles, which portrayed girls who are supportive and loving, Hye-jung is a cold loner who doesn't know how to love."],"Parker Conrad":["I was spending all my time at the 'Crimson' - like, 70 hours a week - and I didn't go to class for, like, a year. I failed out of school. I had to leave Harvard, really, halfway through my tenure as the 'Crimson' managing editor. It was this incredibly humiliating and shocking experience.","At Wikinvest, which got renamed Sigfig, we were constantly just two or three months away from not being able to make payroll.","There's a lot of just administrative work that comes along with having employees.","The only thing I learned is that failure sucks, and you never want to do it. There's not a lot to be said for that particular lesson.","Some days you're the fire hydrant, and some days you're the dog.","I'm not going to run my business on the basis of quarterly numbers.","The way we designed self-driving payroll, it ends payroll as an independent system that you're entering information in by hand.","It feels good to have people who support you and back you and believe in you.","There's nothing easy about building a company at all. I find it really hard, just painful and difficult, and if you are successful, it's even worse than if you fail.","I'm too old to understand Snapchat.","I'll grab coffee with my wife and daughter and then am in the office around 9 or 10. From there, I usually have about 8 hours of meetings.","When professors expect a few dozen students and hundreds show up, it's a mixed blessing. While it's a testament to their popularity, it also means they have to scramble to interview and hire more teaching fellows, schedule rooms, and order lab supplies.","If Harvard officials ban the microfridge, it will leave undergraduates without any cooking appliances at all allowed in their rooms.","A good headline is far more than a summary. It has to characterize, in a few brief words, the most important themes and news items of the article it accompanies.","One of the powers of a sit-in is its visibility and potential to mobilize public opinion; the way the protest is reported in the media can have a powerful influence over its eventual success or failure.","Media organizations are frequently criticized for a heartless approach to the news. Stories that are damaging to a person's reputation make the front page just as quickly - and many would say even more quickly - as stories that enhance it.","Journalists play God when they decide for their readers when to hide information from them. Frequently, those choices are unavoidable.","The Digital Millennium Copyright Act indemnifies Internet Service Providers (ISP) such as Harvard from copyright abuses committed over their computer networks.","College students typically receive marketing offers in the mail from upwards of a hundred companies each year.","Despite the volume of 'junk' mail that students receive each year, companies that have an interest in selling their product to students say direct mailing is a key to their success.","Both in the short-run and the long-run, college students, collectively, have enormous spending power.","Lists that segment people into clearly-defined categories are particularly valuable to direct marketers, which can tailor their sales pitch to a particular demographic and, therefore, increase the likelihood of making a sale.","The battle over Napster has divided musicians and industry officials.","There are those who say the music industry must adapt to a wired world. They point to the decades-long rise in CD prices, even as manufacturing costs came down, and to data that shows Napster may actually increase sales of CDs by music-hungry customers as evidence that the music industry is simply afraid of a new technology.","One of the lasting consequences of the unrest of the late 1960s was the removal of adult authority from the lives of undergraduates at many colleges. And, as a consequence, residential communities developed much as students themselves wanted them to.","I tried paying at a restaurant with stock options. It didn't work.","With a lot of the things that seem scalable, you will find bottlenecks you never imagined that you suddenly need to find solutions for.","It's a lot easier to figure out how to scale something that doesn't feel like it would scale than it is to figure out what is actually gonna work. You're much better off going after something that will work that doesn't scale, then trying to figure how to scale it up, than you are trying to figure it all out.","Rightly or wrongly, for better or worse, valuation is a very important tool for recruiting - particularly in the markets for software engineering, where the market is really tight.","I don't know anything about Amazon's culture; I've never worked there.","There is so much headache and hassle involved in starting a business or running a business.","Zenefits is basically a service that manages all of your payroll, benefits, and associated HR details that come along with those. Dealing with new employee onboarding, offer letters, and managing that - and we do it for free.","The reality is, for small businesses, there really aren't HR systems. Small businesses are rolling their own.","If you move or get married, that has to be changed with HR, payroll, medical insurance, life insurance, etc. It is a huge administrative headache that requires a full-time staff.","Insurance brokers make way too much money for the value they provide.","A lot of scaling up a company is not very sexy or strategic."],"Parker Harris":["I think the legacy is really the company that we built. That's what makes me happy. I'm a very simple person, so that's all I really need.","If you want a database, you don't go out and say you're going to write it. I see platforms as going in that direction.","What I'll take credit for is finding visionary people in the company, or bringing them in, and then empowering them to help me.","Social computing is doing what agile methodology is doing to our process - it's breaking down our visibility.","Diving into data has never been more critical for businesses in order to make fast, accurate decisions about customer behaviors and needs and drive holistic business knowledge.","My favourite moments at Dreamforce are when people come up and thank me randomly. It's a selfish time for me, as I get lots of positive feedback.","All business leaders need to be technologists, as every industry now has a Netflix or an Uber on the horizon, threatening to upend business as usual. Apps are driving this disruption, and every enterprise needs to become an app company.","We do a lot of outbound work where we're talking about the future. As we get involved with these new products, it helps us have a platform to talk about where the future is going.","Looking at the trends that we have gone through as a company, where we started the company, it's all about cloud computing, and we're still cloud computing. And then we went through this space on social. When Facebook came out, that was amazing.","I took a detour to France in my senior year in high school. So that's part of what ended up sending me, actually, to Middlebury because I went to school with people who were more from the Northeast.","I grew up in North Carolina. My father was a salesperson; he sold textiles.","I grew up loving computers and math, actually. I also loved English literature and French, but I became obsessed with computers when the Apple II was coming out.","I remember my school had some of the first Apple IIs in North Carolina. I remember, when I first started using them, we were using a cassette tape to store programs because we didn't have floppy disk drives.","By flattening time and space, social computing and business is unlocking credible potential within business. For example, individuals and organizations that weren't connected before are now connected together.","Those trying to get support for their iPhones don't necessary trust their carriers, so they ask their friends for help.","We are building technology to keep up with what's happening in the world. It's transforming the way people are working. We're bringing the enterprise to the world.","One of our first jobs was at Saba Software. We were helping them build their products for the cloud. We wanted to build our own product and move away from consulting. We were looking for a change. The CEO of Saba introduced me to Marc Benioff.","When you come to San Francisco, we want you to know where Salesforce is.","Where I'm focused now is how I get more women leaders. We decided not to just look outside the company for great women to hire, but to help women rise up through the ranks internally.","When we started, we thought about the scale of the Internet - if everyone was using the service at the same time, what would that look like?","I still believe heavily that we have to be careful about having this ego and hubris as a successful corporation, that we should do it all. Because then I think we start to fail our customers and we're too focused on taking over the world.","Many people have said we just need to add more products. Look at Oracle, look at SAP. Add ERP and inventory or compensation. Add all this stuff. What we realized is we're the customer company. We're the front office solution, and our customers would be really upset if we just added a whole bunch of stuff and lost focus.","Businesses can't afford to react to what their customers want; they need to anticipate their needs.","Wearable technology is not just for consumers. It creates a tremendous opportunity for businesses, too.","I was lucky enough to go see Steve Jobs with Marc Benioff. We were talking about the iPad, and one of the things Jobs said - and it was a little self-serving - was go and build your iPad app, and that is going to change the way you think about your online app, and you will go back, and you will redo your online app. I believe that.","I've used the term 'Facebook for the enterprise,' and everyone goes, 'We don't want Facebook in the enterprise,' because it conjures up that it's not secure, and it's going to be a waste of time. All these things are true, which is why Facebook is not in the enterprise.","What I see now is the consumerisation of IT. I don't want my company to tell me that I have to use a BlackBerry or I have to use a Windows phone. I just want to use the phone I want and have it all work.","After the dotcom boom blew up, it increased the focus on questions like, 'Why should I trust you to help run my business? How do I know you're not going to go away like every other company?' That was hard. We had to keep proving ourselves.","We actually went public partly because we wanted companies to realise we were not going away.","People think floating should be the easiest and happiest time for a company, but it's actually really hard. We were meant to think we'd won - we'd gone public and could go on to new things. But we were only just getting started.","Our output and continued success is all about our culture. Ours has to be highly collaborative, and we have company-wide events and processes to make sure everyone stays aligned.","Phones are a big deal, but tablets are an even bigger deal. So we're doing a lot of design work and experimentation around the tablet experience.","We're paying a lot of attention to the iPad. But we're expanding that to a tablet focus.","We're a very iterative company, so we jump on basically all new technology.","For me, what's crazy is CRM has really evolved, and keeps evolving.","I have employees that are, you know, other types of diversity, coming to me and saying 'Well, why aren't we focused on these other areas as well?' and I said yes, we should focus them, but, you know, the phrase we use internally is, 'If everything is important, then nothing is important.'"],"Parker Palmer":["I think the pursuit of happiness is the pursuit of reality because illusion never leaves us ultimately happy.","America's freedom of religion, and freedom from religion, offers every wisdom tradition an opportunity to address our soul-deep needs: Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, secular humanism, agnosticism and atheism among others.","We are a profoundly interconnected species, as the global economic and ecological crises reveal in vivid and frightening detail. We must embrace the simple fact that we are dependent on and accountable to one another.","What passes for political realism may make for lively academic debates. But it often functions, ironically, as a tool of social control, rendering us passive with an analysis that overwhelms and paralyzes us.","Political civility is not about being polite to each other. It's about reclaiming the power of 'We the People' to come together, debate the common good and call American democracy back to its highest values amid our differences.","Every religious tradition is rooted in mysteries I don't pretend to understand, including claims about what happens after we die. But this I know for sure: as long as we're alive, choosing resurrection is always worth the risk.","When I was depressed, nobody expected anything of me, nor did I expect anything of myself. I was exempt from life's demands and risks. But if I were to find new life, who knows what daunting tasks I might be required to take on?","Movements begin when oppressed people make - and keep remaking - a deeply inward decision to stop consenting to external demands that contradict a critical inner truth, the truth that they are worthy of respect.","Even when life challenges us, it's a gift beyond all measure.","We have been deformed by educational and religious institutions that treat us as members of an audience instead of actors in a drama, so we become adults who treat democracy as a spectator sport.","Whether we're Democrats or Republicans or independents, we have to learn to hang together or we're gonna hang separately.","I think there's a lot of anesthesia being - that's been pumped into American culture, the mass media television, various forms of entertainment, and the illusion of wealth that we now understand to be an illusion as well as the illusion that America is a world power.","There are a million 'oughts' in the world. There's a million ways in which I ought to be serving the world. But the ways I'm gifted to serve and the opportunities that come to me to serve are not a million.","Proposing inner-life solutions to our political and economic catastrophes is something done, say the critics, only by people who've spent more time in la-la land than in the 'real world.'","Fascist movements kill off their critics, literally or metaphorically, while democratic movements value, invite and even welcome criticism.","Whatever America's founders believed about Christianity - and they believed a wide range of things - they clearly rejected the idea of an established church.","As a Christian, I'm passionately opposed to American pretensions that we have special standing with God; to political office-seekers who play on our religious differences; and to the religious arrogance that says, 'Our truth is the only truth.'","Inner-life questions are the kind everyone asks, with or without benefit of God-talk: 'Does my life have meaning and purpose?' 'Do I have gifts that the world wants and needs?' 'Whom and what shall I serve?' 'Whom and what can I trust?' 'How can I rise above my fears?'"],"Parker Posey":["I really liked playing a vampire. Their hunger is insatiable. Even when they eat someone, it's never enough.","It's really weird to be taken seriously for what you're wearing. It makes me want to wear a uniform.","I traveled to Morocco once, and I only saw one television when I was there, but I did go into this dirt cave and I saw this kid chopping tomatoes and pita, and he had a picture on the wall of Jean-Claude Van Damme holding a gun. That connected with him on the other side of the world, so no wonder these big movies are made - they have a mass appeal.","People have more dimensions to them than we give them credit for. The person you meet on the street that you think is someone, and it's someone else. I'm mistaken for someone else all the time.","It's always the girl comedy and the guy comedy. It bums me out. You'd think there'd be a progression, from James L. Brooks and Nora Ephron into more subtle humor and behavior and psychology. All these interesting things people can learn about themselves by watching talented writers comment intelligently on someone else's emotional life.","What's the difference between a personality disorder and a personality? You know? That's what I wanna know!","They're like a weird couple. If you were to personify the artichoke and the oyster, they would have a great date. They would totally get along.","I can do comedy, so people want me to do that, but the other side of comedy is depression. Deep, deep depression is the flip side of comedy. Casting agents don't realize it but in order to be funny you have to have that other side.","I like soap opera acting. If it's done really well, there's nothing better. It's old school. It's like what those melodramas in the '30s and '40s were like.","There are all these scripts where the women, if they're working, are prostitutes and lawyers with an angry streak who'll kill you. It's a reaction to women leaving their men and men being angry about it and saying it on some subconscious level.","But it's fun to be something, have that, and you don't have to be real. It's like, comedians. They go on and they're doing all these jokes. I would be like that if I were more awake.","I wouldn't say I was a queen. Maybe a little elf.","I'm the character actor in Hollywood movies, the girl who has to be annoying so the guy can go to the other girl.","Being an indie queen, people think I have all these choices. Like I've just been sitting around waiting for the best indie film that I deem acceptable.","I'm trying to work in studio movies, but they won't hire me.","My first lead role was probably 'Party Girl' in 1994.","I usually play character parts in Hollywood films.","My dad recently reminded me that my grandfather's cousin was Lefty Frizzell.","I love bayou life.","I don't Twitter, although sometimes I think that I should.","My grandmother is this amazingly theatrical woman. She acted like a movie star, as far as looks and attitude, kind of like Susan Hayward.","There are so few movies that still cast on chemistry. Now it's often, like, this person's movies make this amount of money, and this person's movie makes that amount of money, so let's put them together.","Every time I do something, I worry it's my last job.","Hey, the TV was my friend. As a child, I always said, 'I want to live in there someday.'","I wonder if people who see 'Blade' will have even seen my other movies. But I don't want all my movies to be in a vacuum. I need a balance because one pays, and the other doesn't.","I want to do horror and action, and I'm only being slightly facetious.","There are roles out there and women out there that are fascinating to me, and there are things in our culture that I see that I want to express. It's my passion to express that.","I think to do a proper independent movie, in my experience, it takes 22 or 23 days to shoot. That was 'Party Girl' or 'House of Yes.' But now with the digital camera, the budgets have gotten smaller, and the days have gotten shorter.","Acting is a really strange thing to do; it's very strange.","There are so few stories being produced that are human. I suffer with the loss of that. I feel kind of out of place, even though I've continued to work.","As an artist, you're always going to be yearning and wanting and never satisfied. I never feel like I've really achieved something.","I work with directors who haven't had the experience of being on sets as much as I have. I feel like, in a way, if it's an independent movie, I can teach the crew to kind of relax, or create a vibe. It really is about a vibe.","The five patients in 'Rethinking Cancer' share with us the path of their recovery: the courage to take their own lives in their hands with a natural approach to healing their bodies.","I really like this trend of songwriting that is honest and intelligent and serious and longing.","I like to support local record stores.","I find myself listening to Talk Talk on repeat while I'm doing gardening in upstate New York. Their music is so languid, and I just love his voice.","Imagine if every airport would blast Brian Eno. I bet going through security wouldn't be as difficult. I can't imagine someone being aggressive with me with Brian Eno music pumping through the terminals at LAX.","When my parents were dating, they were very poor, so my dad couldn't take my mom out. They would go to the grocery store and pick out funny looking vegetables. When I grew up, we'd still go and find the ones with personality.","I make a lot of soups, and I love stews. My mother's a big foodie. She went to culinary school in New Orleans and has an oyster-artichoke soup recipe that has no cream in it but it tastes so creamy.","I like trying different foods. I've done vegetarian stuff, and I've gone through meat phases, and then I do no bread, and then I eat bread. I'm really all over the place in the way a lot of actors are.","I got into the whole Ayurvedic thing. It was really cool.","I just want to balance myself holistically and see what different foods do what to me.","I was reading this book called 'Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind.' It's really, really good if you want to believe in that stuff.","I had dreams of conehead aliens when I was little. Before 'Saturday Night Live' did it. And then they came out with them, and I went on to be a glorified extra in the movie. When everyone else was laughing, I was scared.","It sounds so dramatic, but I'll say it: Hollywood just doesn't know what to do with me. And it's not for lack of trying.","It's not really cool to be singled out.","In case you don't know this, we're not in the '90s anymore. Indie cinema does not reign.","People see images now more than they see movies.","You can get money and make a really cheap movie. You can, from independent financers who are just giving you money to support artists. This is what was happening in the '90s, and I was very fortunate to be a part of that.","How can we have our privacy? How can we have our independence now in these times with these cameras? Because I think privacy and our solitude is really important.","There have been periods of my career that I haven't worked for a really long time, like seven or eight months.","The sound of a golf game is very different than the sound of a football game.","I have a twin brother, so I was around guys like a sister. It was comfortable to me.","You have to have a certain amount of limitations, I think, to make art and to make something that can be alive on film. Money can get in the way of that.","I would love to do something like 'Fishing With John.'","I love 'Fishing With John' so much.","I like bears. I like bear people. I like bear-type men.","I've seen deer. I have lots of woodchucks on my property. And bluebirds. Foxes.","I love New York.","You know, it's a really adult thing, for some people, to choose to not be with the one that you love.","Indie movies got co-opted by the studio system. The studios insisted that only stars could make movies successful.","Sometimes I go to movies, and it's just a bombardment, and I'm not entertained by them - I'm assaulted by them! And I know I sound like such a drama queen, but I find that really strange.","I feel like there's such a responsibility, when you make a film, to enlighten people, to make them think, to make them laugh, or even just to be entertaining.","Getting into Sundance is such a big platform for a director.","Everything has its own kind of theatricality and its own drama.","I like 'MacNeil/Lehrer.'","It's really fun to see a movie that you've heard about that's really good.","I'm an actor, so I like costumes.","I learned how to play mandolin for 'A Mighty Wind!'","Mainly I love working on good writing.","I like sitting close to windows.","I like finding things in locations where I've worked and things from down South and things from flea markets or even the sidewalks.","I have a brass bed that's very 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks.' I got it on eBay. It's from the early 1900s.","My aunt in Texas, when she did the hazing things, they had girls swallow oysters. They'd wrap an oyster in dental floss, swallow them, and then pull them back up.","I'm a good girl, you know? But I'm from the South, and there are some powerful women down there, and very theatrical.","It was just such a demeaning thing to do, being in silent movies. They'd call you up and tell you, 'Hey, jump off this building!' and they'd give you a hundred bucks, and you'd do it.","They love putting me in the 'indie queen' box. I had some high standards in my 20s that I don't have anymore.","With 'Dazed and Confused,' I got the high school experience I didn't get to have."],"Parker Stevenson":["You get in before sunrise and you get out after sunset and you go home, eat and collapse. While you're aware of the ratings, you aren't prepared for the response of the fans.","I could be happy doing something like architecture. It would involve another couple of years of graduate school, but that's what I studied in college. That's what I always wanted to do.","Good work is good work wherever it's done, in a play, a motion picture or television, and that includes commercials.","California lacks a lot of the rules and restrictions the East has. Every house is a different style, different material, different color. There's a lot of craziness out there.","During the time I was on The Hardy Boys, I was also watching other people's careers. I thought the next step was to be a movie star. I kept saying no to projects, and offers stopped coming in. I was no longer hot.","I almost rented a house by an architect named Schindler, but I couldn't afford it. It was a jewel.","I did a comparison of a school of architects known as the New York Five. I compared their articulation of wall surfaces, which I enjoyed very much.","I do interviews because it's a chance to be myself. I sometimes wonder what I could have to say that would be of any interest. I don't have any great wisdom.","I like people who are enthused about things they do, like travel, sports, work. I like being with people who have things they're excited about.","I looked along the San Juan Islands and the coast of California, but I couldn't find the palette of green, granite, and dark blue that you can only find in Maine.","I made a classic mistake. I held out for something better.","I remember the day I found out my draft status. I was really floored and kind of staggered around in a daze. It just hadn't occurred to me that I could end up in Vietnam.","I still think of myself really as a New Yorker.","I think the reaction to a World War II situation would be the same today as it was in 1942. Initially, people would question, but once patriotism got stirred up, the whole thing would gather momentum and we'd all pull together.","I used to a lot. I used to go dancing.","I wanted my children to have the same exposure to the water I had. My strongest memories of Northeast Harbor are going in a small Whaler with my dad, looking for osprey.","I was the last one to screen test for The Hardy Boys. I'd like to play that's not as clean-cut as Frank Hardy. I play him as straight as possible.","I'm going to go away on vacation, I'm going to try to get away from the phone, away from scripts. I think it's important to sit back and think about what you want.","I'm more interested in where I'll be in five or 10 years than where I am now.","If I have a Sunday free, I'll go up the coast and spend some time on the beach. I scuba dive and swim and sail. A lot of the things I like are around the water.","If it seems like you're doing work when you're acting, then you're doing something wrong.","In 1942, everyone was ready to go and fight for the good guys. It was so simple.","In this business, you just never know from day to day. It's one reason I held off getting too involved in entertainment. I like being able to plan, I like to know what I'm going to be doing.","Intellectuals would be much more accepted now than in the '40s.","My interest in architecture has always been sculptural. Most of my photography is of architecture.","Suddenly you're surrounded by strangers who want something from you. The thing is, they don't know what they want, and you don't know what they want, unless it's an autograph, and you just sort of stand there grinning at one another.","The first two pictures I did, I played a young student in prep school. When I did Lifeguard, everyone was saying, You're so Southern California. It was a surprise to me.","The Hardy Boys burned me out. I was recharging my batteries. It was time to return to work, but it was tough because my visibility was low.","What I do is not some magical, mystical thing. I simply get up in the morning, get to work on time, say my lines, and do the best I can.","You do show after show after show and get them done and on the air. Television devours material. We work a minimum of 12, 14 hours, and often 15, 18 hours a day.","Young people are forced to mature sooner now than in the '40s. I was doing things at age 14 that guys in the movie were just beginning to do at 16 and 17."],"Parker Young":["Dinner for me is usually some version of chicken or fish - I love salmon - with grilled vegetables and salad.","I love making smoothies post-workout. My favorite - depending on the day - is either a chocolate whey protein shake with banana and peanut butter, or one with vanilla and berries.","I actually was the captain of the football team. I went to Catalina Foothills High School, and I played football all four years. I started on Varsity my sophomore year, and senior year I was captain.","I read somewhere that abs are made in the kitchen, and I'd like to agree. I like to think that I try to eat pretty clean, pretty good food.","I go to this gym in Hollywood: it's a Cross Fit gym. It's basically just a really high intensity, sort of, athletic movements. I'm sure Cross Fit is going to be mad at me for not giving their definition of what Cross Fit is.","I'd love to go back to school for philosophy. I love philosophy, so I'm always reading philosophy books, annoying my girlfriend with that type of stuff.","I've dated girls that aren't, this is gonna sound so horrible, that aren't super smart, but they still are super confident, and that's more what I've been attracted to is the confidence and the sense of humor.","The big challenge is looking ripped and lean without being too big because on camera, it's easy to appear thick.","In theory, I stick to how I could eat if I lived a thousand years ago. I take processed foods off the menu, and stick to things I could hunt or gather, with more fruits, vegetables, and nuts - and less meat."],"Parminder Nagra":["That's what I like about acting. When you're preparing for a role, you do your research, and the bonus is you get to learn these skills. Now, it's on to whatever the next thing is I have to learn.","I got to go to Malaysia, Germany, Switzerland, Madrid, America.","My father in the film - which we probably haven't seen in previous movies, and in British Asian movies you could probably count on one hand - he says exactly why, actually why he's frightened for his daughter. He came to this country, England, and had a bit of a crappy time.","It's been really nice to see different counties that I might never have visited before.","Football is a passion that she holds dear to her heart. She's really going for her dream and there are obstacles in the way, but deep down she knows what she wants, and she pursues that.","Therefore reinforcing a stereotype, therefore thinking that the entire Indian culture is just made of people that are against their children's decisions.","There's apparently soccer leagues that they've set up with young Indian girls.","No, I didn't quite know to what extent the football might be, but it was quite a bonus for me to try to learn new skills and to keep fit at the same time.","In terms of the frustration of my character, I suppose any teenager has probably gone through that, in terms of telling their parents, I want to do one thing, and their parent says no. I think parents sometimes forget that they were children.","In terms of soccer, it wasn't really a thing that girls did. In England it more kind of Net Ball and Hockey and stuff like that in athletics. It's to each their own, really.","In London there was an article about all these girls bending it like Beckham, and in India there's this big wave of girls playing football. Wow! I can't believe a movie's done this!","If I can inspire someone to go in a positive way and pursue a dream, it can only be good.","I'm actually going in to ER as the new British intern.","I'm a British intern going in. I'm hoping that John will just kind of tackle it from who this person is and what she's about rather than trying to go in on her culture. We need to move a step forward than that.","I was worried people would laugh at me when I started to talk the language, but they were just pleasantly surprised that I could. The sense of humour here is great - once I could have a giggle, I settled down.","I really identified with Jess, because my own dream was acting, which isn't the most conventional profession.","But we had a fantastic coach, Simon Clifford, who runs a British football youth game which teaches Brazilian techniques - which is what we wanted to incorporate into the film. And some of those things we eventually got in.","But it's a very universal story and the thing is I was reluctant to answer that question because I don't want people latching on to a particular stereotype.","But I think it's also hard to get into soccer here. I think purely on a time level on television as well because of the ad breaks. It's something to do with that as well. You can't show a complete soccer match here. Which I kind of find a bit of an odd thing.","Before I started doing the film and when I found out I was going to be doing it, I just decided to pump up on the whole cardio stuff. Just in terms of stamina.","At times those skills were really hard to do because not only was I having to contend with the camera, but I was having to learn these new skills and the ball was always kind of doing what you didn't want it to do. So it got a little bit frustrating at times but we got there.","And of course in America you've got American football and baseball and all those other ball games, soccer has become a little niche that the women have kind of filled."],"Parris Glendening":["Not since the Depression has the state been this dry, have our rivers been this low, our water table this low, and our reservoirs this low.","The bottom line is that there is a lot more that could and should be done to help people with nutrition and exercise."],"Parvesh Cheena":["Parvesh Cheena is a real treat for the ladies.","You have to tease your family. You tease the ones that you're closest to.","In the states we all have this idea, everyone who wants to be the next best singer, next best dancer. Those same wants and desires are in India, too.","If 'Married With Children' hadn't come out when it did, would we really be looking at 'Roseanne,' 'The Middle,' and 'Raising Hope' and being, like, 'Look at how stereotypical they are to lower-income white people!'","When you have the first show set in India on American television, there's gonna be a Nervous Nellie kind of vibe.","When my family did shy away from Indian food, we'd eat a lot of Chinese. We'd use the wok a lot. I never had a problem with Brussels sprouts or broccoli growing up. I always grew up with the mentality of finishing your plate.","My big downfall is deep-dish pizza from Chicago. That is why I can't go vegan - I can't give up cheese. I can't give up dairy.","I was afraid of Korean food when I moved to L.A., let alone sushi. I remember thinking either sink or swim. Living here in Studio City, Ventura Blvd. is the Mecca of sushi restaurants. What you thought was so exotic is just run of the mill.","I'm kind of fascinated by Paula Deen. I've been to her restaurant, The Lady and Sons, in Savannah. My friend was studying in the area, and we ate at her restaurant, and it was right at the cusp where Paula Deen became Paula Deen."],"Pasquier Quesnel":["Zeal is very blind, or badly regulated, when it encroaches upon the rights of others.","The truth only irritates those it enlightens, but does not convert."],"Pastor Maldonado":["You can always improve your fitness if you keep training.","In my city of Maracay, there is a go kart circuit about five minutes from my home. When I was about three or four years old, I said I wanted to race, but I was too young; then, when I reached the age of seven, my father gave me a kart and we started from there.","Williams is one of the big names in F1 with a really strong pedigree, so it is an honour to be driving for them.","Williams really does feel like a family, and I have built up very good relationships with people here; in fact, some of my best friends work for Williams. A friendly atmosphere can really help on the track as well because I feel like I can communicate freely with the team.","As a driver, you always dream of winning a F1 race, and to win so early on in my career was very special.","Having competed themselves, my father and my uncle are very passionate about motorsport, so I inherited it from them.","After karting in Venezuela, I came to Europe in 1998 to compete in international kart races, which was great for me to get experience racing outside my country. After consistently being at the top, I decided to move to Italian Formula Renault.","I just want to do my best, to be as close to the top as I can, and to get the maximum out of the car.","I did some mistakes; I accept that - I always accept my mistakes. For sure, we are looking forward to improve, to deliver my best as always.","I'm used to having a lot of criticism. It's normal. It's normal when you come from South America, when you have a country pushing very hard in your back.","We live in a free world, so everyone can say whatever."],"Pat Barker":["Culturally, the First World War is the war that stands in for other wars.","What I hate in fiction is when the author knows better than the characters what they should do.","I wasn't thinking of a sequel when I finished 'Life Class.' What changed my mind was the perception that the characters had a lot of life left in them, a lot of unresolved conflicts, and also I became interested in the Tonks pastel portraits of facially disfigured soldiers and in the whole area of facial reconstruction.","That balance between involvement and detachment is what novelists do. It's the ideal relationship between a novelist and a character, I think, total involvement and identity and empathy, stopping short of being autobiographical - in my case, anyway - but also quite detached.","When writing about historical characters I try to be as accurate as possible, and in particular not to misrepresent the view they held. With a real historical figure you have to be fair, and this is not an obligation you have in dealing with your own creations, so it is quite different.","I wanted to be a novelist from a very early age - 11 or 12 - but I don't think I ever thought I would write historical fiction. I never thought I might write academic history because I simply wasn't good enough!","'Undertones of War' by Edmund Blunden seems to get less attention than the memoirs of Siegfried Sassoon and Robert Graves, but it is a great book.","Being a writer is a poverty trap. I mean, it's a terrible profession.","Fiction should be about moral dilemmas that are so bloody difficult that the author doesn't know the answer.","My grandmother's first husband was a spiritualist medium. What fascinates me about that is the balance between conviction and sincerity and trickery, which is also something that novelists are very familiar with.","I didn't belong to the sort of family where the children's classics were laid on. I went to the public library and read everything I could get my hands on.","When I'm writing the first draft, I'm writing in a very slovenly way: anything to get the outline of the story on paper."],"Pat Benatar":["You don't want to trash what you've done; that's your history.","Everything must change, everything must move forward.","If at any moment of the day I ever think I'm remotely cool at all, which is hardly ever, I have two daughters who make sure that never happens.","Most chick singers say 'if you hurt me, I'll die'... I say, 'if you hurt me, I'll kick your ass.'","Love and pain become one in the same in the eyes of a wounded child.","There are so many young women coming up through the ranks. Adele is an amazing singer. Beyonce has great stage presence. She's just a beautiful woman. I love how everyone has just taken charge of their lives and careers.","You shouldn't have to pay for your love with your bones and your flesh.","Before I put another notch in my lipstick case, you better make sure you put me in my place.","With the power of conviction, there is no sacrifice.","People's lives change dramatically over such a long time period, and I think that if you're still vital, and you're still interested in writing and things like that, of course your music evolves and reflects where you are in your life.","I don't care who's on the label, because I have a job to do.","I wasn't a visionary but I literally had my finger on the pulse of the women of America.","I never looked at people or singing as commodities.","I like Lady Gaga because I like that she pushes the envelope.","I love Katy Perry, she is a wonderful pop singer.","First of all, I'm pretty private about my personal life.","When you have girl children they torture you!","When the first record came out, I'd go down to radio stations pretty much every day to get the record played, and I would walk in and they'd tell us how much they loved the record, but they weren't sure how much they could play it because they were already playing a girl.","But the soul of touring and the heart of it is basically every day is like putting up a circus tent.","If you're retired, it's a blessing. You know, if you want to keep working and doing what you want to do, it's not a blessing as all - it's a curse.","Everything changes all the time, and unfortunately, everyone who knows what you do by buying records only hears a small amount of what's going on in your life.","'Hell is for Children' is amazing to do every night and 'Promises in the Dark' and 'Love Is a Battlefied,' of course, but my absolute favorite would be 'Heartbreaker.' It's the one that started everything, so it has a very special place in my heart. And it still rocks every night! It's so fun to do.","It was very difficult when I was trying to figure out how to have a marriage and babies and do this at the same time. There was no handbook. You were making it up as you went along.","When you have girl children, they torture you! If at any moment of the day I ever think I'm remotely cool at all, which is hardly ever, I have two daughters who make sure that never happens. They say, 'Mom, you didn't really wear that?' And I say, 'Yes, and pretty much everyone saw it.'","I love Katy Perry and Lady GaGa. I think GaGa's pushing the envelope every day and I really like that."],"Pat Boone":["I think the best president - because he changed the whole mood of the country, the whole economy of the country, and stood up to Communism... that was continuing its causes around the world, and backed them off and caused them to collapse - and that was Ronald Reagan.","Don't trust anyone over 30.","I've always wanted to stay involved with young people. I never bought into the idea that entertainers owe nothing to their audience except a good performance.","It is quite true - in fact, obvious on the surface - that the vast majority of dramatic shows and comedies, as well, advocate a liberal and humanistic and relativistic lifestyle and concept.","We've been in the same house since 1960, so we've been here for 45 years now.","I've had death threats, if you can imagine.","In this culture, where entertainers and athletes wield such power, it seems only right to me that they try to make their influence a good one.","When you get married you forget about kissing other women.","I'm associated with gospel music in the minds of millions of people.","In fact - statistically, as you know - people have done polls, research, and at least 80 percent or more or working media are liberal Democrats if they are involved with any party and certainly liberal in their philosophy.","Ironically, for a few million people in the Far East, I did become an English teacher through my music.","So although women can do anything that men can't do, they can also do something that men can't do, and that is mother their children.","So I have four daughters, about ten granddaughters, and five grandsons.","So I would say Reagan was the best, and certainly Clinton the worst.","So obviously, any religion embodies some form of rules and expectations for behavior, and even sometimes consequences, and they don't want to hear any of that.","Then the album created a tremendous furor and got me kicked off Christian television for two months, and then restored after they settled down and listened to the music and realized there was nothing wrong with it.","This may surprise you, but I was arrested in high school.","When political figures are shown on television or in movies, it's always the liberal Democrats that are shown to be humane, caring people.","If there's anyone in my lifetime who deserves honor it is Billy Graham. I think he is the most significant figure since the apostles."],"Pat Bowlen":["I said publicly last year that I wanted 2012 to be a great season, not just a good season. We certainly had a very good season and perhaps exceeded a few expectations. But Broncos fans, you and I know what a great season looks like.","I don't do e-mails.","I have short-term memory loss. I know that some of the memories of the Super Bowl championships are fading.","I don't run the triathlons anymore like I used to. I do leg work on the machines and do the bike. I'm not as strong as I used to be, but I'm still good.","We haven't had the success we had hoped to achieve. Josh McDaniels is the head coach of the Broncos and you always strive for stability at that position. However, with five games left in the 2010 season, we will continue to monitor the progress of the team and evaluate what's in the best interest of this franchise."],"Pat Brown":["In reality, those rare few cases with good forensic evidence are the ones that make it to court.","Police are reluctant to label a murder as a possible serial homicide.","We assume people we know can't be serial killers.","Often I am asked if there is any such thing as a female serial killer.","Serial killing is not about sex at all, but about power and control and revenge on society.","There are many more serial killers living outside the prison walls than inside.","There are two kinds of serial killers as far as the victim is concerned: the kind that you don't see before they pounce on you and the kind you see and don't expect to pounce on you.","What does signature mean? Supposedly these are the added touches that make the crime personal to the killer.","All serial killers want to win. They choose victims they can kill successfully.","Evidence can vary depending on the circumstances, the weather, and how long it has been hanging around.","In reality, serial killers are of average intelligence.","Killers can seem smart when you can't figure out who they are.","Last but not least among serial killer methodologies, we have women who kill their own children.","Many of the less prolific killers' stories go unheard because they simply don't make good books.","Most well-known serial killers have victims numbering in the dozens, have sent taunting letters to the police or have done bizarre things to the bodies.","Nowadays, with much more racial and ethnic mixing, we are seeing serial killers murdering a variety of victims; whoever comes along will most likely do.","Often, a serial killer has no felony record.","Outside of dumb luck, the number one way serial killers are caught is through the help of the public.","Serial killers are everywhere! Well, perhaps not in our neighborhood, but on our television screens, at the movie theatres, and in rows and rows of books at our local Borders or Barnes and Noble Booksellers.","Serial killers kill for the power and control they experience during the murders and for the added ego boost they get in the aftermath from community fears, media coverage, and the police investigations.","Since there are only so many ways to kill a person, a good portion of homicides look pretty much alike.","Telling the community a serial killer is out there stirs up a lot of unpleasant attention.","The accepted definition of a serial killer is a person who kills at least three times with a cooling off period in between his murders.","The most important issue for the killer is the ability to get a victim easily and successfully.","The one noticeable similarity with almost all serial killer victims is their short height and low weight.","Using MO to link crimes can be problematic.","We struggle to understand how any mother could kill her own children.","While there are many wonderful police investigators out there doing some very fine work, the majority of the time it is not brains that catches serial killers.","While we are being fascinated by the tales of famous serial killers and how they were brought to justice, the real serial killer goes about his business with hardly a thought to being caught.","Without solid connections between homicides, we may have the reverse problem of believing three local murders are the work of one serial killer when they may actually be the work of three!"],"Pat Buchanan":["If the Islamic world is so suffused with rage and hatred of us - for our wars, occupations, drone attacks, support of Israel, decadent culture, and tolerance of insults to Islam and the Prophet - why should we call for free elections, when the people will use those elections to vote into power rulers hostile to the United States?","All you have to do is come to Ohio and say, 'I think NAFTA is a lousy deal,' and everybody cheers.","Many Muslims put their Islamic faith ahead of their national identity and forbid preachers from other religions from coming into their countries to convert their young. Apostasy is treason to Allah. Heresy has no rights.","Why, a quarter of a century after the Cold War, do we still have 28,000 troops in Korea?","We have no vital national interest in Syria's civil war.","While immensely beneficial to Seoul, is this U.S. guarantee to fight Korean War II, 64 years after the first, wise? Russia, China and Japan retain the freedom to decide whether and how to react, should war break out. Why do we not?","I opposed the World Trade Organization.","Bullying is something every kid in public, parochial, or private school has witnessed by graduation. While unfortunate, it is part of growing up.","A U.S. war with Iran could end with a Kurdish enclave in Iran's northwest tied to Iraqi Kurdistan, Iran's Azeri north drifting toward Azerbaijan, and a Balochi enclave in the south linked to Pakistan's largest province, Balochistan, leaving Iran only Persia.","While our corporatists burn incense at the shrine of the global economy, Trump went to visit the working-class casualties. And those forgotten Americans in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin responded.","Why should Americans on the DMZ be among the first to die in a second Korean War? Should the North attack the South, could we not honor our treaty obligations with air and naval power offshore?","Herbert Hoover failed through no fault of his own. The Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression were beyond his control, and every remedy he tried failed adequately to work.","If there is a horrific attack on this country like 9/11, the American people will demand we go to war and settle accounts with those who did it. But America's appetite for intervention, for nation building, for democracy crusades, is fully sated.","Whatever they did for democracy, the U.S. interventions in the Middle East and the vaunted Arab Spring have proved to be pure hell for Arab Christians.","Historically, the Balkans have been an incubator of war.","A Syrian war would consume Trump's presidency.","Preach or proselytize for Christianity in much of the Islamic world, and you are a candidate for martyrdom. Practice freedom of speech in Xi Jinping's China, and you can wind up in a cell.","As polarized as we have been, we Americans are locked in a cultural war for the soul of our country.","Just as there's garbage that pollutes the Potomac river, there is garbage polluting our culture. We need an Environmental Protection Agency to clean it up.","The problem with some of our noisier exponents of 'American exceptionalism' is that they lack Reagan's moral maturity.","Stop exporting American jobs. Stop exporting American factories, and stop exporting American sovereignty and independence to global institutions like the World Trade Organization.","Beijing cannot sit by and let her North Korean ally be bombed, nor can it allow U.S. and South Korean forces to defeat the North, bring down the regime, and unite the peninsula, with U.S. and South Korean soldiers sitting on the Yalu, as they did in 1950 before Mao ordered his Chinese army into Korea.","When politicians don black robes and seize powers they do not have, they should be called out for what they are - usurpers and petty tyrants.","Saying the Washington Post is just a newspaper is like saying Rasputin was just a country priest.","The food that enters the mind must be watched as closely as the food that enters the body.","Once an entitlement program has been created with millions of beneficiaries, it becomes almost impossible to repeal.","How does one leave Social Security and Medicare untouched, grow defense by more than $50 billion, slash taxes, launch a $1 trillion infrastructure program - and not explode the deficit and national debt?","The bipolar world of the Cold War is history. The new world order, however, is not the One World dreamed of by Wilsonian idealists. It is a Balkanizing world where race, tribe, culture and creed matter most, and democracy is seen not as an end in itself but as a means to an end - the accretion of power by one's own kind to achieve one's own dreams.","Bush II's democracy crusade and Obama's embrace of the Arab Spring have unleashed and empowered forces less receptive to America's wishes and will than the despots and dictators deposed with our approval.","I think the Catholic faith is consistent with the kind of conservatism I believe in.","What would be the political benefits to Obama of an amnesty? It could weld Hispanics to the Democratic Party, would be wildly popular with the ideological and Christian Left, and quietly welcomed by those Chamber-of-Commerce Republicans who have silently supported amnesty and secretly want immigration off the table in 2016.","Lyndon Johnson, his 44-state landslide in 1964 and Great Society notwithstanding, was by 1968 a failed president being repudiated in the primaries of his own party.","Defeat has its lessons as well as victory.","No one has deputized America to play Wyatt Earp to the world.","Bill Clinton's foreign policy experience stems mainly from having breakfast at the International House of Pancakes.","Anti-Catholicism is the anti-Semitism of the intellectual.","I've just come back from Mississippi and over there when you talk about the West Bank they think you mean Arkansas.","I don't doubt a number of those ballots, of those votes that were cast for me, probably were intended for Vice President Gore.","If the Europeans want to intervene, that's their business. But if I were president, I would remove every United States soldier from the Balkan peninsula.","McCarthy emerged in the person of Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin.","If a country forgets where it came from, how will its people know who they are?","Parents have a right to insist that godless evolution not be taught to their children.","Candidate Trump held out his hand to Vladimir Putin. He rejected further U.S. intervention in Syria other than to smash ISIS.","President Trump's seeming renunciation of an anti-interventionist foreign policy is the great surprise of the first 100 days, and the most ominous. For any new war could vitiate the Trump mandate and consume his presidency.","To get Xi Jinping to help with our Pyongyang problem, Trump has dropped all talk of befriending Taiwan, backed off Tillerson's warning to Beijing to vacate its fortified reefs in the South China Sea, and held out promises of major concessions to Beijing in future trade deals.","Among the achievements celebrated in Trump's first 100 days are the 59 cruise missiles launched at the Syrian airfield from which the gas attack on civilians allegedly came, and the dropping of the 22,000-pound MOAB bomb in Afghanistan. But what did these bombings accomplish?","Second-generation Muslims who have lived all their lives in Europe are turning up among the suicide bombers and terrorists.","As the numbers of native-born Europeans begin to fall, with their anemic fertility rates, will the aging Europeans become more magnanimous toward destitute newcomers who do not speak the national language or assimilate into the national culture but consume its benefits?","Russia and China, which have embraced autocratic capitalism, have attracted admirers and emulators by the seeming success of their strongman rule.","Democracy requires common ground on which all can stand, but that ground is sinking beneath our feet, and democracy may be going down the sinkhole with it.","Where liberals see as an ever-more-splendid diversity of colors, creeds, ethnicities, ideologies, beliefs and lifestyles, the Right sees the disintegration of a country, a nation, a people, and its replacement with a Tower of Babel. Visions in conflict that democracy cannot reconcile.","Where are the gains for religious freedom and human rights to justify all the bombings, invasions and wars we have conducted in the lands from Libya to Pakistan - to justify the losses we have endured and the death and suffering we have inflicted?","Why is Assad more responsible for all the deaths in Syria than those fighting to overthrow and kill him?","In 2013, a great national coalition came together to compel Congress to deny Barack Obama authority to take us to war in Syria.","The Democrats' drive to defeat Neil Gorsuch is the latest battle in a 50-year war for control of the Supreme Court - a war that began with a conspiracy against Richard Nixon by Chief Justice Earl Warren, Justice Abe Fortas and Lyndon Johnson.","If U.S. air, naval, missile, and ground forces were not in and around Korea, and if we were not treaty-bound to fight alongside South Korea, there would be no reason for Kim to build rockets to threaten a distant superpower that could reduce his hermit kingdom to ashes.","Angela Merkel puts Germany first.","He rejects the New World Order established at the Cold War's end by the United States. Putin puts Russia first.","Much of the hostility toward Putin stems from the fact that he not only defies the West when standing up for Russia's interests, he often succeeds in his defiance and goes unpunished and unrepentant.","While the 20th century saw the world divided between a Communist East and a free and democratic West, new and different struggles define the 21st.","What strategic benefit would accrue from having Montenegro as an ally that would justify the risk of our having to go to war should some neighbor breach Montenegro's borders?","What vital U.S. interest is imperiled in who comes to power in Podgorica, Montenegro? Why cannot Europe handle this problem in its own back yard?","President Trump should tell the Senate, 'No more admissions to NATO, no more U.S. war guarantees, unless I have recommended or approved them.' Foreign policy is made in the White House, not on the Senate floor.","Turkey, a powerful and reliable ally of the U.S. through the Cold War, appears to be coming unmoored from Europe and the West and is becoming increasingly sectarian, autocratic, and nationalistic.","While anti-immigrant and anti-E.U. parties across Europe may not take power anywhere in 2017, theirs is now a permanent and growing presence, leeching away support from centrist parties left and right.","While President Obama may not have ordered any surveillance of Trump or his advisors, the real question is whether he or Attorney General Loretta Lynch were aware of or approved of any surveillance of Trump and his staff during the campaign.","Russian hacking of the DNC is a problem, not a scandal.","How does the GOP repeal and replace Obamacare without cutting the benefits upon which millions of Americans have come to rely?","As the culture war is about irreconcilable beliefs about God and man, right and wrong, good and evil, and is at root a religious war, it will be with us so long as men are free to act on their beliefs.","One can only imagine how Iranians or Afghans would deal with unelected judges moving to de-Islamicize their nations.","Can anyone seriously contend that whether a 14-year-old boy, who thinks he is a girl, gets to use the girls' bathroom is a civil rights issue comparable to whether African-Americans get the right to vote?","Among the reasons Donald Trump is president is that he read the nation and the world better than his rivals.","While our bipartisan establishment worships diversity, Trump saw Middle America recoiling from the demographic change brought about by Third World invasions. And he promised to curb them.","Putin could no more survive returning Crimea to Ukraine than Bibi Netanyahu could survive giving East Jerusalem back to Jordan.","Our own CIA has a storied history of interfering in elections. In the late '40s, we shoveled cash into France and Italy after World War II to defeat the Communists who had been part of the wartime resistance to the Nazis and Fascists.","That a district judge would overrule the president of the United States on a matter of border security in wartime is absurd.","Secularist justices de-Christianized our country. They invented new rights for vicious criminals as though criminal justice were a game. They tore our country apart with idiotic busing orders to achieve racial balance in public schools.","Undeniably, we were on God's side in World War II and the Cold War. But were we ourselves without sin in those just struggles?","If Trump's talking to Putin can help end the bloodshed in Ukraine or Syria, it would appear to be at least as ethical an act as pulpiteering about our moral superiority on the Sunday talk shows.","The Bay of Pigs became a metaphor for feckless folly and failure.","What happened to the America we grew up in, the America of Truman, Ike, JFK and Reagan?","With homosexual marriage gaining converts among the young, the party of the Moral Majority declines to stand with Chick-fil-A.","On right-to-life, see the Republicans flee from Todd Akin, who committed a gaffe while restating his support for what has been a plank of the Republican platform since 1980.","The GOP's insoluble problem is that the multicultural, multiethnic, and multilingual country they created with their open borders appears not to like the brand of dog food the party sells.","The GOP used to be united on a traditionalist view of social and moral issues.","The Republican Party of Richard Nixon was called to power in 1968 to bring an honorable end to the war in Vietnam and restore law and order to campuses and cities convulsed by crime, riots and racial violence. Nixon appeared to have succeeded and was rewarded with a 49-state landslide.","From America's schools, religion has been relentlessly purged. No prayers, no Bibles, no Christian symbols, no Ten Commandments.","Our elite believe in a new trinity of equality, democracy and diversity. Indeed, after the Cold War, we declared the spread of democracy worldwide to be our historic mission and national goal.","Our Founding Fathers who created this republic did not believe in democracy. When did we come to worship this idol?","Can America continue down the path President Obama is taking us on, to a time soon and certain when a majority of wage-earners pay no income taxes but a majority of citizens receive federal benefits?","Retired Americans living on Social Security, exempt from taxes because their income is modest, are not the problem.","What kind of society have we become when children in a great city cannot rely on mothers or fathers for a bowl of cereal in the morning and a brown bag with a sandwich and apple in it for lunch?","For Americans of the Greatest Generation that fought World War II and of the Silent Generation that came of age in the 1950s, the great moral and ideological cause was the Cold War. It gave purpose and clarity to our politics and foreign policy, and our lives.","During the Cold War, the United States took its friends where it found them. If they were willing to cast their lot with us, from the Shah to Gen. Pinochet, we welcomed them. Democratic dissidents like Jawaharlal Nehru in India and Olof Palme in Sweden got the back of our hand.","While the Assads are despotic, George H.W. Bush made the father an ally in Desert Storm, and Ehud Barak offered to return to Hafez Assad the Golan Heights in exchange for a peace deal.","When the faith dies, the culture it produced begins to die, then the civilization goes, and, then, the population.","Anybody that believes that a country can be maintained that has no ethnic core to it or no linguistic core to it, I believe, is naive in the extreme.","My job is not to make people happy; it's to tell the truth as I see it.","I opposed NAFTA in 1993 and '94.","If the GOP wants to know why it lost the Reagan Democrats, it is because the GOP exported their jobs to Mexico and China.","What is good for General Motors is not good for America if General Motors is moving production out of the United States.","The hour of the liberal interventionists like Hillary Clinton in Libya, like the neocons' hour of power in the GOP, is over.","I said these trade deals are going to be terrible: we're going to lose manufacturing jobs, factories abroad; the real wages of Americans are not going to rise. People are coming across the border; it has got to be stopped.","Trump has raised the very issues I raised in the early '90s."],"Pat Buckley":["I can find God in nature, in animals, in birds and the environment.","I believe that life is a journey towards God, and that no one has the right to insist that you go a certain road.","All churches and all religions contain aspects of the truth, but only God is truth.","I believe that there may be intelligent life on other planets.","I believe that God made this wonderful universe and all that exists.","I believe that the whole human race is the family of God.","There is no one true church.","The only sexual act that is sinful is the one that uses or abuses.","Religion can be both good and bad - it is spirituality that counts.","No man is infallible.","I hold that religion and faith are two different things.","I believe that sex is good and so is the body.","I believe that in this world it is impossible to understand God.","I believe that I am only at a beginning, only knocking at a door, and I believe that the best is yet to come.","I believe that God and reality are too big for my poor words.","I believe that dogma is often evil.","I believe that all men and women will be saved.","I believe in the power of weakness.","I believe in the freedom of God's sons and daughters.","I believe in people, especially suffering people.","I believe in a packed Heaven and an empty Hell.","A Buddhist or a good atheist is as acceptable to God as a good Catholic."],"Pat Burns":["I'm not an overly happy person. There are times when I'm happy, and that's usually in my private life.","They're trying to kill me before I'm dead. I come to Quebec to spend some time with my family and they say I'm dead.","I know my life is nearing its end and I accept that.","As for my career, I always said to my kids, 'you don't cry because it's over, you're happy because it happened.'","Coming to another hockey Mecca like Toronto makes you a better coach. I want to have fun again. I want to make it fun for everybody, and it's fun when you win.","I believe in Wendel Clark. We want Wendel to be a prime-time player.","Excuse my voice - I don't have the thundering voice I used to have to get players going on the ice anymore.","Toronto was a great place to work, a fun place to work. People were so hockey-oriented, hockey-minded, without being too critical. In Montreal, they got downright nasty sometimes.","The kids get cheated out of a lot of times with their dad. They were good about it.","I got hit with an octopus in Detroit one time. It was the most gross thing I've ever had happen. I got it right in the back of the neck; all the juice was coming down. It was awful.","Coaching the Bruins is like going bear hunting with a butter knife.","If one of my players ever wants to hit me, he better do it really hard because otherwise, I'll find a rock, a stick, or a piece of wood - and believe me, it's gonna be a brawl."],"Pat Cadigan":["My best friend Rosemarie and I had a very involved secret life when we were in elementary school. After we saw 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' on TV, we invented a whole secret life in which we were twins from the planet Venus, and we were in charge of the entire solar system as well as Earth.","I'm old enough to remember when the polio vaccine was still new. Also, it hadn't been that long since most people who caught pneumonia died from it. These medical breakthroughs were practically miracles.","What I have found most surprising is the amount of damage we have done to environment in the course of my lifetime - not even five and a half decades.","Perhaps this is because I'm from the generation that grew up watching 'The Jetsons' on TV, but I really thought we would be much more advanced in the areas of transportation and medicine.","Most people who are on the inside of a technology have no idea what it's like to look at from an end user's point of view. This is why they have focus groups. I'm really familiar with this because I worked 10 years for Hallmark Cards in the U.S.","I took this 'how to build computers' course basically because I'm sick and tired of getting ripped off by cheesy computer companies. Software baffles me. I like hardware. I used to change my own oil, and now I want to build my own computer so I can have what I want.","Cyberpunk was really a reaction against old boy sci-fi which was about white guys in space who would come up with some kind of technological thing.","In my last year at Hallmark, we finally began putting verses on computer. It had been all in filing cabinets on index cards. They had to assign a 4 digit serial number to each sentiment, for each area of feeling.","I used to think that, by the 21st century, cars would run on electricity rather than gasoline and would have guidance systems so that they actually drove themselves. Specially equipped roadways would transmit instructions to the cars, telling them where to go and how fast. I figured this would be in the lines painted on the roads."],"Pat Cash":["It'll certainly give the pigeons something to do.","Women's tennis is two sets of rubbish that lasts only half an hour.","I call tennis the McDonald's of sport - you go in, they make a quick buck out of you, and you're out.","There's a lot of heartache because you don't always win. You need loads of determination.","I had always dreamed of winning Wimbledon and when it happened it was very stressful. It was more of a relief!","He is very upbeat but we hear that all the time from just about any athlete."],"Pat Conroy":["Without music, life is a journey through a desert.","A recipe is a story that ends with a good meal.","Though Nathalie Dupree did not remember much about my presence in her class, it marked me forever. I remain her enthusiast, her evangelist, her acolyte, and her grateful student. She taught me that cooking and storytelling make the most delightful coconspirators.","The great thing about all my siblings is we all agree we had a horrendous childhood. It's not like it doesn't affect us now; it affects us every day, in everything we do.","When I bought a collection of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky, I returned home with a bright enthusiasm to begin the long march into the Russian soul. Though I've failed to read either man to completion, they both helped me to imagine that my fictional South Carolina was as vast a literary acreage as their Russia.","Writing is more about imagination than anything else. I fell in love with words. I fell in love with storytelling.","The University of South Carolina has always played a role in my life and the intellectual life of South Carolina.","There's always a version of me who is the narrator. And I make myself look better than other people.","To Southerners like my mother, 'Gone With the Wind' was not just a book; it was an answer, a clenched fist raised to the North, an anthem of defiance.","Let me now praise the American writer James Dickey. In 1970, his novel 'Deliverance' was published. I found it to be 278 pages that approached perfection. Its tightness of construction and assuredness of style reminded me of 'The Great Gatsby.'","I became a novelist because of 'Gone With the Wind,' or more precisely, my mother raised me up to be a 'Southern' novelist, with a strong emphasis on the word 'Southern' because 'Gone With the Wind' set my mother's imagination ablaze when she was a young girl growing up in Atlanta.","The most powerful words in English are 'Tell me a story,' words that are intimately related to the complexity of history, the origins of language, the continuity of the species, the taproot of our humanity, our singularity, and art itself.","Every industry is going to be affected (by the aging population). This creates tremendous opportunities and tremendous challenges.","I've never cackled with laughter at a single line I've ever written. None of it has given me pleasure.","When I was 5 years old, my mother read me 'Gone With The Wind' at night, before I went to bed. I remember her reading almost all year.","I meet kids now who become novelists, poets, write for the theater and movies, who were simply inspired by what they saw during the Spoleto Festival.","I only hope to do well enough before I die to have a house as big as my rich Uncle Ed and Aunt Carole.","My father wouldn't let me take typing in childhood.","I still write in long hand. I type like a chimpanzee.","I think I learned about the relationship between books and life from Margaret Mitchell.","I never read my reviews... not even the good ones. Barbra Streisand once told me, if just one person in the audience doesn't applaud, it bothers her. I'm the same way. I'd be devastated to read that someone didn't like my work.","Writing has never been that simple for me.","I loved my parents... but that can never change the fact that my father's violence ruined my childhood.","I hated my father long before I knew there was a word for hate.","I don't believe in happy families.","There are other writers who try for subtle and minimalists effects, but I don't travel in that tribe.","I love books about treks and journeys into the unknown.","I wrote a piece for the school literary magazine that now makes me think: 'My God in Heaven, this is just the worst drivel.'","It's an article of faith that the novels I've loved will live inside me forever.","I think that my mother, Frances Dorothy Peck, modeled her whole life on that of Scarlett O'Hara.","I would love to see young writers come out of college and know there is a possibility to be a novelist.","I've met many, many writers who say they would never write about their family, never write about people they did not totally make up. But that is not the composition of my character.","I'm fascinated by the people I grew up with and the mistakes I made - and God, I have screwed up. I like writing about where it all went off course.","I have found human nature a bit contradictory in my living of it. Human life is incredibly strange.","My father's violence is the central fact of my art and my life.","When my novel 'Beach Music' came out in 1995, I had included a couple of recipes in the book and had tried to impart some of my love of Roman cuisine and the restaurants of Rome.","A family is too frail a vessel to contain the risks of all the warring impulses expressed when such a group meets on common ground.","I mark the reading of 'Look Homeward, Angel' as one of the pivotal events of my life. It starts off with the single greatest, knock-your-socks-off first page I have ever come across in my careful reading of world literature.","A novel is a great act of passion and intellect, carpentry and largess. From the very beginning, I wrote to explain my own life to myself, and I invited readers who chose to make the journey with me to join me on the high wire.","Fear is the major cargo that American writers must stow away when the writing life calls them into carefully chosen ranks.","My great fear of being attacked or trivialized by my contemporaries made me concentrate on what I was trying to do as a writer. It forced me to draw some conclusions that were my own.","I could not bear to think that I wrote a five-hundred page novel just because I needed to love my father.","Love came in wounded and frantic ways to my dismaying family.","I still get weepy when I see a father being nice to his child. It so affects me.","I told my kids when they were little, 'Look, kids, your mother and I are screwing you up somehow. We don't understand how, or we wouldn't do it. But we're parents. So somehow we're damaging you, and I want you to know that early. So just ignore me when I go to that part of my parenting.'","I'm not the lovable, wonderful, tenderhearted grandfather that you read about in books. I'm grouchy and curmudgeonly, and I have a lot of rules."],"Pat Garrett":["If we get a few solid festival shows then I will have no problem booking the lads for as many quality club shows around them to make a nice tour come together.","However, the radio and national media depend much more on the hype from a good record label, and from a ' buzz ' about a band, then from just one or two good shows. There are a lot of artists that have a ton of good press going for them, and still do not make it big in the US.","I have been firming up and making changes in my roster for 2001. This needs to be done from now and then, to make sure what you are booking is working, and to keep a balance in your roster that works."],"Pat Gillick":["There's always, I guess, a philosophy that if you come in, you want to change all the parts, you want to change everything over. I've always tried to preach that consistency and continuity are very, very important. So if I know the baseball people, and I know they're competent and could do the job, I don't see any reason to replace them.","I was trying to land an 18-year-old strapping first baseman from Blanco, Texas, population 200. His name was Willie Upshaw. It turned out there were only three scouts who knew about Willie - Dave Yocum and I working for the Yankees, and Al LaMacchia from the Atlanta Braves.","Building a baseball team is like building a house. You look for the best architects, the best builders - and then you let them do their jobs.","No matter how much technology changes scouting, no matter how much free agency and big TV contracts change the business of baseball, I hope and pray that the heart of the game will never change.","When you talk about the American League, you think of Fenway. When you talk about the National League, you think of Wrigley and the fan base that they have in Chicago.","We fought like heck for every player and every advantage, but we knew we were part of something bigger than ourselves. To me, that is what baseball is all about. I hope it is always what baseball is all about.","Philadelphia loves its team, and being able to win a World Series for the city, fans, players and our Phillies organization meant so much to me.","You need to have camaraderie in the clubhouse. Wherever you're working, be it a baseball team or at a business, you want to walk in there and say, 'Geez, it's great to be at work. Let's go get 'em,' as opposed to walking in there knowing there's going to be a commotion.","My label in Toronto was 'Stand Pat' and I think that was a fair assessment. I tried to be patient, but if a trade came along - big or small - that I thought should be made, I would make it.","Baseball is about talent, hard work, and strategy. But at the deepest level, it's about love, integrity, and respect.","I was lucky to go to work every day for 50 years, to a job that I loved.","Texting is a lot like an answering machine. If you don't want to talk to somebody, it's like screening your calls. To me, it's a way of communication, but not one that I favor.","What was the first name of the Houston club? It wasn't the Astros. It was the Colt .45s. A lot of guys now will say Colt 45 is a beer. But it was also a pistol, and it went right with Texas.","For me, the most important thing is running a good clubhouse. The X's and the O's - you sit up in the stands and, for the most part, a lot of fans go to the game and they know what's going to happen. You're going to hit and run, steal, put a pitcher in, take a pitcher out.","At the high school level, the coaches get these kids in revenue-driven sports and take them away from baseball. There's so much pressure on these kids to even play spring football. We need to get the African-American players back in the game, which I think would make it not only a better game, but more exciting and entertaining for everyone.","If I was involved with the NFL, I'd seriously consider adopting some of the rules used in Canada. I've heard, unofficially, of course, some NFL club owners have talked about adding a feature or two. The NFL went for the two-point conversion. Professional sport is entertainment, and the CFL, I believe, is ahead of the NFL in that regard.","Safeco Field is a lot like a National League park. Because of that, we're more of a pitching-defensive type club. Anaheim and Oakland - and even Texas - are more offensive oriented. We're a club that doesn't blow anybody out, but at the same time we don't get blown out much. We're in most of the games."],"Pat Mastelotto":["My drumming is always an experiment.","We're looking to help our guitar buddies do their thing while at the same time we try to create something we might enjoy listening to ourselves. If anything we are trying to develop a vocabulary so we can converse more fluidly.","Sorry, no, I'm never satisfied with my drumming.","My roots are more in he Beatles, Zeppelin, the whole 60's side.","We have a very loyal fan base, the kind tat buys the record the day it comes out, sees every show, and that's fantastic, but what about the people who would never hear about our band?","Not really, drums found me, I just liked music, all kinds of music.","If Bill jumps into something that relies on a lot of cymbals, I'll jump into something that relies on a lot of skin sounds; if he goes into metal tones, I'll go into wood, and so on. I basically play in his holes.","I think basically lables were more interested in a Richard Page record than a Mr. Mister record.","I love to play with Tony and Bill anytime, anywhere.","I like tinkering with the tribe beat boxes and love using Reason as a beefed up beat box.","I like almost everything, even country twang, disco, blue grass and accordions.","I don't know of any plans to remaster the Mr Mister catalog.","Crim has baggage: expectation, history, responsibility."],"Pat McGrath":["For blue eyes, use warm browns, peaches, and yellows to compliment the eyes. Brown and hazel eyes sparkle in blue and purple shades, which flatters the orange undertone of brown eyes. Green eyes stand out in burgundy and plum shades like CoverGirl Queen Collection Vivid Impact Eyeliner in Cabernet.","From the beginning of my career, I've used makeup as a vehicle to express my vision, my obsessions, inspirations, and addictions. There's nothing more rewarding than seeing young people recreate some of my iconic looks.","Social media has revolutionised how beauty is curated, captured, and consumed.","I've always believed that the most extraordinary results occur only when one feels unbound by any notion of constraint or limitation.","When I was a child, the world of makeup was so different. There wasn't the wide range of shades available for darker skin tones like there is now.","My earliest memory was watching my mother do her makeup. She was obsessed with beauty and collected makeup and experimented with it. I think it's a lot of young men and women's experiences, growing up: watching the ritual of what their mothers would do.","That's the best pigment, anyways: something that works for everyone because it's just so rich.","I love to look at all those young artists' work and then bring them in, have them work with me at shows.","I just loved makeup. My mother loved it as well - and was obsessed by the fact that we couldn't find any makeup for dark skin.","I knew I wasn't going to make money in the beginning, so I found another way to support myself - I was a receptionist. It's quite smart to work that way. Otherwise, you get vicious and desperate, and no one wants to work with you. Build your career slowly; then people start to trust you and pay you well.","I don't go to the spa or get my hair done enough. I don't go to the gym enough. But I do take five, six weeks' vacation; the industry does.","I'd go into a department store now and buy everything. It's who I am. I just love cosmetics.","You couldn't get anyone more makeup-addicted than me.","I wear very natural makeup, but it's made up out of five foundations to make that perfect skin, and my lipstick might be three different lipsticks mixed together, so it's a kind of obsession in a different way.","I think you always want things to get better, and that's been my view ever since I've been in this industry. So it's great to see there's more diversity, but it could always get better.","I'm the ultimate beauty junkie - that inspiration, obsession, and addiction is one of the main reasons I founded Pat McGrath Labs in 2015. So, when fellow beauty junkies spot me, there's nothing I enjoy more than discovering what they're addicted to. It's so inspiring!","Everyone needs Skin Fetish 003 in their kit. It's the ultimate everyday essential for runway skin that looks as legendary in the office or on the street or as it does on social media.","Anyone who knows or works with me knows I don't believe there's such a thing as a 'mistake.' With that in mind, I celebrate all aspects of makeup and find something beautiful in all 'trends.'","My mother was my first and most important influence. When I was a little girl, she would take me shopping for pigments that flattered dark skin tones, mixing and playing until she'd created her ideal shade.","My intention when I created Labs was that the people that used our products would be empowered to explore a fearless, daring attitude towards makeup - that's why we always write 'Use Without Caution' on everything we make.","What sets Labs apart from other brands is the emphasis on the user experience within the products themselves by embracing the technologies that are changing the face of the beauty and the marketplace of the industry. Simply, the Lab is where unadulterated experimentation meets raw glamour: a rule-breaking playground for makeup enthusiasts.","At the end of summer, I go on a detox because I know I need a clear mind for Fashion Week. You need a lot of energy, and the ability to focus, in preparation for this craziness. I go to the gym, too, just to make sure I have the endurance to keep up with everything.","I look for anything new and inspiring - in the worlds of makeup but also jewelry and decor. I never know what will inspire me.","My team can be as big as 50 during the busiest days of Fashion Week. I can travel with up to 75 bags of products and materials. And between shows, I personally travel on motorbike to speed through traffic and get to the next venue.","You can't be lazy in fashion. You're always going to be surprised.","When I'm home in New York, I wake up early so I can check e-mails and call my London agent, and start my day with a cup of Ristretto cofee from my Nespresso machine.","My beauty regimen is simple but concise: I exfoliate my face once a week, then cleanse. If my skin needs an extra boost, I use SK-II Facial Treatment Mask and SK-II Eye Mask for about 20 minutes. It's the best thing for a healthy, glowing complexion.","My makeup routine is a small amount of base, a mascara, nude eye shadow, and a lip balm or a gloss. When I go out at night, I wear a blusher and tons and tons of mascara - very easy, very fresh, very light. I can't sit around doing my own makeup all day - I wish I could.","For fragrance, I apply a custom blend of essential oils and perfumes. I love spritzing Michelle Roques-O'Neil's Restore Therapie Aura Spray, which is an infusion that instantly rebuilds your energy.","I think with beauty there is so much to be done. A pill that will give you everlasting youth. To choose the exact age you want to stay at from a hundred pill bottles? That would be fun.","It would be great if perfect skin required less work. That would be the best ever.","I'm such a product junkie - I love trying new products and new shades. For me, it's really exciting to see what new and wonderful products come onto the market.","For me, a really good mascara is such a must-have, and I rarely leave the house without it! Another must-have of mine is concealer: it really is so versatile and acts as a great pick-me-up during the day.","Before the lipstick goes anywhere near the lips, I like to apply a tiny amount of foundation or concealer to create a really great base. This then makes it easier to guide the bullet of the lipstick along the lip outline.","Music permeates everything I do. I love everything from Grace Jones to Nicki Minaj to Underworld to D.J. MikeQ and beyond. Music is integral to my personal inspiration.","It's amazing to be an incubator. Many of my muses have gone on to other brands.","Makeup is malleable and mercurial: The biggest joy I have every day is the opportunity to create, to play, and to invent with something I've loved forever.","Makeup is an extraordinary tool that allows me to share my inspirations, my fantasies, and my vision with the world.","What I love most about makeup is that you can't get attached to one thing, one idea, or one approach - and once you've achieved perfection, you have to wipe it all off and start over the next day.","Something most people don't know about me is that I'm obsessed with technology. With that in mind, the 'material' I'd most like to experiment is the material that has yet to be invented.","I walk into the most incredible fashion houses and see the most incredible things - new technology, new ideas, new music. Incredible lighting, new girls.","Sometimes nothing happens at a show for the first two hours, and in the last hour, we have to do all 70 girls. It's an adrenaline rush.","For a fast touch-up, mix a lipstick with a little bit of balm to create a stain. You can also use your foundation as a concealer.","You can't do shiny skin for high-definition cameras without it looking awful. HD shows off all of your imperfections. Even selfies require a flawless finish.","When you put on foundation with a brush, it's a heavy finish - but if you use a brush and then blend, it looks more like a moisturizer and much prettier. Then add concealer - applied with a fine brush - to the problem areas afterward.","The fatter the eyeliner, the easier it is to use. With a pencil, just draw the shape you like and clean up the mistakes with a bit of cleanser.","Every single member of my Artistry and Pat McGrath Labs Brand Teams - making this dream a reality would not be possible without them.","Let the people you love know that you truly love them.","Channel your heartbreak into work, then use that extra money to treat yourself to a new handbag.","There's nothing better than a woman who has aged wonderfully.","Both liquid and pencil eyeliner can be used on the top and bottom eyes. I then use eye shadow over the pencil to blend evenly to ensure there's no skipping and patchiness. With pencil as a base, it's easier to get a seamlessly blended effect. If a stronger line is desired, trace over the pencil line with liquid eyeliner.","Use colors on eyes that contrast with the iris to make eyes appear more vibrant.","It's amazing to know that my work as a Artist can influence women around the world, and my visions for new products can shape the future of beauty for women.","When I'm on set, I must focus on other people's make-up, not on mine.","Apply the lipstick first and then the gloss in the middle of the lips to add a touch of light.","It takes time to reach the perfect shade and formulations. That's something that's in the science.","The lipstick, to make a matte that feels like heaven, is unheard of.","I don't think there's ever going to be a time when metallics aren't going to be in. They're so gorgeous, they bring so much dimension to the face, they're easy to wear regardless of age or skin tone, and really, they're just a lot of fun.","Thin applications and small amounts in the right places is kind of the way to go with metallics for every day.","Whether it be a bolder lip, a dewier cheek, a more lush lash, or an exceptionally extravagant eye, no time is better than the present for unleashing your cosmetic creativity.","I've always wanted to have my own business, but not in the traditional sense... I always found that quite off-putting. I just wanted to be different."],"Pat Meehan":["You do what is manageable, and you do it well rather than trying to do a thousand things just a little bit OK.","There's an excitement to officiating a well-played game. A lot of discretion, a lot of judgment comes into play.","I think I've had the opportunity to work for people because I wanted to and because I thought they were good people, and therefore everything I do, I can do with sincerity.","I would consider myself to be a moderate Republican, but more important than that, I believe our system of government is the best system there is... and while I have no illusions of changing the world, I've had good opportunities in life, and I believe there's an obligation to give something back by participating.","Whenever you manage more than 100 attorneys, there's always going to be attorneys who believe that someone isn't as good as they are."],"Pat Metheny":["I'm always trying to find 'connections' between things. That art is the juxtaposition of a lot of things that seem unrelated but add up to something recognizable.","For me, let's keep jazz as folk music. Let's not make jazz classical music. Let's keep it as street music, as people's everyday-life music. Let's see jazz musicians continue to use the materials, the tools, the spirit of the actual time that they're living in, as what they build their lives as musicians around.","The guitar for me is a translation device. It's not a goal. And in some ways, jazz isn't a destination for me. For me, jazz is a vehicle that takes you to the true destination - a musical one that describes all kinds of stuff about the human condition and the way music works.","One of the things jazz has always excelled at is translating the reality of the times through its musical prism.","Listening is the key to everything good in music.","My older brother Mike is an excellent trumpet player. By the time he was 12, he was playing around Kansas City in classical situations. He was already an amazing talent.","I saw A Hard Day's Night 12 or 13 times.","I was deep in the zone of practicing almost constantly.","The beauty of jazz is that it's malleable. People are addressing it to suit their own personalities.","I think jazz is actually quite unforgiving in its disdain for nostalgia. It demands creativity and change at its highest level.","The pianist Cecil Taylor is extremely melodic; the guitarist Derek Bailey is extremely melodic, and Ornette Coleman.","I love playing and working on music. It is something that I feel really lucky to be able to spend my life doing. And I don't sleep much!","From 1962 to 1965, the guitar became this icon of youth culture, thanks mostly to the Beatles.","I don't know if I would qualify as mainstream. I think I have managed to function pretty successfully on the fringes of the music world and have been able to play exactly what I have wanted the way I have wanted.","I don't worry too much about the fundamentalist principles that are in almost any discussion about jazz.","I hate the way chorus boxes sound.","I realized that equipment really had little to do with why I sound like the way I sound.","I think I have a basic sound aesthetic that is in most of what I do.","I think I represent a more left-wing view of what jazz is.","I was able to work with the best musicians in Kansas City starting when I was really young.","It's more about conception and touch and spirit and soul than whether my hardware was in place.","Jazz is not something that can be defined through blunt instruments. It is much more poetic than that.","People sometimes say it takes a long time to become a jazz fan, but for me it took about five seconds.","The first thing I learned was the theme from Peter Gunn.","Whatever my recorded output is, it's a reflection of a general love of music.","If you come to my house, you won't see a wall of trophies or things like that. I'm sort of 'on to the next thing' all the time.","What I look for in musicians is a sense of infinity.","There are musicians who go through their lives sort of shedding their skins. For me, I've always felt backward-compatible to Version 1.0.","I'm always inspired when there's a robustness to the material in front of me.","When talking about writing, I often use the analogy of archaeology. There are these great tunes all around. Your skill as a musician allows you to pick them out without breaking them.","No two notes are ever the same volume. With the guitar, you really have to model in your mind this wider thing; you're trying to create the illusion of a bigger dynamic range.","I would always contend that talent is an element, but over the long run, ultimately, a minor part of it all; it is mostly hard work.","There are some musicians who are talented and see themselves as some kind of natural geniuses or something because of a certain amount of natural ability. But that is often rarely the case over the long term.","I can't really say enough about Chris Potter. He is one of the greatest musicians I have ever known, and every second I have been on the band stand with him has been an absolute pleasure.","A lot of jazz artists think people should like what they're doing just because it's jazz. I don't buy that.","I didn't want there to be a computer on stage. When I see people with computers on stage, I think, 'Are you sending e-mail?' That's so corny.","I used to love going and playing jam sessions, doing things spontaneously. I can't do that anymore. Everything you do is documented, nothing is casual anymore.","I'm triggering acoustic instruments. I'm literally beating, smacking, hitting, blowing, doing physical things. It's an incredibly exciting way to make music.","Someone who knew me when I was 14 said I was the oldest 14-year-old on the planet. Now I'm a 14-year-old who is 60.","If we are going to list guitar influences, the biggest one by far is Wes Montgomery. Also, Gary Burton was obviously huge for me in a number of ways. But beyond that, Clifford Brown, Miles Davis and Freddie Hubbard.","I have three young kids and a great family. I love hanging out with them more than anything.","The reality of music itself, which is the fabric of life for me, is where most of my attention is.","Somehow, trumpet is the reference point for me - it was actually my first instrument.","'The Unity Band' project has been life-changing for me. I have led many groups of talented musicians, but this is unlike anything else."],"Pat Mitchell":["As long as I'm learning every day of my life, I will never feel old. Never. And I don't feel old; I feel in my head and in my heart - I don't know, ageless!","Investing in women and girls may once have been considered a radical notion or even a waste of resources, but in most places in the world today, women and girls are increasingly recognized as a critical link to greater prosperity, political stability, better health and public policy.","I think journalists and filmmakers are keen observers. And actors must also be sharp observers as they draw their characters and their stories from what they experience around them. After all, that is what actors, filmmakers, journalists are trained to be: observers. And then they do something with their observations.","I spend a lot of time on college campuses, a lot of time mentoring young women in all sectors of business, because I don't want them to spend as much time to get their voice as I did.","Media and technology are our greatest assets. And yet, they are our most undervalued and underused assets. Now when I say that, people look at me like I'm crazy because every young person we know in the world is never without media, ever.","TED Women isn't championing a cause; it's surfacing and sharing some of the most important ideas of our time. Our focus is on women as change agents, innovators and idea champions, and I think people will be both inspired and surprised by the program. We're exploring some fascinating territory!","TED Women will focus on the ideas and innovations championed by women and girls. These cover everything from community development to economic growth to biodynamic farming to robotics to medical treatments to the use of technology for personal safety and peace making."],"Pat Morita":["I don't know of any other creature on earth other than man that will sit in a corner and cry because of some painful experience in the past.","The idea of a Japanese comedian was not only a rarity, it was non-existent.","Only in America could you get away with the kind of comedy I did.","I began in an era where four-letter words were not allowed.","You may have heard that back in the States there are some people who are smoking grass. I don't know how you feel, but it's sure easier than cutting the stuff.","I still have a young attitude.","I've been working on my autobiography, just pecking away in longhand. The more you write, the more you remember. The more you remember, the more detail you recall. It's not all pleasant!","A lot happens in 20 years.","Hip Nip just sounds groovy. A drummer laid it on me.","I'm awkward at these things. Just being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for Karate Kid was a real surprise and I was a little uncomfortable.","I didn't have a childhood.","It's been a career filled with very low valleys and some wonderful, high peaks.","Thanks to the Japanese and Geronimo, John Wayne became a millionaire.","I went from being an ailing child to a public enemy.","I never was able to do karate. That's calling me a good actor. I act like I can do anything.","I'm in semi-retirement, but what am I going to retire to? I don't ride horses, I don't golf anymore. I shoot a game of pool every now and then."],"Pat Nixon":["I never have tantrums. If anything makes me mad, I'm silent. If I'm not talking, leave me alone.","I've been blessed with a wonderful husband, two caring daughters and sons-in-law, and four really special grandchildren. They have each enhanced my life.","I love my husband. I believe in him, and I am proud of his accomplishments.","All lives have triumphs and tragedies, laughter and tears, and mine has been no different. What really matters is whether, after all of that, you remain strong and a comfort to your loved ones. I have tried to meet that test.","I feel there's enough seriousness in the world without seeing it in the theatre.","I'm a perfectionist. I won't do a thing without trying to do it well.","I do or die, but I never cancel out.","It takes heart to be in political life.","I always look forward, not back.","I don't have time to be depressed.","If I had a choice, I'd rather be admired less and have my husband tormented less. I'd prefer that people concentrate on a fair assessment of him and his Presidency.","The truth sustains me.","Being first lady is the hardest unpaid job in the world.","I'll have to have a room of my own. Nobody could sleep with Dick. He wakes up during the night, switches on the lights, speaks into his tape recorder.","I have sacrificed everything in my life that I consider precious to advance the political career of my husband.","I only know what I read in the papers.","I didn't know what it was not to work hard as I grew up.","I have made my own decisions ever since my father died.","All lives have triumphs and tragedies, laughter and tears, and mine has been no different.","I have always tried my best to do what I thought was the right thing at the time.","I think a person has to just be herself.","I'd like to work on job and educational opportunities for all.","I don't have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with.","I never had time to dream about being anyone else.","I have a very positive outlook."],"Pat Oliphant":["I can always see what I've done wrong. I'm always learning. I'm the perennial student.","I hate changes of administrations, because I have all my villains in place and they are all taken away and replaced with faceless wonders nobody knows.","There has always been quite a strong black and white art tradition in Australia, with quite a large contingent of cartoonists, given the size of the population.","I've always looked upon politics as a very boring thing. Politics never interested me as much as the people involved in it.","We're all idealistic when young.","Journalism was looked upon as a more noble thing than it is now. I don't know if it carries the same cachet that it did then.","An outsider's point of view is always handy.","Even if you go to Australia today, it's very much like visiting a state you haven't been to.","I've been in Washington ever since 1981, trying to get out!","If it were not for the fact that editors have become so timorous in these politically correct times, I would probably have a greater readership than I have.","One-newspaper towns are not good because all the surviving newspaper does is print money. They make 25 percent on their money every year, and if they go down to 22 percent, they start laying people off.","There were dragons to slay in the old days. Nixon was a good dragon.","I see myself as an artist who happens to do cartoons.","So many cartoonists draw the same year after year. When they find a style, they stick with it. They don't mess with innovation, and they become boring.","I don't think there's more than half-a-dozen cartoons that I've been really truly happy with in all the time I've been doing it.","Some days you feel like this is really going well. You can tell. Other days, you're just drawing like a farmer and you don't know why.","The fact that we're protected under that Constitution in exercising the right of free speech, it's a wonderful thing. You've got to come from somewhere else to realize how valuable it is."],"Pat Paulsen":["The No. 1 cause of forest fires is trees.","All the problems we face in the United States today can be traced to an unenlightened immigration policy on the part of the American Indian.","I will not claim I will solve all the world's problems by myself. If I did, I'd have to run as a Republican or a Democrat.","Yeah, I'm running for the White House again. Well, it's not a run, really; it's sort of a brisk walk.","I admit I do have some drawbacks and limitations as a candidate. Although I am a professional comedian, some of my critics maintain that this is not enough. I cannot deny that I stand before you untested and inexperienced - I only spent two years in television, never as a romantic lead or a song and dance man.","It's tough campaigning, kissing hands and shaking babies.","We've got to step up our conservation efforts before it's too late. We're not protecting our lands and natural resources. Take the Grand Canyon for example; I'm sure that at one time it was a beautiful piece of land, and just look at the way we've let it go.","Now that my wine has been served in the White House, why not me? Who could talk to farmers better than I? Somebody even asked me the other day if I had anything in my platform about taxes. 'Hell yes,' I said. 'Great state. But I wouldn't want to live there.'","Only a cheap politician, greedy for political gain, would try to single out one individual for blame. The fault lies not with the individual but with the system, and that system is Richard Nixon.","You can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time, but you can only make a monkey out of the voters every four years!","I've upped my standards. Now, up yours.","I read an article that said one in five Americans thinks Elvis is alive. I want to find those morons and get them registered to vote for me.","The Clinton Administration has turned out to be a boon. I knew that he would be wonderful, I just knew it from the beginning. From Arkansas? Shoot.","I like to pour my wines for people. I watch their eyes, I can see what they'll like. Most people say they don't like dry wine because they haven't had a dry wine that's clean and fruity, instead of a big, oaky thing.","I once told Tommy Smothers, 'If I could just get the money and the women straightened out, the rest of my life would be easy.'","Wine is something to enjoy. We get sick and tired of people who pick it apart and talk about its 'saucy nuances.'","I don't need adult supervision.","I am neither left wing nor right wing. I am middle-of-the-bird.","You have to understand, I can't do any jokes about Ross Perot, because the last thing I need right now is another credit check.","Should we continue to spend billions to subsidize foreign military dictatorships, or should we concentrate on taking better care of the one we have right here at home?","I'd learned some things. I knew you weren't supposed to hold a good wine at the top - the paper bag falls off.","Assuming either the Left Wing or the Right Wing gained control of the country, it would probably fly around in circles.","If elected, I will win.","Will I obliterate national debt? Sure, why not?","The last few years of my life have been a little like a long ride in a Poop de Ville with the bottom down.","So I got into growing grapes, not realizing that there was a heck of a lot more to it than meets the eye.","We have nothing to fear but fear itself... and, of course, the boogieman.","I've been on the campaign trail so long, some of my wine has turned to vinegar.","Actually, my wine was served at the White House twice. Reagan must have been asleep when he ordered it.","I came down to Orange because I sold the Smothers Brothers a song called 'Chocolate,' and that gave me enough money to move down here. I was washing windows down in Orange County when they called me up and said they wanted me to do their TV show.","We must remember that as the centuries go by, time will pass.","As I've always said: The future lies ahead.","I want to caucus in Iowa. I'll caucus all over the state. I don't caucus in California. You don't caucus where you live. It doesn't look good.","Deep down, I happen to be very shallow.","I think I'd make a pretty good president, and they have a great pension plan.","If you're old enough to be arrested, you're old enough to carry a gun.","Having a comic in the White House will assure stability in foreign relations. The world will continue to respond to foreign initiatives by saying, 'You must be joking.'","The federal government spends millions to run the Postal Service. I could lose your mail for half of that.","Only 10 percent of the people in the U.S. like dry wines. You shouldn't get down on people just because they like a little sugar.","In America, any boy can grow up to become president. Or, if he never grows up, vice president.","Presidents tend to tinker, you know, and mess everything up.","People come up to me in bars and on street corners and they say to me, 'Hey, Paulsen, have you got any change?'","A gun is a necessity. Who knows if you're walking down a street and you spot a moose?","I think we should just tip the government if it does a good job. Fifteen percent is the standard tip, isn't it?"],"Pat Quinn":["I have a job to do on policy. And I think that's what people want their governor to do. Not politics, policy.","I will never be an insider. I want to be the champion of people who don't have insiders and lobbyists supporting them.","I don't aspire to have high approval ratings. I aspire, in light of my two predecessors, to be the most honest governor I can be. I'd rather focus on honesty than popularity."],"Pat Riley":["If you have a positive attitude and constantly strive to give your best effort, eventually you will overcome your immediate problems and find you are ready for greater challenges.","Excellence is the gradual result of always striving to do better.","Each Warrior wants to leave the mark of his will, his signature, on important acts he touches. This is not the voice of ego but of the human spirit, rising up and declaring that it has something to contribute to the solution of the hardest problems, no matter how vexing!","A champion needs a motivation above and beyond winning.","There can only be one state of mind as you approach any profound test; total concentration, a spirit of togetherness, and strength.","Being ready isn't enough; you have to be prepared for a promotion or any other significant change.","You have no choices about how you lose, but you do have a choice about how you come back and prepare to win again.","There's always the motivation of wanting to win. Everybody has that. But a champion needs, in his attitude, a motivation above and beyond winning.","To have long term success as a coach or in any position of leadership, you have to be obsessed in some way.","Giving yourself permission to lose guarantees a loss.","Management must speak with one voice. When it doesn't management itself becomes a peripheral opponent to the team's mission.","There's no such thing as coulda, shoulda, or woulda. If you shoulda and coulda, you woulda done it.","A particular shot or way of moving the ball can be a player's personal signature, but efficiency of performance is what wins the game for the team.","Great effort springs naturally from great attitude.","When a great team loses through complacency, it will constantly search for new and more intricate explanations to explain away defeat.","Look for your choices, pick the best one, then go with it.","Being a part of success is more important than being personally indispensable.","You have to defeat a great players aura more than his game.","The Ten Commandments were not a suggestion.","Discipline is not a nasty word.","Don't let other people tell you what you want.","Public life is regarded as the crown of a career, and to young men it is the worthiest ambition. Politics is still the greatest and the most honorable adventure.","Whatever it takes to win.","People who create 20% of the results will begin believing they deserve 80% of the rewards.","You can never have enough talent.","All I did from day-to-day is coach. That's what my job was, that's what my passion was, and the fact that now it's something I'm being considered for is just mind-blowing to me, that I would ever be in that kind of company."],"Pat Roberts":["Security for agriculture merits serious concern by not only the agricultural community but our nation as a whole. The risk to the U.S. food supply and overall economy is real.","First, I have the privilege of being Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. It is not an oxymoron I assure you.","Despite the generous rewards that state juries dole out, in many cases, victims receive less than 50 cents on the dollar in settlements with the lawyers taking the rest. This is not justice.","We need to continue our full support of the nascent Iraqi government by helping to rebuild their economic infrastructure and maintain security while training the Iraqi security forces.","Throughout the world, terrorists are actively seeking their next recruit. Alarmingly, terrorist organizations are increasingly targeting school-age children as the next generation of terrorists.","I full well realize that politics is a rough and tumble business, but politics should not be reduced to lobbing partisan hand grenades. Politics is not war. Terrorism is.","Mr. President, it may surprise my colleagues, but I am no fan of federal disaster programs for agriculture. They are difficult to pass and often a disaster to implement.","With our Reserve and Guard units playing increasingly important roles in the war on terror and in Iraq, it is unacceptable to make them jump through any unnecessary hurdles.","I know there is moral outage in regard to Mr. Milosevic, and that is certainly justified. But what about our response?","We will fight evil, but we will do it from above 15,000 feet."],"Pat Robertson":["Feminism encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism and become lesbians.","There's no question that jihad historically means war.","My friend Jerry Falwell was the one who said it, and he was a guest on my show, and it's hard to take the blame for everybody who shows up on your show.","Well, what was called the blessed hope of the Bible is that one day Jesus Christ would come back again, start a whole new era, that this world order that we know it would change into something that would be wonderful that we'd call the millennium.","I have a zero tolerance for sanctimonious morons who try to scare people.","Feminism is a socialist, anti-family, political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism and become lesbians.","Abortion's a private decision. But I just think it shouldn't be federalized.","The Supreme Court has insulted you over and over again, Lord. They've taken your Bible away from the schools. They've forbidden little children to pray. They've taken the knowledge of God as best they can, and organizations have come into court to take the knowledge of God out of the public square of America.","I mean, if a person acts irresponsibly in his own life, he will pay the consequences. And it's not so much divine retribution as it's built into the law of nature.","The founding document of the United States of America acknowledges the Lordship of Jesus Christ because we are a Christian nation.","Are we a Christian nation now? It's doubtful. But did we start out as one? Without question.","People who hate God... take it out on innocent people.","The truth is, the secular world isn't too enamored with Jesus. And they're not too enamored with someone who is leading people to Jesus. So if you're out there talking about people's sins, and you're talking about righteousness, you will get pushback. Jesus Himself did. The apostles did. I mean, there's persecution all up and down the line.","It seems to me the Washington Monument is a symbol of America's power. It has been the symbol of our great nation. We look at the symbol and we say 'this is one nation under God.'","Well the basic thesis is that there's a god in heaven who is all powerful who wants to help people. And that - he will answer prayer, and does miraculous things in people's lives. And so I've documented some of these wonderful things.","I also pray for favor and His anointing on my life and ministry that I might have spiritual blessing when I minister to people. They're my principal prayers; I don't have a prayer list that I go down.","I know one man who was impotent who gave AIDS to his wife and the only thing they did was kiss.","You know, the Brits had a way of - running an empire. And I don't think America is comfortable with an empire.","Jesus Christ is a prince of peace. He told us to live in peace. He told us to love our enemies. He told us to do good to them that spitefully use us.","Dominican Republic is, is prosperous, healthy, full of resorts, etcetera.","And I think that George Bush really is a very godly person.","And I think the blessing of heaven is on Bush. It's just the way it is.","And it's one thing to give people freedom and something else to deny the rights of Christians to assert their faith in order to keep Hindus from feeling upset.","And these things are pretty much foundational: thou shall not kill, steal, bear false witness. All these things are embedded into the laws we enjoy in our nation.","But I never, never thought of the ministry nor did - of course, television when I was growing up, there was no television. So I didn't know anything about it.","But if there's an erosion at home, you know, Thomas Jefferson warned about a tyranny of an oligarchy and if we surrender our democracy to the tyranny of an oligarchy, we've made a terrible mistake.","But there's no reason why we should abdicate our foundational principles because certain groups don't believe in them. You know, no majority should surrender its deeply held beliefs to those who don't believe in anything.","I cite in my book countless examples of the foundational documents of the colonial period in America and the writings of the leaders, that this was intended to be a Christian nation.","I mean, George Bush is a man of prayer. He talks to the lord. He tries to get his direction from the lord.","I think George Allen from Virginia was a distinguished governor, he's a distinguished senator and head of the Senatorial Campaign Committee and won some significant victories. He is a very attractive guy and would make a tremendous president.","I think the Democrats are catering to them, but, you know, in the entire history of the United States of America, there has never been a judge who has been refused a vote when there was a majority of Senators willing to vote for his confirmation, never in history.","I would never say somebody had to vote for anybody. That would be terrible. I haven't said that.","If you look over the course of a hundred years, I think the gradual erosion of the consensus that's held our country together is probably more serious than a few bearded terrorists who fly into buildings.","In 1998, I founded the American Center for Law and Justice, probably the premier public interest law firm in America defending the rights of believers.","It's the tyranny of an oligarchy that I'm concerned about.","McCain I'd vote against under any circumstance.","The problem we have in America is the systematic erosion of our religious values in an attempt by certain liberal groups to expunge our Christian heritage from the public square.","The Ten Commandments are the most visible symbol because these commandments are recognized by Christians and Jews alike as being the foundation of our system of public morality.","There are times in history where a particular doctrine becomes a symbol of a greater problem.","There's an assault on human sexuality, as Judge Scalia said, they've taken sides in the culture war and on top of that if we have a democracy, the democratic processes should be that we can elect representatives who will share our point of view and vote those things into law.","Well, you know, Thomas Jefferson, who was the author of the Declaration of Independence said he wouldn't have any atheists in his cabinet because atheists wouldn't swear an oath to God. That was Jefferson and we have never had any Muslims in the cabinet.","What I heard was that Bush is now positioned to have victory after victory. He'll have Social Security reform passed, that he'll have tax reform passed, that he'll have conservative judges on the courts.","Is there in all the history of human folly a greater fool than a clergymen in politics?","It is the Democratic Congress, the liberal-biased media and the homosexuals who want to destroy all Christians.","Many of those people involved in Adolf Hitler were Satanists, many were homosexuals - the two things seem to go together.","Homosexuals are riding high in the media.","In Europe, the big word is tolerance. You tolerate everything.","I believe in working with the hearts of people, and not locking them up.","Islam is a violent, I was going to say religion, but it's not a religion. It's a political system. It's a violent political system bent on the overthrow of the governments of the world and world domination. That is the ultimate aim.","I have a relatively good track record.","We will see the presence of angels and we will see an intensification of miracles around the world.","Well - I was brought up as a Southern Baptist.","I have friends who are Roman Catholics. I have friends who are Lutherans.","My wife attends a Presbyterian church.","I'm evangelical.","The thought about Republicans is, we're supposed to be Jeffersonian. That government governs the best that governs the least.","I mean the terrorists are - are like a pimple, like a boil. They'll go away.","I'm concerned about - the oppression of the poor.","The Democratic Party went far to the left, I think, and left some of us stranded on the beach, so we went to the Republican Party.","If you read back in the Bible, the letter of the apostle Paul to the church of Thessalonia, he said that in the latter days before the end of the age that the Earth would be caught up in what he called the birth pangs of a new order.","The Constitution was made for ordinary people.","Well, actually, I manage a couple of stock portfolios or funds or whatever you want to call 'em, and I think I've done relatively well with them.","You can imagine, if somebody's approaching retirement, and all of a sudden the funds that he or she is depending on is depleted by 50% or however many, it gives them a sinking feeling in the pit of their stomach.","I wouldn't want to be President now!","The wisdom of God's Word is quite clear on believers being unequally yoked. And marrying someone who is not a Christian - who is not a daily disciple of Christ - is being unequally yoked, regardless of what their beliefs might be.","I've been to Israel many times - I've lost count of how many times.","For decades, I have supported adoption, and have helped tens of thousands of children worldwide.","Adoptive parents are taking on enormous responsibility, both emotionally and financially. Quite frankly, they need as much disclosure as possible about the child's background and health to assure the best fit and be prepared.","Anything's possible in politics.","It's just impossible to ignore the activists in your party. These are the people who stuff the envelopes, and walk the precincts, and make the telephone calls, and do all the so-called grunt work that brings about a successful campaign.","I'm a person that just likes to speak the truth, and I don't understand why in America it's such a big deal that we won't read the Koran and we won't look at history.","Of course there are peace-loving Muslims.","My father was a lawyer.","You know, Saint Augustine said our hearts are restless 'til they rest in thee. And I had a restlessness in my heart. Something just wasn't quite right.","I'm a religious broadcaster.","I've managed stations.","I've personally backed off from direct political involvement.","I hate Alzheimer's. It is one of the most awful things because, here is a loved one, this is the woman or man that you have loved for 20, 30, 40 years, and suddenly, that person is gone. They're gone. They are gone.","When I was in charge of the Christian Coalition I was available to mobilize grass roots support for somebody.","We don't want a president who fails at domestic and foreign policy.","The Katrina matter was terrible.","The rebuilding of Iraq has been terrible.","I am remarkably pleased with Obama. I had grave misgivings about him.","Haiti is in desperate poverty.","I'm parodied as being some right-wing fundamentalist extremist, it just isn't true. The parody doesn't reflect reality.","Every time the liberals pass a bill - I don't care what it involves - they stick criminal sanctions on it. They don't feel there is any way people are going to keep a law unless they can put them in jail.","I just think it's shocking how many of these young people wind up in prison and they get turned into hardcore criminals because they had a possession of a very small amount of controlled substance.","God created the world; the laws of nature were created by God. True science tries to find out what God put in the world. The trouble is where scientists speculate about theology and they don't know what they're talking about because they weren't there. They can't speculate about the origins of life because they weren't there.","I thought that communism, the tyranny of communism, was an abomination and I beseeched God to bring that terrible evil down and he did. It was a great triumph, it took awhile, but it happened.","I think we do want a front-runner from the Republican Party who can win the general election.","Something happened a long time ago in Haiti, and people might not want to talk about it. They were under the heel of the French... and they got together and swore a pact to the devil."],"Pat Sajak":["I'm more concerned about members of Congress being drug-free than I am about members of the Yankees or Giants.","That's the trouble with trying to influence an undecided voter. First you have to find one.","The most important political task facing the out-of-power party - the Democrats for now - is creating a villain to run against. It's certainly easier than developing some grand new ideas or policies on which to campaign.","It seems to me we have been in a rhetorical arms race in this country, with each side unwilling to lay down its weapons for fear - usually justified - the other side would beat them to a pulp.","Anyone who has seen me spin that heavy, giant wheel on television knows that I'm not a steroid user.","There is a certain comfort in waking up and finding that Michael Jackson is still the Big Story. At least it tells you that nothing horrible has happened in the world that would force them to move on to real news.","I wouldn't be surprised to learn that Clinton cost John Kerry more votes than he gained for him whenever they appeared together. Imagine being part of a crowd enraptured by the presence of Bill Clinton, and then having to listen to a speech by John Kerry!","I said yes, which turned out to be the right answer.","If I went in to pitch this show to a network, I would be laughed out of the room.","Sometimes you just stumble into something that works, and here I am a quarter of a century later.","Being a conservative in Hollywood is like walking into a shooting range with a bull's-eye attached to your body. There are more of us than you would believe, but if you want to keep working, you feel like you have to keep quiet."],"Pat Summerall":["When someone saves your life and gives you life, there's gratitude, humility; there's a time you've been so blessed you realize you've been given another chance at life that maybe you did or didn't deserve.","Well, to take me from where I was, and the life I was leading, to the life I lead now with the church and with the Lord and with Jesus Christ, it's a total, total turn-around.","There were a couple of things in the intervention that made me know I needed help. One was a letter from my daughter saying that she was ashamed she had the same last name as I did, which will shock you a little bit.","So, I didn't get moved up because of celebrity status or anything like that. I got in line, and I passed the test. And they realized that I was sick enough, and as soon as the liver became available, I got one.","Seemed like everything I tried to do in broadcasting and as a player before that turned out successfully. I was succeeding. I got to the top of the heap in every facet of broadcasting.","My MELD score was pretty high. And the worse you get on that scale, the sooner you get a transplant. It's based on how sick you are. And believe me, I was pretty sick.","In football, there were drinks available everywhere you looked. On a golf tournament, you could find one free anywhere you wanted it. In tennis and NBA basketball, everybody had a hospitality suite, and so you could go there and load up if you wanted to.","I've done a lot of Super Bowls and appeared in a lot of big, big events and places and the Masters and what have you, but there was nothing as intimidating as speaking with Billy Graham.","I know I had been successful in football. I had been successful in broadcasting. I didn't think that anything could touch me. I thought, I can beat anything.","But like Mrs. Ford, I think that the more people realize what a difficult and what an insidious disease it is, the sooner people will start to correct that situation."],"Pat Summitt":["Winning is fun... Sure. But winning is not the point. Wanting to win is the point. Not giving up is the point. Never letting up is the point. Never being satisfied with what you've done is the point.","Have you ever walked along a shoreline, only to have your footprints washed away? That's what Alzheimer's is like. The waves erase the marks we leave behind, all the sand castles. Some days are better than others.","Coaching is the great passion of my life, and the job to me has always been an opportunity to work with our student athletes and help them discover what they want.","I'm not a good loser. I get sick physically... I take it to heart. I hate it.","Sometimes I'm more stubborn than I am smart.","When you learn to keep fighting in the face of potential failure, it gives you a larger skill set to do what you want to do in life. It gives you vision. But you can't acquire it if you're afraid of keeping score.","I hate to sound this way but, 'Why me? Why me with dementia?'","When you grow up on a dairy farm, cows don't take a day off. So you work every day and my dad always said, 'No one can outwork you.'","The game is never over. No matter what the scoreboard reads or what the referee says, it doesn't end when you come off the court.","Competition got me off the farm and trained me to seek out challenges and to endure setbacks; and in combination with my faith, it sustains me now in my fight with Alzheimer's disease.","I lost my confidence.","I don't want to sit around the house. I want to be out there. I want to go to practice. I want to be in the huddles. That's me.","Most people get excited about games, but I've got to be excited about practice, because that's my classroom.","In my case, symptoms began to appear when I was only 57. In fact, the doctors believe early-onset Alzheimer's has a strong genetic predictor, and that it may have been progressing for some years before I was diagnosed.","We keep score in life because it matters. It counts. It matters. Too many people opt out and never discover their own abilities because they fear failure. They don't understand commitment.","Sometimes I draw blanks.","I've got a great staff and great support system, and I'm going to stick my neck out and do what I always do.","I think I can help others just by my example.","Class is more important than a game.","I'd wake up in the morning and I would think, 'Where am I?' I'd have to gather myself.","I can remember trying to coach, trying to figure out schemes, and it just wasn't coming to me.","I think that a lot of people would perceive my style as being intimidating. And although I don't want to intimidate kids, I am very demanding.","I remember standing on a medal podium at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, imbued with a sense that if you won enough basketball games, there was no such thing as poor, backward, country, female, or inferior.","I remember teaching a clinic to other coaches, and a guy raised his hand and asked if I had any advice when it came to coaching women. I leveled him with a death-ray stare, and said, 'Go home and coach basketball.'","I was like, 'I don't know if I could be an Olympian...' But my dad really influenced me to stay and be in the Olympics."],"Pat Tiberi":["I've heard time and again from small business owners in Ohio that extending bonus depreciation is the single biggest factor in allowing their businesses to grow. Allowing companies to use these tools for capital reinvestment is a common-sense way to encourage job creation.","It's easy: if you want to grow the economy, encourage job creation, and increase federal revenue, you support making bonus depreciation permanent. Permanency gives job creators the certainty they need to plan and invest in their businesses, including hiring employees."],"Pat Toomey":["I think it's a fundamental responsibility of the federal government to enforce our nation's borders.","I think it's the broadest source of dissatisfaction amongst Republicans, out-of-control spending.","If you don't get spending under control, eventually you're going to have a big tax increase.","You can see how dysfunctional this Congress is.","I'm the guy that has written at great length about exactly how we should profoundly reform Social Security. If I were afraid of going after entitlements, I wouldn't have done that, I wouldn't have put Medicaid reform in this budget, I wouldn't have called for the reductions in spending, which people will scream about, but I think are necessary.","The toughest thing to do in politics is to do the right thing when your supporters think the right thing is something else.","If you have a federal government that's not enforcing the law and does not preserve the integrity of its own borders, then naturally, states are going to take matters into their own hands.","I tend to look at things from the supply side, looking for ways to make it less expensive to do more production. I think that's what creates a demand and keeps an economy moving.","After 2003, we lowered taxes across the board. And by 2004, revenue to the federal government grew. In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan cut taxes dramatically. And by the end of the decade, revenue coming in the federal government had doubled.","After almost 50 years in which federal spending averaged about 20 percent of GDP, Joe Sestak and Nancy Pelosi took federal spending to 25 percent. You know, that's a 25 percent increase in the size of the government overnight. That's what we - that's what we've got to rein in.","I'm the guy who's started businesses, I've been a small business owner. I've employed hundreds of Pennsylvanians. I know how to get jobs moving in the private sector, rein in the excesses in Washington, and bring some balance to a town that's lost all balance.","I have nothing but contempt for Gadhafi. I'm not a Gadhafi supporter in any way. However, it's not clear to me that it's a vital and compelling national security objective of the United States that we ought to use military force to remove him from power. He's not the only unpleasant and unsavory dictator in the world."],"Pat Travers":["I had a lousy marriage and I drank too much.","I needed an opportunity to get back in the studio and get my recording chops back together.","I'm just gonna be doing stuff that I really enjoy doing. I'm not gonna attempt to be current in any way other than the fact that people will like what I'm doing currently.","We got a little waylaid along the way. The whole problem started about 10 years ago with management and legal battles, then still trying to make albums while I was doing all of that."],"Pat Williams":["Great leaders have a heart for people. They take time for people. They view people as the bottom line, not as a tool to get to the bottom line.","We can't win at home. We can't win on the road. As general manager, I just can't figure out where else to play.","We were so bad last year, the cheerleaders stayed home and phoned in the cheers.","Coaching in the NBA is not easy. It's like a nervous breakdown with a paycheck.","I like how the other guys are stepping up. If we keep this up, then Bell does not have to score 25 points a game for us to win."],"Patanjali":["Yoga is the settling of the mind into silence. When the mind has settled, we are established in our essential nature, which is unbounded Consciousness. Our essential nature is usually overshadowed by the activity of the mind.","Ignorance is the failure to discriminate between the permanent and the impermanent, the pure and the impure, bliss and suffering, the Self and the non-Self.","Knowledge born of the finest discrimination takes us to the farthest shore. It is intuitive, omniscient, and beyond all divisions of time and space.","The cause of suffering is that the unbounded Self is overshadowed by the world."],"Patch Adams":["The role of a clown and a physician are the same - it's to elevate the possible and to relieve suffering.","At the age of 18, I made up my mind to never have another bad day in my life. I dove into a endless sea of gratitude from which I've never emerged.","You've got to know what you want. This is central to acting on your intentions. When you know what you want, you realize that all there is left then is time management. You'll manage your time to achieve your goals because you clearly know what you're trying to achieve in your life.","Clowning is a trick to get love close. I can hug 99 percent of people in the first second of contact if I'm in my clown character. The clown assumes your humanity. It assumes that, whatever trauma you've had, you can still love yourself.","Humor is an antidote to all ills.","I've never made a penny being a doctor, so that makes it not a job. My sense of a doctor is that one is a presence caring for health. So I'm never not a doctor. People call me from all over the world who are hurting, and I care for them. Chatting is what more people want than anything.","Unlike a lot of people, I don't feel powerless. I know I can do something. But anyone can do something, it's not about being special. It's about deciding to do it - to dive into work for peace and justice and care for everybody on the planet.","What I really want is a world where no one alive can remember what the word 'war' means. That's my goal.","I'm a clown, which could be a public health role. I'm really interested in moving our society away from a society needing Xanax and Prozac, and that is really feeling depressed, to one that is celebrating, and so I find just walking around in colorful clothes, people smile.","When you left the house today, you had the intention of putting clothes on and you did. You didn't try to put your pants on today. You simply put them on. The same has to hold for all of our intentions. We don't try to be more loving partners. We make the intention, and we act on it.","I'm looking for a world where love will no longer be extraordinary.","I entered medicine to use it as a vehicle for social change.","I first came to Russia because of the culture, literature and music... and my interest in the 19th-century revolutionary spirit of Herzen, Bakunin and Kropotkin. Russia is a wonderful place to bring new clowns because Russians give back a wonderful response.","Wearing underwear on the outside of your clothes can turn a tedious trip to the store for a forgotten carton of milk into an amusement park romp.","Is letting our children watch TV a form of child abuse? If our children grow up knowing everything about Britney Spears and nothing about nature or faith, about anything, is that not a form of child abuse?","Everyone who goes to a job he doesn't like is a lot weirder than I am.","If we don't change from a world society that worships money and power to one that worships compassion and generosity, I think we'll be extinct by mid-century. I don't say that as an alarmist or as a pessimist.","Robin Williams was a wonderful, kind, and generous man. One important thing I remember about his personality is that he was unassuming - he never acted as if he was powerful or famous.","We are a breathtakingly alienated people... One of my props is the world's largest underpants. I've had the president of Costa Rica in my underpants with me.","I'm great at a deathbed. I've never given tranquillisers or psychiatric medicine. I've given love and fun and creativity and passion and hope, and these things ease suffering.","I make me. At 18, I decided I wasn't going to have an unconstructed self ever. I was going to be the composer, the designer, the architect of me. It's been really fun.","I've taken clowns into the war in Bosnia, the refugee camps of Kosovo, and none of those are any more important than clowning in a subway or an elevator or just walking down the street.","While watching him work on the set of the film based on my life - Patch Adams - I saw that whenever there was a stressful moment, Robin would tap into his improvisation style to lighten the mood of cast and crew.","The medium of response in America is fame; that's how a person that bounces a ball can make millions of dollars, and a school teacher with no fame makes $35,000.","It is inexcusable that the richest country in the world does not take care of all of its people. We don't consider ourselves idealistic; we're thoughtfully trying to make a beautiful health care model."],"Patina Miller":["All my graduation money went to paying for bartending classes so I could have a side gig. I bartended for two months before I was supposed to move to New York and then two months later I got the job as an understudy in 'Sister Act' and haven't looked back since.","I've always wanted a Maltese-poodle, but I've always been really busy. So I said once I'm back in the city and the 'Sister Act' stuff dies down, I'm going to get a puppy.","I live alone, so I don't really talk to anyone once I'm home. I have some silent nights.","It was always my dream, to do a leading role on Broadway. It's what I went to college to do, in hopes of one day someone taking a chance on me and saying, 'You know what? You're going to be our girl.'","I got into hula hooping at age six - I hula hooped all day, every day. That was something I was comfortable with, but I never tried walking or singing while hula hooping! It's actually pretty difficult and tiring. But I like challenging myself. It's hard, but it's really fun.","That's been the most exciting part of the show - incorporating the magic and the acrobats and the singing and dancing to make our 'Pippin.'","I've been doing lots of trapeze, and so much of it is holding your own weight.","When I started performing in public, I was probably around 10 or 11.","I went to Carnegie Mellon.","Oh, my mom. She's one of my biggest fans.","'Sister Act' was my first audition out of school. I was 21 and cast as the understudy. It was non-Equity, so I lived in L.A. on $300 a week. I did that for a month and then came to New York to do a couple of gigs, including 'Hair' in the park, before going to London with 'Sister Act,' where I played the lead.","I always tell friends you can't judge your success by someone else's. You can't be afraid to fail."],"Patrice Leconte":["Married people from my generation are like an endangered species!","I am not a fan of westerns particularly.","I like cinema. I am very fond of it. But from time to time I feel like having some time on my own.","Yes, I am very prolific.","I'm not one to dwell on rehearsal or preparation.","I like films to be complete in their written form.","When I was young, my idea was to become a filmmaker.","I would rather my films be well-known than I be well-known.","I can zero in on subtle things because I'm holding the camera.","You may think it's very presumptuous, but I really hope that my movies are going to turn people into better people.","You can work, shop, do everything from home, and I find this unsettling.","I never storyboard. I hate it. I don't understand why so many directors want to make comic strips of their films.","Working with the same people is so much quicker and frees up your energy for other things.","Working with a bunch of actors is like trying to tune each violin.","What I expect of a movie reviewer is that he should love cinema as much as I do.","My movies are, more or less, very short. I'm terrified of boring an audience.","I like films that are well-written and concise and with not a lot of room for improvisation.","If a film is very clever and well-written, that's what gives you freedom as a director.","But I won't work with the exact same crew film after film because I feel the work would get a little complacent.","No, but it's not because I'm getting older that I'm trying to accelerate. But something very curious is happening: The older I get, the more ideas I'm getting.","I've always done 20 things at once. It's my way of staying alive, not to keep one dish cooking, but several dishes going. And I'm pretty organized."],"Patrice Motsepe":["Education is at the heart of achieving your dreams.","If we continue doing the right things in Africa, we can create a very exciting and competitive global market here.","South Africans are caring, compassionate and loving people.","I have confidence in mining. I see exciting opportunities in it.","Only in South Africa could you have a change in government without civil war. If there wasn't the depth of love and caring among our people, this would not have happened.","My comrades would call me a 'black capitalist.'","The relationship between ARMgold and Harmony continues to develop and grow.","Abe Krok was a man of integrity who made a unique contribution to Mamelodi Sundowns and to South African football.","You have to have a globally competitive mining dispensation.","I've heard people say South Africans are arrogant, that they act no differently from their colonial masters. That needs to change. It's in your business interest as an entrepreneur to form meaningful partnerships. That's how you do well for your shareholders.","Youth all over the world are very hungry to succeed.","The system of creating opportunities for those who were by law excluded, you've got to do that. But you mustn't create a perception that the process is devoid of competitiveness... devoid of building a world class, sustainable black business community.","People don't know that there were very successful black businessmen in the years of apartheid.","You could be worth $2 billion today and a half a billion tomorrow. It doesn't take much for this to disappear overnight."],"Patrice O'Neal":["People have tried to corner the market on being offended, corner the market on language and corner the market on opinion. Should I lose my job 'cause I offended somebody? No, of course not. Your life should never be affected by public opinion.","I like to be loved or hated - I don't like mediocre. So I'd rather have the entire crowd hate me than to have 90% hate me.","I'm a decent cook, and I will try to cook anything. My only weakness is that I don't know servings - I only know how to make a lot.","I'm a slave to the culture, so I see an Audi, a Denali, or an Escalade, my neighbor got the four-door Porsche. I have a really nice truck. But it's a Durango and I like frontin'! I like to ride by and show off.","I don't go to any sexy places to eat where they give you half a lamb chop and one bean. I like going, 'Uhhh, I'm done' when I eat.","Not everybody should be laughing at everything at the same time. That's not even natural. My thing is to feel natural, because I don't want to feel like I could just make people laugh at every single joke, every single time, with the same decibel level.","I've still got that little freedom part of me that wants to have a car that looks really sexy.","I am that guy who will say things that people seem to think is a little edgy, a little racy.","I need a little bass and I don't even need that crazy bass to break your face. I just want it to sound good when I have my favorite song.","I'm a big buffet dude, or I'm a big cheap-food-and-order-more-when-I-need-it dude.","I'm a thigh-meat dude. Thigh is just the best meat - I don't get chicken breast. I think it's a publicity stunt that we've convinced people it's delicious.","Just making the crowd laugh is not really doing things for me anymore. That's just knowing how to kill; I've learned how to kill - but also learned when a crowd's laughter is meaningful.","Who has connections to Connecticut? That's where rich people go to live the rest of their life in the woods.","The case is I talk for a living, so I should be able to say anything I want to say regardless of how you feel. What we're starting to deal with now is your opinion matters, but to be quite honest, your opinion means nothing."],"Patricia A. Woertz":["My mother felt we'd be earning a living during our entire adult lives, and therefore believed we should spend summers in learning activities. Consequently, I got to see a plate glass factory in Pittsburgh, a U.S. Steel plant, and how Heinz made ketchup.","There is not a job I've held in my career that was held by a woman before me.","I'm sometimes mistaken as the wife of the chairman. I just laugh it off.","Mom worked as a school librarian, and she felt summers were for education.","I've always enjoyed seeing how things are made.","I learned about M&A and how to value assets and work with investment bankers.","It's clear there is an energy positive in producing ethanol."],"Patricia Arquette":["I grew up in a hippie commune so I have a real hippie part of me.","Hippy people had a hopeful idea of what they wanted the world to be like, then most of them changed into corporate Yuppies. But I still have that hippy thing underneath somewhere.","We all have our own little thing, I think.","I don't have a goal but I just want to work on movies that I really like.","I liked the premise of this material. I love the marriage relationship. They kind of keep each other honest, and they enjoy each other's sense of humor. Kind of a sexy but boring relationship.","Neither of us entered marriage thinking it wouldn't be a strain. Life has strains in it, and he's the person I want to strain with.","I find that men are far more vain than women.","You want your partner to objectify you.","I don't read my reviews, but I have a bunch of them and I will when I'm 80."],"Patricia Birch":["I found I loved musicals as much or more than the pure dance world. I also think I became tired of dancing for other dancers.","I had always choreographed a little, beginning in high school. And I leaned toward choreography. I always had an overview of what was going on.","What I really like doing is storytelling, finding the body language that is necessary for the story. And when I'm doing it and it's working, I'm thrilled.","The goal is to divide my time between stage and film."],"Patricia Briggs":["I've been a storyteller all my life. When I was in high school, I used to amuse myself by driving through the woods at night and see how long it would be before I scared the pants off my friends - and if I could do it before I scared myself.","For the traditional fantasies, a lot more of my research comes from reading rather than doing. I like my worlds to feel real, so I do a lot of world building research.","Read good books. Read bad books - and figure out why you don't like them. Then don't do it when you write. If you are a science fiction or fantasy writer, going to conventions and attending panels is very useful.","The conflict between the creatures of Native Lore and the immigration of the European preternatural hosts is hinted at in 'Blood Bound' and reflects the conflicts between the human immigrants and the Indian people who were already here.","When I put magic into a book - whether it's a wizard or a crusty old werewolf - I'm asking a reader to swallow a huge leap that is counter to everything he or she knows. An extra big helping of reality makes that leap go down a lot easier.","The cool thing about writing is that there is really never a typical day. Sometimes I get a rhythm going and head off to work every morning and come home at night. Sometimes I'll write for two days straight and then be utterly blank for the next two.","When I write, I get glimpses into future novels.","My mother was a children's librarian. I remember when traditional stories were revised for modern audiences until they bore only a nodding acquaintance with the originals, but were released as 'authentic Indian stories' when they were, in fact, nothing of the kind.","I am not attempting to preserve culture, or record actual events or stories. Instead I bow my head in gratitude to those storytellers who have gone before and paved a way for me play in their stomping grounds. Doubtless those who want to be offended, will - allowing me to make them happy, too, which pleases me as much as it pleases them."],"Patricia Clarkson":["The odds of having films made which star women... Everyone still references one movie: 'Bridesmaids!'","And now oddly I'm getting sexier parts than I've ever gotten.","Being married and having a child was not something I wanted, and I knew that at a very young age. I tend to be more solitary, and I'm truly a free spirit.","New Orleans. Born and raised. I lived there until I was 19.","Well did graduate summa cum laude from Fordham University.","I'll read a script maybe twice, but I'll think about the role more than I'll rehearse lines.","I don't like a lot of rehearsing.","The majority of work I do is in independent films, where you're lucky if you have five takes.","But I have had the luxury of working on good films with great people.","I think it would be hard to go the distance in this business without a sense of humor.","Why are comedic parts for women the exception, not the rule?","See, the SAG awards caught me totally by surprise.","The odds are not in your favor the older you get, especially if you're a woman in this business.","But no, had I been successful in my 20s I would have been just fine. But it is nice to defy the odds.","Holly Hunter has been doing great work forever.","I have to watch the news or my day is not complete.","I'm obsessed. I've always needed to know what's going on but now it's a must.","I love writers. All of my best friends are writers.","I just have a thing for writers. Maybe it because I'm just so not a writer.","I'm really a director's actor. I rely heavily on a director.","I always try to approach character first and foremost viscerally.","It's never easy with characters in these dark and grave circumstances but that's my job.","I think it's always harder in a film to convey intimacy.","You're always close and you never get that big romantic lead.","I think it kind of took being a character actor to kind of now enter into leading ladies.","I'm still traumatized that I'm going to be on a big screen in a white bikini and naked so who knows!","And I have a really great agent and I know it's almost an oxymoron to say you have a smart agent. But she is and she has a beautiful aesthetic and she has guided me.","If my gravy train stops at SAG, honey, it's been a great ride.","These archetypal older women in movies can sometimes make my skin crawl. It's about the one dimension; it's about the lack of any texture.","When I was younger, of course I had people act inappropriately to me. I've had certain directors yell at me. But I didn't stand for it, and I didn't let it go far enough for it to be in any way abusive to me.","There are still so many movies made starring 50 men and one woman! A white male actor should never be allowed to complain about anything. Shut up and sit in the corner. I mean, seriously!","Parts that are desexed, matronly - to just put me in a couple of scenes and have me be the older, you know, dead character, is not gonna fly with me."],"Patricia Cornwell":["Survival was my only hope, success my only revenge.","I believe the root of all evil is abuse of power.","I didn't invent forensic science and medicine. I just was one of the first people to recognize how interesting it is.","First of all, it does not deter crime, the death penalty.","Being with someone who is smart and gives good advice adds tremendously wonderful elements to your life.","The greatest gift is our own eyes, sense of smell, and abilities to deduce.","If everybody, every day, would try to do one thing that pulls them beyond themselves the world will start being a better place.","Even when I am writing I usually take a break around lunchtime and go for a little walk to clear out my head.","Everyone is doing forensics.","In the first person, the readers feel smart, like it's them solving the case.","I refuse to sit on my laurels.","I like crazy shoes or unusual cowboy boots and I collect big belt buckles.","If it's really beautiful weather, sometimes I might take a helicopter out. I got my license in 1999.","On the last morning of Virginia's bloodiest year since the Civil War, I built a fire and sat facing a window of darkness where at sunrise I knew I would find the sea.","I am an Armani and a Dolce & Gabbana kind of a person.","Night fell clean and cold in Dublin, and wind moaned beyond my room as if a million pipes played the air.","Even if you are a best-seller you feel insecure because it is all so unpredictable.","I'm always surprised when large numbers of people buy my books.","I wouldn't want to donate my body for scientific study.","I find it difficult to attend autopsies. Especially the smells.","I've always believed human blood is red because it really needs to draw attention to itself.","I've never taken a scalpel to a dead body.","I dropped chemistry. I practically blew up the lab in college.","The biggest risk with a series that goes on this long is that you'll get bored with the character.","But when I was a little kid, I was always writing stories and illustrating little books that I would create.","That's why I think the 'Scarpetta' series has worked so well because people like spending time with this character.","I am a journalist.","I'm very, very sensitive to pain and to people who suffer.","My friends call me Miss Worst Case Scenario.","I've had people turn up to book signings with knives, with guns.","I've been stalked.","Obviously people read the books in order to be entertained.","If you chomp down too hard on my work, you're going to break your teeth.","I won't put myself in a position where I'm vulnerable.","When I was in second grade, my mother moved from Miami to this evangelical conservative environment in western North Carolina, two miles down the road from Billy Graham and his wife, Ruth.","I don't do things that are illegal.","In my forties, my optimism was boundless. I had really good health and tremendous success which allowed me to do anything I wanted.","My fans want me to talk to them. And even if they want to be critical, I want to hear what they've got to say.","Murder is about power and the more powerful women get the more it will change the good that they do and the bad that they do.","The human capacity to be curious has always existed.","With DNA, the ability to find out a lot more with a lot less has increased our ability for identification.","I constantly remind people that crime isn't solved by technology; it's solved by people.","I am a fan of Botox.","Botox not only helps with wrinkles, it actually makes you feel more relaxed as frowning causes tension.","I stop working at about 3 p.m. on Fridays.","I like to get to bed with a clear head."],"Patricia Heaton":["Anytime anybody is rude, it makes me double-check my own behavior to make sure I don't do that to other people.","Christians - whether as a priest, a nun, a minister, whatever - have just been stereotyped to death. You try to be a model of kindness and love and forgiveness to all those around you, because you have received kindness and love and forgiveness from God through Christ. That's what Christianity is.","I'm always dissing Ray and making fun of him, talking about his money.","I have always believed that when you're feeling sorry for yourself, the best thing to do is help someone else.","I don't remember my mother ever playing with me. And she was a perfectly good mother. But she had to do the laundry and clean the house and do the grocery shopping.","Plastic surgery is like a big elephant sitting in the Hollywood living room.","I think there's a difference when you make fun of yourself and your own behavior, and when you dishonor or disrespect Christ. If you're making a mockery of Christ is one thing. But if you're just joking about human foibles and weaknesses, I think that's perfectly acceptable.","Men are very competent in their workplace - and this is going to sound sexist - women are better at running households and juggling lots of things, kids and scheduling and that kind of thing.","Boys wear their hearts on their sleeves. Even when they're trying to pull one over on you they're so transparent. Like men.","I just don't know a couple that's been married more than three years that doesn't annoy the heck out of each other every 15 minutes.","My favorite body part? My feet. They're not pretty, but they get me where I want to go.","But I think boys ultimately are easier than girls.","Before we had the kids, my husband and I were traveling a lot and working and really enjoying our lives and each other. We both love the theater and books and travel and so we were really having a lot of fun.","We did an episode where she goes out to get a job and she gets fired because she's not good. They hire a babysitter to help out and she finds out she hates the fact that the kids have more fun with the sitter than her.","Home life is a foreign environment for most guys. So it's natural to show them being idiots at home.","Most of my friends from college became dental hygienists or went into retail, a lot went into sales. They all started getting married and having kids and buying homes and I was still living like a college student.","I just have always felt that I think we know that it's an ensemble show, and it's very hard to pick a show to submit when you're nominated, because usually everyone has a very strong part in every episode.","This is the other thing: we make the cost of raising kids higher than it has to be just because we feel they need all this stuff, like gadgets, certain schools, and activities that are nice but aren't really necessary.","I'm sort of a slob.","I was raised Catholic and I'm Presbyterian now, but I've always been a Christian, regardless of denomination. I believe that Jesus is the way.","I've learned to look like I'm listening to long confusing plots of cartoons and comic books when I'm actually sound asleep or making grocery shopping lists in my head.","I spend as much time with my kids as any mom who stays home. I only work during the hours they're at school, but there is always the sense of trying to catch up with all their stuff and not only organize my work life but also their school lives.","I think Raymond is very honest about human relationships.","I've always been an independent person, but that independence was in the setting of security.","I felt totally released from the need to make it as an actress. I had experienced complete fulfillment in something that had nothing to do with me being in the spotlight.","I have to keep reminding myself: If you give your life to God, he doesn't promise you happiness and that everything will go well. But he does promise you peace. You can have peace and joy, even in bad circumstances.","It's hard enough to work and raise a family when your kids are all healthy and relatively normal, but when you add on some kind of disability or disease, it can just be such a burden.","Some people are cool with the fact that their bodies bear witness to this great thing they produced, their children, and I understand that. But on a personal level, it makes me feel better that my breasts are not down to my knees when I'm undressed in front of my husband.","I'm not good at accepting help.","When it comes to accepting emotional support or affection, I'm a little guarded and hardened to that.","My mother-in-law was with me during all four of my births and when she was sitting next to me holding my hand during the cesareans, well, I craved that.","I was not an easy kid.","You see people all the time who are on hit shows and then you never hear from them again.","Again, I find it difficult to be taken care of and rarely acknowledge it, and every act he does registers, but I also just need to verbally acknowledge him and hug him.","And I find it very easy to memorize the scripts, which are so close to conversations my husband and I have.","It's a little bit in the genes because my brother is a journalist and my father was a sports writer.","And I started as a journalism major at Ohio State, ended up in theater and I love to read.","You kind of think people get sick of you after a while, but apparently not.","And I think I have a perspective about Hollywood that you don't see very often in the press.","We only work four days a week, we only work three weeks out of the month, and we get four months off for the summer. So there's plenty of time for me to spend with the kids.","I know the situations that we do every week are all ones that I encounter in my life or will encounter.","A woman experiencing an unplanned pregnancy also deserves to experience unplanned joy.","God will open any doors he wants to open, and if He closes doors, that's fine, too.","I've found that people feel very free to say insulting things, not about me personally, but about the things I believe. It's sad, because I really could care less where people are coming from, politically, religiously.","What I found in the Protestant faith was that your salvation is secure, and that the rest is process.","I've always felt a spiritual connection with acting. And I felt whole when I was onstage.","I always know I'm going to lose my job. It's either going to be canceled next week or next year or nine years from now, but I always know my job is going to go.","There's enough hard stuff going on in people's lives, and you really need that joy that laughter can bring. I don't have to put that in a Christian compartment.","My husband is always telling me I need to do less, do less, do less. But I feel like if I'm not being productive, I have a hard time relaxing and enjoying myself.","Frankly, most of my friends hold very different political beliefs. It's just a funny thing in this country that supposedly you can't sit down and have dinner and enjoy another person's company if you don't have the same beliefs. It's ridiculous.","From the beginning of church history, music, writing, literature, and the greatest works of art all came from the church. To change the culture and make it a force for good, you have to be in it and be a part of it.","As a child, I would put on shows in my neighborhood with friends and perform Barbra Streisand songs for my classmates."],"Patricia Hewitt":["The accusation that we've lost our soul resonates with a very modern concern about authenticity.","The 2 million people who work in the NHS and social care are also themselves patients and users. I know they all want to treat patients and users the way they and their families would want to be treated and that is the purpose of our reforms.","People are not perfect... very often the relationships that are strongest are those where people have worked through big crises, but they've had to work through them. So the challenge to us is to work through that.","I think he was absolutely right not to go to UN last week... First things first - that is, values and people here in their local communities, and remembering all politics is local, and trusting people more.","I have very real concerns about the civil liberties implications of ultimately requiring every resident to submit themselves for compulsory fingerprinting or some other biometric test.","We're seeing quite a lot of people who really would like a return to class-based politics.","We just have to be crystal clear that if we were to abandon all the reforms made over some very painful years in the Labour party, we would be consigned back to opposition.","You don't repair that relationship by sitting down and talking about trust or making promises. Actually, what rebuilds it is living it and doing things differently - and I think that is what is going to make the difference.","Certainly we know from our own experience how very difficult it is when you've lost an election that perhaps a lot of people were expecting you to win.","So there clearly is a sense in which the Labour Party here, certainly at State level is reaching out and connecting with people and reflecting the aspirations and needs of, you know the mass of ordinary Australians.","And it seems to me in that experience may lie at least some of the clues for policy development perhaps constitutional changes as well that Labour will need to make at the national level too.","Well I think all I would say on that is, when we were in opposition in Britain and Hawke and then Keating were in power here, Labor was in power here, we learnt a huge amount from the ALP's experience here.","And some of what we're doing in Government even now, some of the welfare reform programs that are helping lone mothers come into work are based on things that were very new under the Labour Government in the eighties.","And I hope very much that the ALP will become increasingly engaged in the international discussions that are taking place amongst centre-left parties generally.","But clearly at the same time you've got to get out there and connect with voters and actually respond to the needs, the frustrations, whatever problems their now saying are not being adequately solved.","You've got to respond to that and of course thinking through the role of a left party in the modern world, in the modern economy and society and having a policy response to that.","But getting your party structure right may also be a precondition for getting your policies right.","As patients and consumers, we are better informed today about our health care than any previous generation.","A modern health and social care system has to be completely focussed on the needs of its users.","Barbara Castle should have been Labour's - and Britain's - first female prime minister. What a role model she would have been: passionate, fiery, and absolutely committed to social justice.","Barbara Castle was a hero to millions of British women. She inspired a new generation of women to become active in Labour politics, including, of course Labour's deputy leader, Harriet Harman."],"Patricia Highsmith":["I only know it takes weeks to recover, as if one had been in a car accident.","My imagination functions much better when I don't have to speak to people.","I find the public passion for justice quite boring and artificial.","I don't think Ripley is gay. He appreciates good looks in other men, that's true. But he's married in later books. I'm not saying he's very strong in the sex department. But he makes it in bed with his wife.","For neither life nor nature cares if justice is ever done or not.","I think J.D. Salinger is correct in granting no interviews, and in making no speeches.","I prefer to live in the country where it's quiet. Woody Allen movies there are dubbed into Italian.","I can't write if someone else is in the house, not even the cleaning woman.","I like to work for four or five hours a day. I aim for seven days a week.","I have no television - I hate it.","I don't set the alarm to get up. I get up when I feel like it.","A few years ago, there were requests to me, Can we make this? I said that I have no rights. Contact the Hitchcock estate, which won't release it for a remake.","That wasn't a bad price for a first book. My agent upped it as much as possible. I was 27 and had nothing behind me. I was working like a fool to earn a living and pay for my apartment.","I didn't hang around films. I don't know if I'd ever seen Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes.","Robert Walker as Bruno was excellent. He had elegance and humor, and the proper fondness for his mother.","I was in New York. Hitchcock was in California. He rang me to make a report on his progress and said, I'm having trouble. I've just sacked my second screenwriter.","I have Graham Greene's telephone number, but I wouldn't dream of using it. I don't seek out writers because we all want to be alone.","I hope it will be set in California. In a way, I made a mistake, because a New Jersey policeman can't operate that way in New York. But in California, he can move between different counties.","Ripley is married. And he's not lost. He has his feet on the ground.","If people have bought something of mine, they know by now that I will decline writing it for the movies.","I don't want to know movie directors. I don't want to be close to them. I don't want to interfere with their work. I don't want them to interfere with mine.","I hated cracking the whip, and these juries turn into political things.","Some fellow from the Third World kept hammering for prizes for a Communist film which was rotten."],"Patricia Hill Collins":["Most activism is brought about by us ordinary people.","Work for black women has been an important and valued dimension of Afrocentric definitions of black motherhood.","Women gain social influence through their roles as mothers, transmitters of culture, and parents for the next generation.","The role model approach to social change is no substitute for challenging unjust employment practices, educational policies and housing.","Social conditions that spur large numbers of people into action are ignored in favor of a Hollywood version of history focusing on one conquering hero. Since a movement for social change is embodied in its leader, death of the leader means death of the movement.","Black women's feelings of responsibility for nurturing the children in their own extended family networks have stimulated a more generalized ethic of care where black women feel accountable to all the black community's children.","Far too many black men who praise their own mother feel less accounted to the mothers of their own children."],"Patricia Ireland":["When I hear traditional family values raised, I hear that effort once again to re-establish the man as head and master of his family. Who had the, not only the right, but the obligation to discipline his wife and children to keep them in line?","We may be in a tough time right now, but when we are in a tough time is when our movement gets really strong.","The opposition has moved from a blaming the victim to blaming the victim's advocate's statistics. Irrespective of what the numbers are, it's far too many.","Stewardesses are still paid so little that in many cases, new hires qualify for food stamps.","Some campaigns are not worth waging if you can't win; others have to be fought on grounds of principle regardless of the chances for success.","We have to stop this violence. We have to make the political nature of the violence clear, that the violence we experience in our own homes is not a personal family matter, it's a public and political problem. It's a way that women are kept in line, kept in our places.","We always knew when we took on the issue of violence against women that somehow our opposition would come after us.","I've talked to law enforcement officials at the state and local level who say that violence against women is going up. In any case, we think that it's an important issue whether it's going up or not. And we are determined to stop it.","The way to be a man if you're a little boy is to be willing to throw your weight around.","When I started law school I was shocked to learn that our legal system traditionally had the man as the head and master of the family. As late as the '70s and '80s when we were fighting for the Equal Rights Amendment, states like Louisiana still had a head and master law.","And of course we are familiar with the English common law rule of thumb that said a man could in fact use a stick no bigger than his thumb to discipline his wife and family.","The Violence Against Women Act is so important. It provides money to train the cop on the beat, to train the judges that this is a new day, that we won't tolerate this violence and to know how to deal with it.","Some of us may just, in one-on-one conversations with our family, with our friends, over the back fence with our neighbors, talk about the reality of our lives and realize that we're not alone, that we have a right to be physically safe and emotionally safe in our own homes.","I know that it isn't just violence against women, it's how do we support ourselves and our families, how do we deal with health care for ourselves and our families? It's a bigger picture.","Violence may be a good focus to organize around, but we have to look at women's lives in our entirety.","Some of those men in power, we just have to change their faces because we're not going to change their minds.","I want to organize so that women see ourselves as people who are entitled to power, entitled to leadership.","Jesus never said anything about homosexuality.","My answer to those who oppose my appointment as CEO is that this is really a decision of the YWCA. They want to strengthen their grassroots to advocate on behalf of women's and children's empowerment and ending racism.","I come from a Christian faith. I am not going to give you insight into my particular beliefs.","The Young Women's Christian Association is nourished by its roots in Christianity and, at the same time, over the years, it's been enriched by beliefs and values from all kinds of places, even, in fact, strengthened by our diversity.","I want to reach young women and to get them involved in the mission of the YWCA, economic empowerment of women and girls, and ending racism.","I have a very personal interest. I am a Miami-Dade voter. One of the issues is that my vote and so many other votes of women and African Americans in Florida are being discounted or discarded. I want my vote to count.","More than 10,000 ballots in Miami-Dade County have been rejected by some machine without any opportunity for a human being to take a look. That is just not right.","Bush's choice of Dick Cheney as his running mate is clear confirmation of the policies he would promote and the nominations he would make to an already closely divided U.S. Supreme Court.","They plan to ride into the White House on the Sweet Talk Express. Well, think again. Bush and Cheney are not compassionate conservatives. They are ruthless reactionaries.","Extremely strong, effective, tenacious, and powerful political networks can be built when you fight losing battles as well as when you win.","In any grass-roots campaign, building an ongoing base of support is as important as winning the ultimate goal.","Women are called upon to defend every bit of progress we have made against particularly virulent attack. But we must also hold out a vision, put forth a positive agenda of what women need and want and then move forward toward that dream.","I know that Bush, for political reasons, is going to nominate a minority, a Hispanic man or someone where it will be harder for people on the progressive side to oppose and split some of the traditionally progressive or democratic constituents.","Advice and consent does not mean rubber stamp in the Senate.","Most of us see Justice O'Connor as something of an icon, although we do not agree with all of her decisions.","There are a lot of people who worked extremely hard in the election who are still organized who know how to do door to door and phone canvassing, who know how to raise money.","I just have that sense this is the reason we got Sandra Day O'Connor on the Court in the first place is because Ronald Reagan was running for President.","I don't think you lead by pessimism and cynicism. I think you lead by optimism and enthusiasm and energy."],"Patricia Kaas":["Sometimes, I wake up and the skies are grey and everything's horrible.","People tried to make me something that I wasn't at the beginning of my career.","When you lose your mother at 20 and then your father soon after, melancholia is part of your life.","I always doubted myself. I doubted the way I looked, my body, my voice - everything.","I am not sad, but I am melancholic. When you lose your mother at 20 and then your father soon after, melancholia is part of your life.","When you are 25 or even 30, you can just do things. When you get to 35, things are different. Time is more precious to me now. I've got my priorities."],"Patricia MacLachlan":["I have great editors, and I always have. Somehow, great editors ask the right questions or pose things to you that get you to write better. It's a dance between you, your characters, and your editor.","My inspiration for writing is all the wonderful books that I read as a child and that I still read. I think that for those of us who write, when we find a wonderful book written by someone else, we don't really get jealous, we get inspired, and that's kind of the mark of what a good writer is.","I think what happens is you write how you grew up. And I was born on the prairie, and so everything is kind of spare on the prairie. And so I'm just used to writing in that way. 'Sarah, Plain and Tall' was that way. And most of my fiction is. I like writing small pieces. Somehow it just suits me.","I think it's important to remember where I began. I know that when I talk to other writers, say, writers from the South or writers from abroad, it's where they begin as children that is important to them.","I have great respect for children. And I have great respect for their ability as writers.","Each time I write a new piece, whether a novel, a picture book, a speech or anything, really, it has so much to do with what I'm going through personally or a problem I'm trying to work out. When I wrote my novel 'Baby,' my three children had all just gone out the door.","Being married to a psychologist, I realize that I learn more from imperfections.","I'm working on a bunch of things with my daughter Emily. In some ways, she's a smarter and better editor than I am.","I can always tell when I'm about to start writing. I go through cycles in reading. When I'm beginning to start to write something, I start reading what I think of as good literature. I read things with wonderful language.","I never work from an outline, and often I don't know how the story will end.","In a way, my childhood was one long bunch of pages... I read and read and read.","Looking back, I see that I write books about brothers and sisters, about what makes up a family, what works and what is nurturing.","I love to talk to children about making mistakes. It's important that I tell them about how I don't get it right the first time. We live in such a perfectionist society, and they see so many finished products and polished performances.","I have to write what I can write, and writing the text of a picture book is like walking a tightrope, if you ramble off... As my friend Julius Lester says, 'A picture book is the essence of an experience.'","My mother, as a girl, had remembered this woman from Maine, someone who was part of the extended family somehow, and I recall her talking about this great, risk-taking woman. There are the most amazing, heroic stories in everybody's lives."],"Patricia Marx":["New York may be the city that never sleeps, but Shanghai doesn't even sit down, and not just because there is no room.","One false word, one extra word, and somebody's thinking about how they have to buy paper towels at the store. Brevity is very important. If you're going to be longwinded, it should be for a purpose. Not just because you like your words.","Perhaps the most mysterious of all mammals is the male Homo sapiens. Indeed, many anthropologists classify the group as a subspecies.","Being serious just makes me a little bit embarrassed.","I write the shopping column. I think I've proven my superficiality.","I'm a goody-goody. I'm the person who sits in the back row, makes fun of the teacher, and secretly does the extra-credit work.","For somebody who is a journalist, I can be awfully unobservant sometimes.","Everyone thinks that 'Chinatown' is the best screenplay. I'm not sure it is.","Unless you're a salesman, or a bad guest on a talk show, you don't call someone by his name that often.","I think I began to like writing a lot more, and to be a better writer, when I did it for a while alone. It made me a little more confident about my style.","I don't really care that much about eating. But I like impressing people with how good a cook I am. So I will cook. I'm an excellent cook. Not many people know that about me.","I do not find the concept of consorting with unknown persons appealing.","'Couch surfing' refers to the practice of temporarily lodging with a stranger - free of charge, unless you count being incessantly sociable as payment.","New York is rich in culture, cuisine, and commerce.","It's better to spend a lot on a getup you love than a fraction of that on something, or even five of those somethings, that you'll never bother to take out of the shopping bag. By the way, this advice also applies to discount love interests. And half-price sushi.","High heels weren't always a girl thing. In the fifteen-hundreds, the riding shoes of French noblemen were fitted with raised heels so that their feet stayed put in the stirrups. Over the next few decades, heels inched higher on dress shoes, particularly among men of privilege.","The Chinese are no slouches when it comes to capitalism.","You don't have to spend much time in Shanghai before you start to get all existential about the meaning of authenticity. Did you know that Shanghai is building nine satellite towns, each designed to mimic the architecture and culture of a different country?","Though the male can be noble in reason and infinite in faculties, he is also easily amused by shiny toys, especially ones that do dumb things on his desk.","Males have probably always enjoyed watching the defeat of other males, but without the invention of numerals and the subsequent invention of the concept of keeping score, we could never have had a million sports channels.","Men still wear cologne, but I wish they wouldn't. No matter what you may believe, all men's fragrances smell like the air freshener in a taxi."],"Patricia McBride":["I remember my dreams when I was a junior soloist. 'Oh, I hope I don't end here,' I thought. 'I want to do the ballerina in 'Scotch Symphony.' I don't want to be the little Scotch girl.' And I actually went beyond my wildest dreams. I worked with Balanchine. I had ballets choreographed for me.","When I hung up my toe shoes, I didn't look back. In all my years, I have never looked back.","I've had an extraordinary life as a dancer. You tour the world, you see all the great capitals of the world, the beautiful old opera houses all over Europe - you go everywhere. As a teenager, I would always say, 'I can't believe this is happening to little me,' because it was always a dream to dance.","I am just so thankful that my mom was a fantastic mom. She wasn't a stage mother; she didn't push me. She was happy if I was happy. We are so different. I was very shy; my mom did all the talking. She was my strength. She never expected that I would be this ballerina.","My daughter arrived when I was five months pregnant with my son. We adopted Melanie from Korea; she was 2 years old, almost 3. I always wanted to have a family. I had a good example because Melissa Hayden was a ballerina in our company, and she had two children and danced afterward, and Allegra Kent also did.","When you dance, it takes a lot of stamina, but it never seemed like work 'cause I was doing something that I so loved doing. It was always a joy. And you know, to have beautiful ballets made specially for you is such an honor. I always said it was better than diamonds.","It was extraordinary 'cause I was 17 years old when I first danced with Edward Villella. And we were both young. But I had seen him dance, and he was already a star. So he was just so gentle and wonderful and kind, and we had a great rapport together. He was one of the most exciting dancers of our day.","Conrad Ludlow was an extraordinary partner... We just called him the greatest partner because he just knew what a woman's balance was.","I have such respect for... the Kennedy Center Honors. To be an artist in America and to be honored for it is extraordinary. In Europe, they really honor their artists. And you are on a very high level. And here it's not as revered as it is in Europe or Russia or anywhere in the world.","I cherish the ballets made for myself by Mr. Balanchine. He never lost his temper. He was quiet, humble, the genius of the 20th century.","In the beginning, he taught you how to hold your fingers, use your head, hold your shoulders, how you glissade, bourre - the exact way he wanted you to do the steps. It was relearning the whole Balanchine technique.","Mr. Balanchine wanted me to be myself. He didn't want me to look like anyone else. I love teaching our company dancers the Balanchine ballets. I try to give them what was passed down to me and what I learned from him. They dance it so beautifully. It also keeps me close to Mr. Balanchine. He's with me every single day.","Breathe through your movements.","I always had an inferiority complex, like I wasn't good enough. I was shy. But dancing gave me so much joy, and I was good at it. I felt like a whole person because I could dance.","I felt that Balanchine was my father towards me. He was the person I most admired and looked up to.","I was determined to dance. That's why I lasted so long.","Most ballets are more interesting than most men.","I used to say I didn't want to teach. I was still excited about dancing. It's hard to do both. It's as exhausting teaching as it is to dance.","I want to be happy, to look back and feel I danced well at the end of my career and didn't dwindle off. It would be too sad.","I danced with Jacques d'Amboise. At that time, he was the tallest man in the company. So it was a different kind of choreography. It was lyrical.","The ballets you do make you into the final product you are. And I had extraordinary partners.","In Europe, a great dancer might be on the same level as a movie star. In America, not so.","It was a pleasure to meet President Obama and Michelle. I'm not a political person, but I admire what he has done.","Mr. Balanchine was a great gentleman, and he loved his dancers. He was devoted to his company. He came to the ballet every night, and his presence was felt. It was like the whole company was dancing for him. And if he liked you, he trusted you to be yourself. He didn't try to change you and make you into something you were not.","When you're a star, critics can't make or break you."],"Patricia McCormick":["I don't want to go slumming in somebody else's pain just to write a book. I want to go into those darker places to shine a light on that experience and come out with a story that validates the human spirit.","The power of storytelling is to free us from isolation, shame, and whatever the situation.","My son jokes with me that he thinks I Google the word 'sad' to come up with book ideas.","I think young adults get a bad rap for being self-absorbed and self-centered. My experience going around the United States and speaking in schools is that teenagers here are very interested in the fate of their peers around the world."],"Patricia Meyer Spacks":["Gossip, even when it avoids the sexual, bears around it a faint flavor of the erotic.","The vanity of men, a constant insult to women, is also the ground for the implicit feminine claim of superior sensitivity and morality."],"Patricia Millett":["While I have the greatest respect for the Supreme Court's members, I cannot claim familiarity with any particular judicial philosophies the justices might possess.","I try to do two moot courts for every Supreme Court case (and one to two for courts of appeals), and to ensure I am being mooted by people who know the Supreme Court well and are coming to the case fresh.","I do not need any cheerleaders at my moot court. And I cannot imagine walking into that Court without the preparation of a few vicious moot courts; it is critical to the development of my thinking.","I certainly have a pretty settled pattern at this point of what I do substantively in terms of reviewing briefs, record materials, cases, etc.","I do try very hard to develop themes that are easily understood and that, hopefully, will paint vivid images of the legal principles and implications of the ruling that will stick in the Justices' heads and will help influence how they think about the case.","What makes for a good argument, at bottom, is being more prepared than anyone else in that courtroom, and being willing to fight to tell your client's story - the story of why the right view of the law and my client's interests are one and the same.","Whatever a person's politics, lawyers have to understand that we are, for most people, the gateway for them to have access to the third branch of government."],"Patricia Neal":["A strong positive mental attitude will create more miracles than any wonder drug.","When you call upon a Thoroughbred, he gives you all the speed, strength of heart and sinew in him. When you call on a jackass, he kicks.","A master can tell you what he expects of you. A teacher, though, awakens your own expectations.","I may be a dumb blonde, but I'm not that blonde."],"Patricia Norris":["Living through the heat in Louisiana was awful.","As a costume designer, I first try to figure out what the character's economic situation is and hit the stores they'd shop.","I think people live in the past and tend to look that way, because they drop off when they're happiest and most successful."],"Patricia Polacco":["I didn't learn to read until I was almost 14 years old. Reading out loud for me was a nightmare because I would mispronounce words or reconstruct things that weren't even there. That's when one of my teachers discovered I had a learning disability called dyslexia. Once I got help, I read very well!","I don't care what color the parents are. I don't care if it's a giraffe and a fish living together. If they're raising children who believe they're honored and loved, that's all that's important.","I believe with all my heart that the American classroom teachers are one of our greatest and most heroic treasures.","I don't believe being gay is something you can change, no more than you can change the color of your hair or your eyes. Well, I dye my hair, so maybe that's not the best example. But your eyes!","Be kind to one another. You may need each other when you are older.","Maybe one of you can enlighten me, but I just don't understand why it is so hard to be kind to one another?","My family always encouraged my drawing ability. Kids in school who teased me about my reading would get out of their seats and stand behind my desk as I worked and go, 'Wow, you can really draw.' Later, I earned a degree in Fine Art and got a Ph.D. in Art History.","My stories are fundamentally about the love of family.","I used to say to my bubbe, 'Bubbe, is this story true?' And she'd say, 'Of course it's true! But it may not have happened.' What my bubbe was saying is profound: All stories are true. The truth is the journey you take through it - did it make you laugh, cry, seek and want justice? Then it's true.","I don't know if my work is a concerted effort to make kids sad! But life and death go hand in hand. It's our condition as human beings.","When I was growing up, we never had much money. My parents were divorced young, but I was always surrounded by loving individuals. They couldn't give us riches, but they gave us their stories, their hearts, and their time.","My appearances are almost theatrical performances. I bring items for the children to see, such as photographs and actual piece of meteorite, a family quilt, sometimes spectacles, sometimes clothing, so that they can understand what I write about is family stories based in fact.","Until we learn to honor and respect what other people believe, I think we are doomed.","All of us have a 'voice' inside where all inspired thoughts come from. When I talk to children and aspiring writers, I always ask them to turn off the TV and listen to that voice inside them.","What I loved the most about Oakland was that all of my neighbors came in as many colors, ideas, and religions as there are people on the planet. How lucky I was to know so many people that were so different and yet so much alike!","My stories deal with multicultural situations as well as multigenerational settings.","Show me an Irishman who can't tell a story - I don't think they exist.","Now, I've got to tell you: 'In Our Mothers House,' I don't think is for a kindergartner.","Generally, what adults want to know is my background, why I write what I write, and very personal insights that some say are inspiring.","I have been in more classrooms than any legislator will ever walk into in their lives, and I see wonderful, caring, dedicated teaching out there.","I lived the first five years of my life on a farm in Union City, Michigan, with my mom and grandparents. It was the most magical time of my life.","I came from a family of incredible storytellers, but I didn't start writing children's books until I was 41 years old.","My books cover many aspects of daily life through which your children will recognize their own relationships in their families and communities.","My parents were divorced when I was three, and both my father and mother moved back into the homes of their parents. I spent the school year with my mother, and the summers with my dad.","I don't know if my work is a concerted effort to make kids sad!","I wasn't a very good student in elementary school and had a hard time with reading and writing.","When you come from a family of storytellers, you're doomed. You just have to tell stories.","I could walk into anyone's home one time and draw a three-dimensional architectural plan of the inside of their home from memory, but I could not add up a column of numbers."],"Patricia Rae":["One of the first things that I did was, I got myself a publicist as soon as 'Maria Full of Grace' premiered in July, so that I could go and meet people that I wanted to meet: the writers and the directors and the people that are doing things.","A family is really a union of two separate entities. When you get married, you are marrying one family into another.","You don't always necessarily see eye to eye with the people that you are getting married into you, so you really have to learn to open your mind, open your heart and be super compassionate about other people's points of view, faith and opinions."],"Patricia Reilly Giff":["Revision is the heart of writing. Every page I do is done over seven or eight times.","Do you all have a living room floor or a bedroom floor? Then you can write a book.","To me, family is everything. I want children to realize how important their families are and what a support system a family is.","I want to see children curled up with books, finding an awareness of themselves as they discover other people's thoughts. I want them to make the connection that books are people's stories, that writing is talking on paper, and I want them to write their own stories. I'd like my books to provide that connection for them.","Sometimes when I visit schools, kids will interview me for the school newspaper. They ask me questions and my answers tend to go on and on, and they try to write down everything I'm saying as quickly as they can. And one day, a kid holds up her hand and said, 'Do you think you could just answer 'yes' or 'no?' Aren't kids wonderful?","Everything in my life affects my writing. There are no separate parts of my life.","What inspired me to become an author? I think it was the snow in New York. I looked out the window and I said, 'Well, I have to get dressed every morning to go to teach, but if I write a book, I can stay home in my bathrobe, eat candy corn.'","I cannot outline. I do not know what the next thing is going to happen in the book until it comes out of my fingers.","When I sit and talk with a person, I'm not always paying attention. I'm looking at the person and saying, 'What is it about his or her life that appeals to me?'","If you have a friend, things are better than if you didn't have a friend.","All of my books are based in some way on my personal experiences, or the experiences of members of my family, or the stories kids would tell me in school.","Outside of family, writing is essential. To me, it's like breathing.","The reasons kids get into trouble in one way or another is because - Who ever told them they were special?","I loved teaching. It was my world. I only left because I was overwhelmed with three careers - teaching, writing, and my family.","I have no special talent, you know. I never took a writing course before I began to write.","Anyone who has problems, or worries, anyone who laughs and cries, anyone who feels can write. It's only talking on paper... talking about the things that matter to us."],"Patricia Richardson":["Instead of yelling and spanking, which don't work anyway, I believe in finding creative ways to keep their attention - turning things into a game, for instance. And, when they do something good, positive reinforcement and praise.","I kind of feel like people like to dump on 'Home Improvement,' and I don't know why.","I curse too much. I really do. I have a horrible cursing mouth.","Losing their reproductive rights is the first step to how women live in Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan.","People who meet me think of Jill and transfer her strong qualities to me.","They see me as being this Super Mom on TV who also can more than handle a difficult husband, and they assume I'm going to be just full of wisdom as a mother and wife myself.","The truth is, I've been going pretty much nuts all year. I constantly have to fight being scattered. I feel like I'm on automatic pilot from fatigue. The hardest thing is trying to be present, living for the moment, for everybody in the family.","But then my mother, who's a very selfless, stoic person from a family of Marines, would tell us that what was good for our father was good for us - he would make more money; therefore, we'd be able to get better educations.","Tim on the show does a lot of that posturing, of course, and feels sort of threatened by women. But even at that, you do see him cooking, and ultimately he's a good father because he spends a lot of time with the boys.","I'd like us to deliver a little message to all the men still out there who think it's the '50s, and coming home simply means watching television with a beer.","I don't understand that, because I think that what people like most about the show is that they recognize themselves in the characters and their problems, so the more believable the family is, the more we can draw the audience in.","You have to be the parent; you can't be their friend.","It was extremely hard going from being a parent of one to a parent of three, because now all these instant decisions have to be made about how you balance out the time and attention between them.","I know it's a lot harder for women who don't have enough help, but the truth is, no matter how much money you have, if you want to stay involved with your children and don't want to lose being a primary parent to them, you're still in the game.","I still get the kids to the doctor and dentist and plan their play dates and buy their clothes.","Getting married and then having children just centered me and grounded my values. It was like a whole new world. It started happening in New York with a little play called Cruise Control, where I relaxed, and then I kept getting work in Hollywood till this series happened.","Good actresses can often accomplish miracles, and it is possible to be someone you've never been or will be. But in a sitcom, there's no time.","I always hated perfect TV moms because I always thought that was unrealistic.","Part of the whole L.A. mentality that nothing really matters unless it's a success... is such a shallow and dangerous attitude to have.","Television is a real woman's medium... but what's disturbing is, still even in television, women have so little to do with what's going on behind the scenes.","I live in such a sweet world in the world of 'Home Improvement' that I tend to be drawn to stuff that's really on the other end of the spectrum entirely.","I had been a real problem child, but once I got into acting, my parents never had any more trouble with me because all of that energy was directed in a positive way.","I have born-again Christians in my family, and they are completely against abortion... Everybody's got to stop being afraid of it real soon. Who's going to do it if a woman's network doesn't? People are going to be dying.","I didn't want to do comedy again. It is way harder when you are doing comedy. You can't just concentrate on the character and the plot. In comedy, the writers, instead of obsessing about character and plot, obsess about the jokes.","When you're a woman with a certain amount of fame and money, you are never certain what someone's motives are.","I've had so many horrible things happen in my life since I did 'Home Improvement' that it's worried me about doing comedy because - how do I say this - I'm a much darker person than I was.","You go where you think it's good for your work and your soul to go. I need to go someplace where I am reminded about why I wanted to act in the first place, and for me, that's the theater.","I really was about to pass out during my entire wedding. I just didn't know if I could marry anybody."],"Patricia Riggen":["I have years of saying ideas that are not listened to. Then, weeks after, of producers finding out that I was right when some other guy comes in and says it. Sometimes I just tell my idea to my editor or to some other guy with maybe gray hair to share it, and then it's brilliant!","I have a handicap in that English is not my first language. So even though I'm a writer, I don't write anymore because it's just harder in English.","I've always seen movies in English with Spanish subtitles. For audiences around the world, the language is less important than if it's a good film.","It never crossed my mind to be a director, and I'll tell you why: because I'm a woman. It just didn't occur to me, but I knew I had to be in film.","I finally, you know, moved to Mexico City, where the film industry is. I started working there as a producer, which is a very, very valid thing for women to do, because we always produce for men, right?","I went to New York City to Columbia University, and with the first directing exercise, I knew I was a director.","I wish I had seen some women directing before - that would have given me the idea of who I was.","When I was in college, my graduation thesis was called 'Female Directors.' I interviewed all of the important female directors from Mexico. There were four. That was it.","I love getting people's opinion of what I'm doing.","It's a very tricky relationship, the cinematographer and the director as a woman.","I think the three Mexican directors that came before me did a very good job in Hollywood because they came in and started directing things like 'Harry Potter.'","I do find that it's easier to get Latino-themed movies... but I don't think there's that stigma anymore. I think that what's harder is to be a woman, not to be a Latina.","I think the three Mexican directors - Alejandro Inarritu, Alfonso Cuaron, Guillermo del Toro - gave all of us foreign, and particularly Latino, directors a big break.","Directors only have instinct to work out of, because there is no formula. Formulas don't work. Actually, if you follow a formula, you will probably end up with a bad movie.","The only thing I have is instinct and intuition and just staying very, very connected to the moments and try to bring in what your gut is telling you.","I like making movies that people feel inspired by, a film that they will think about a few days after seeing it, and not entertainment that is completely forgettable the moment you walk out of the theater.","I am tired of having to prove myself constantly, even after being hired. Every single day, every single idea, I need to prove myself. I am tired of it!","The idea that women compete or don't like each other or undermine each other or sabotage each other, that's a big miss. That is not true at all. At all. My women connect with each other instantly and help each other.","There are a lot of female directors in documentary, very talented. But it's always lower budget.","Chile's mines are very dangerous; the country has a lot of earthquakes.","The problem of working in a mine, you are inside the belly of the monster, and it controls you. The air you breathe, the stones that fall on your head, we had to be on guard.","I have worked steadily since I started, but things are very hard for women and need to change.","I am grateful that I'm working, but I also have to say I've worked really, really hard and had to fight a lot.","Every single line, every single thing has to be fought over. There's kind of like an intrinsic doubt from absolutely everyone in my crew, my producer, everyone. It's not just the film industry - it's a worldwide thing. It's the culture of the world to doubt women.","I love the Kathryn Bigelow example: she didn't just do war movies - she did them better than other directors.","To get a movie star, you have to give them two hours of screen time.","If your film is in English, it makes it that much easier to get a wide release.","Americans are more likely to watch a film in their own language. For the rest of the world, it doesn't matter so much."],"Patricia Schroeder":["A draft doesn't produce the people we need to satisfy our real manpower shortage. We need specialists to keep our jets flying.","When it comes to college education, American families are paying more and getting less.","When men talk about defense, they always claim to be protecting women and children, but they never ask the women and children what they think.","Spine transplants are what we really need to take Reagan on.","The Pledge of Allegiance says, 'liberty and justice for all'.","One of the problems in the Navy is that tradition of being captain of the ship. And an awful lot of people can be retired in the Navy, get over it, get a life, and go on. But there's a lot who can't. And when they have to give up the ship, they got to be captain of something, every single day.","It's outrageous that many enlisted people qualify for food stamps because military salaries are so low.","When people ask me why I am running as a woman, I always answer, 'What choice do I have?'","We're going through the Olympics. We're watching women working as teams. We're watching men working as teams. We're watching all working as teams. We're proud of men and women getting medals. That's how the Navy should be working.","I have a brain and a uterus and I use both.","Nobody ever says to men, how can you be a Congressman and a father.","If the search engines don't respect the creators, there won't be anything to search in the future because creators have to make a living too.","Many women have more power than they recognize, and they're very hesitant to use it, for they fear they won't be loved.","The mood of the 80s - Get what you can, can what you get, and sit on the can.","Traditional copyright has been that you can't make a full copy of somebody's work without their permission.","You measure a government by how few people need help.","The Navy runs their process. The House of Representatives doesn't do anything about their process. We do not select. Navy officers select.","My entire history with the Navy have been trying to get the Navy to focus on families and child care and all the things that they were way behind in - housing, all of those things.","The only study that the federal government has engaged in with a vengeance is in trying to see if they can make women fertile after menopause.","Registration is a World War II response, and we need a 1980 solution.","Lobbying is a legitimate profession... Many congressional spouses act as lobbyists.","I learned a lot about America and a lot about Pat Schroeder, and that's why I will not be a candidate for President.","I could not find any way that we could really run the kind of campaign I wanted to run if we were targeting delegates and still trying to talk to people, which is what keeps me going as a human being."],"Patricia Sun":["When we don't have information, we go to the simplest outlook, to black and white. But then we have to lie to ourselves. Black is never as black as you're painting it and white is never as white.","You can't take sides when you know the earth is round.","Nothing will ensure war more certainly or entrench rivalries more seriously than for or against thinking!","The discoveries of how we can grow and the insights we need to have really come from the inside out. To have genuine empathy, not as a make-nice tool but as an understanding, is essential to the next step.","There is only one thing keeping us from having heaven on earth: we can't believe it! Why? Because we don't want to be wrong - so we'll be right and make it hell!","We have magnificent brains, but we use a great deal of our brilliance to keep ourselves stuck and ignorant, to keep ourselves from not shining. We are so afraid of our beauty and radiance and brilliance because it scared the adults around us when we were children.","We mostly feel fearful because we feel powerless. We feel powerless, I contend, because of a style of thinking that splits information in two poles that makes us lose all the operative information we need to solve the problem."],"Patricia Velasquez":["Always work hard, be honest, and be proud of who you are.","I have no doubt I was someone very interesting in a past life.","If there is one creature that represents my essence, it's butterflies.","Thank God I had all these family values or who knows where I'd be now.","Every time you play a bad girl or guy in a movie, you really come from a place of pain.","It takes one person to give you a big chance.","I used to be a dancer, and for me it was a really good combination of dance and acting.","OK, I've been very wild, but I've never really been the sort of person who goes that crazy!","There was a time when I used to live in Spain that it went really crazy with drugs and stuff like that.","I live in New York and I was only there for 2 weeks all last year.","You need a routine, to be able to spend some time with a person, and my lifestyle is constantly on the move.","I think if I could have a boyfriend like my brothers I'd be really happy. But without the brother thing.","I enjoyed working as a model a lot as it let me travel and I got to do some really interesting projects.","So struggling for work here has been very good for me, but it's also been very hard to handle rejection.","If I need something, even a pair of socks, my assistant has to get them for me.","Clothes, thank God I can get them from designers."],"Patrick Campbell":["From my earliest days I have enjoyed an attractive impediment in my speech. I have never permitted the use of the word stammer.

But they are totally focused. You can tell a good story, and they listen.","There are so many ways to tell a story. With multiplatform books, we are reimagining what literacy can be.","Getting to the point where I was ready to write a book has been about a 20-year journey of being, really honestly, too afraid to try - which I think is pretty common for people who are trying to write a large piece of fiction.","I remember all the way back in high school thinking about writing books. And, in fact, I've written a lot of stories. I've got dozens of stories I've written that no one's ever seen.","I took English courses in college, but I don't have an English degree. I have a degree in economics.","Yes, we're pretty into books around my house. We have lots and lots of books around. We have TV, but really no one ever watches it.","I travel to a lot of schools, and I see firsthand that while we do still have a lot of traditional readers, we don't have as many as we used to. And we're missing an awful lot of kids entirely... Do I want to get rid of the Internet? Obviously, I don't want that because of all the amazing things it brings.","I'm a relic, and things were a lot different when I was fifteen and sixteen. There were no cell phones, no laptops... I learned to type on an actual typewriter.","When I was a kid, I used to love it when one of my friends would jump out from behind a door and try to scare me. I always did the same thing in response.","Don't get me wrong - I love books! I just think a video has a bigger bang when it comes to a good, old-fashioned adrenaline rush.","There's something really fun about being scared, and I guess that was at least part of why I wanted to film certain scenes from my new book, 'Skeleton Creek.'","Like most people, there are things I love about Amazon. It's cheap, it's fast, and it's at my doorstep. But Amazon will never replace the important role my local indie plays in my community.","I'm a visual thinker, thrill seeker, and I'm easily distracted. I see everything I'm writing, and I think it naturally affects the pace of things.","I wasn't really conscious about 'The 39 Clues' movie when I wrote 'The Black Circle.'","My job as an author is to tell the story in the best way possible, to make it flow seamlessly and get the reader to keep turning the page."],"Patrick Carney":["Fast food is the one thing everyone can relate to. It's depressing, but also interesting, that people desire to eat the same sandwich in every single city in the world. But the biggest bummer is when you see a Subway in Berlin. Just devastating.","There is so much good music in the U.S. and there is just a small section that gets recognised at the Grammys.","Through the history of rock n' roll, you see lots of bands making the mistake of putting on the tights when they get to arenas. Don't do that.","I buy five of the same shirts. I literally have six blue shirts. Now I have six green shirts.","I think the best post-breakup album is The Strokes' first album. It's just fun.","The Midwest breeds funny, eccentric people, to varying degrees. You play shows not because you're expecting to get a record deal, but to do something fun outside of mowing lawns. Everything else is just gravy... Or mustard.","One day you look out and the audience consists of 65,000 people. It's like looking in the mirror and one day you realise you've gone grey.","I really don't have an ear for pitch. I can't sing at all, I can't hum melodies and I can't write riffs.","I wasn't raised super-poor, but my parents got divorced, and my mother didn't have much money. Even now if I have a cake, I'll eat it slowly, and I save most of the money I have.","Rock n' roll is dying because people became OK with Nickelback being the biggest band in the world.","I see a lot of comments on Twitter and stuff about how ugly I am, how bad I am at the drums, how awkward I look, and I'm like, yeah, I agree with most of those things.","When no one's buying your records, it's easy to justify selling a song. But once you start selling records, you can't really justify having two songs in Cadillac commercials. It looks greedy. And it is greedy. This whole music thing should be about music.","A lot of people see a Nissan ad and they see a finished product in a record store or on iTunes and that's the face of the band.","And once the music is out there, when you're selling a record and selling music and people are going to do whatever they want with it, it's kind of hard to resist certain opportunities, especially in the record market now.","I had this fascination with four-track recorders when I was in high school.","Well, you know what? The same people that get driven crazy by hip hop are the same people that probably listen to the type of music that drives me crazy. Like, Journey covers.","The best way to catch my attention is to throw a Twinkie near my face.","I can totally identify with the younger kids. I'll never do what Jon Spencer did to me when I was 16, though. I made a tape with my friends and I put it onstage right near his mic stand by the pedal board and he pulled it out with his foot, kicked it to the center of the stage, looked me in the eye and stomped it to pieces.","I'm friends with Dierks Bentley. Aside from that, I don't really know anybody else in the country music field, really. I've met the Lady Antebellum people and I met Marty Stuart briefly once. He's really nice, but I don't know any of them, really.","If you can't play guitar and sing in Nashville, you might as well just be a construction worker.","I was real into Devo, Pavement, Captain Beefheart, and the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion.","I'm trying to write a TV show. Ideally it would be just a reality-TV show, getting the guy who played Eddie Winslow and Kirk Cameron to live in a house. The Jehovah's Witnesses would come to the house a lot or something like that. I kind of like the idea of Scientologists and Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses trying to convert Kirk Cameron.","I'd literally rather hang out at the T.G.I. Friday's in New Jersey than tool around at a place that sells $40 cheeseburgers.","I imagine if Spotify becomes something that people are willing to pay for, then I'm sure iTunes will just create their own service, and they're actually fair to artists.","The idea of a streaming service, like Netflix for music, I'm not totally against it. It's just we won't put all of our music on it until there are enough subscribers for it to make sense."],"Patrick Chan":["I'll always represent Canada. I was born here, and my parents chose to immigrate here. There are so many things I don't see in other countries, I see here. I love having the Maple Leaf behind me.","There isn't quite a feeling you get from playing video games that you get when you're playing sports, which is like a sense of euphoria. You just get the satisfaction of doing something active and feeling good after.","When I was born, my parents were huge into skiing. I grew up on Mont Blanc, skiing on that hill. I was really a ski baby. Loved it; I still love it.","Experience is a funny thing. You don't always have it when you need it.","I know that, in hockey, the object of the game is simple in that you have to get the puck into the net. With figure skating, it's not as simple, and there is a ton of work that goes into it.","Traditionally, skaters tend to tie their skates very tightly. I tend to just tie my foot down, then in the ankle area, I tend to keep it loose. It gives me better mobility. But also, you're relying on your own strength as opposed to resting on the boot.","Even when I'm winning, hands-down the best, it's a struggle. I'm thinking, 'Oh, God! Just get me through this.' It's like surgery.","I was born in Canada for a reason. It was because my parents wanted me to have the freedoms that this country offers.","If you look at all the sports in China, the government is extremely involved and they are extremely proud of their athlete.","I'm slowly feeling more Chinese and feel I should be more proud of being Chinese and appreciate where I've come from.","I do love video games. But after a while, you feel like you really need to get up and do something.","I carry a lot of muscle easily.","Although it's hard some days to wake up an hour earlier to do the gym workout as opposed to other skaters who just show up to the rink, I know that if I don't do it, my day will be much worse. I might as well not even skate, actually.","Even though I'm very Westernized as an individual and very Canadian, I guess I've lost some of my Chinese culture.","I'm very proud I'm Chinese and represent the Chinese community.","I'm extremely well recognized in Korea just because of what I do on the ice, and there is a lack of that in Canada because hockey is our sport and it will be for eternity.","I skate just to satisfy my own desire and not care about other people's desire for me to do well.","I'm not good at multitasking.","I hope I can compete in one or two Olympics in my career. Of course I would like to win a medal, but just being there would be awesome.","I'm not a big traveller.","Paris is beautiful, but nothing beats home.","In skating or any amateur sport, as athletes we share something in common: the cost of training is quite a burden on our parents or on the athletes themselves trying to find a way to pay for their costs.","My parents are very good parents and have already said that they will look after me until the end of my skating career.","Injuries are a huge thing for skating. I think skating is a very unnatural sport for the body, very tough on the joints.","I tried all kinds of sports when I was a kid, like soccer and tennis and golf, and, in fact, started skating to be able to play hockey.","I love figure skating and what I am able to express creatively. I want to leave a legacy in the sport.","I can do all my jumps in practice, three in a row, five out of five, four out of five.","I can't count on both hands how many Grand Prixs I've done and how many world championships I've been to, so I think I've really earned the experience to know that when I step on the ice at nationals and when I step on the ice at the Olympics that I feel completely aware of my environment and what to expect.","In Japan, skating is like NHL hockey in Canada or baseball in the U.S., so pushing the limit is very enticing. Skating is their lives.","I'm going to stick to what I can do... because if I try and,,, do the impossible, I will either get too frustrated to the point where I won't enjoy the sport anymore, or I will get hurt and maybe have to get hip replacements at age 30.","I have a life outside of skating.","I get mad at my mom. I really wish she'd put me into hockey. I'm not gifted with height, but look at Martin St-Louis. He's unbelievable. He's small, but he's so fast, so skilful. I think I could have been pretty good.","When I go to competitions, I don't have so much confidence that I don't worry or get nervous about the other skaters doing well.","I'm competing against men who are doing five quads between the short program and the long program, and I'm at three between the two programs. Who would ever imagine that three wasn't enough for some people?","I have so much to give to skating in Canada.","The lifestyle of Vancouver does seem to really draw me towards there.","I have a good idea of how lucky we are to be growing up in Canada.","My skating brought me to a level of being well known in Canada, but I've grown up having trained in the U.S. I haven't lost my roots in Canada thanks to the little rpminders again when I come home: People thanking me for what I do and for representing Canada in the world stage.","All I can say is I'm proud to be Canadian.","The attitude is different in the U.S. I feel like, in Canada, there is more of a sense of community and more of a sense of, 'I'll take the shirt off my back to help you because you're my neighbour.' There is not many of us, right? So each and every Canadian is very special.","I relate really well to individuals who have a career and explore other adventures outside of skating. That, to me, is fascinating.","If I ever got in the way of Kurt Browning or Elvis Stojko, and they got mad and yelled at me, I'd be, 'Oh my God! I'm so sorry!'","I hope that people will one day look back at my skating and what I brought to the table. 'Remember when Patrick skated like this? Or remember when skating was like this?' That would be a cool legacy to leave behind.","Every Olympics, we always end up having someone on the podium that we had no idea, or we didn't expect them to be.","Skating has given me so many opportunities.","I feel proud to be a skater: it's taught me how to be emotional, more connected with myself, more mature, more understanding of my thoughts and the conversations I've had with myself.","Quads are very exciting to watch, but they're so quick, and they're very short moments in the program... I don't really enjoy it.","I was so proud to have the chance to be able to represent Canada at the Olympics in Vancouver."],"Patrick Chappatte":["Every village in Africa now has a cyber cafe.","Let's not let cartoonists get involved in a war of any kind, except for a war against stupidity.","We need to defend absolutely the freedom of speech.","Moderate people are able to be moderate and have free speech only because there are some people on the fringe.","A real totalitarianism is at work in the world and wants to impose its views not only on Arab Muslims, but on the West. The same way that they veil women, Islamic radicals want to veil cartoons in the press.","Some felt as if 'Charlie Hebdo' was obsessed with its 'Screw Allah' stance. It's a sort of provocation that caused a lot of debates.","We have learned the lines of good taste through history and our sense of guilt, be it post-colonial or post-Holocaust.","Today, fear of bloodshed is forcing us into recognizing new taboos: those of Muslims.","The big challenge our society faces is that we live in an increasingly open world with increasingly closed communities. This is also due to the evolution of the Internet, where people only read things that won't challenge their beliefs.","I don't think any media has to feel obliged to show the cover of 'Charlie Hebdo.'","You know what they say? They say, 'The print media is dying' - who says that? Well, the media.","The Internet has empowered us. It has empowered you, it has empowered me, and it has empowered some other guys as well.","Religion and political cartoons, as you may have heard, make a difficult couple, ever since that day of 2005, when a bunch of cartoonists in Denmark drew cartoons that had repercussions all over the world - demonstrations, fatwa, they provoked violence. People died in the violence."],"Patrick Collison":["I watch virtually no TV. All my screen time is computer time for me. When I'm not doing that I'm reading or talking to my friends who I got to know through computers.","One of the important lessons of the Internet is, how easy it is to get things done completely shapes what gets created. For that reason, technologies like Amazon's cloud service are very important. Even if they aren't technically impressive, they make things easy to do.","In 2007, there weren't any other accelerators, at least that I was aware of. We were almost the prototypical Y Combinator founders: We were highly technical but had never done a startup before. We also didn't know anyone in the Valley - investors, other entrepreneurs, potential hires. YC seemed like a great way to bootstrap that network.","I actually made a website called Y2 Combinator, which was the Y Combinator that starts Y Combinator clones. There's a very clear difference in the quality between the companies that come from YC and the companies that don't.","It's very possible that advertising business models will simply never do as well on mobile devices as those oriented around transactions.","When Facebook famously moved out to Palo Alto, there were people in the same house Facebook was based in working on different ideas. It is vital to remember that.","Stripe makes it easy for anyone, be it an individual or a small business or a large business, to accept credit card payments on the Internet. We want to give control to the user or the business to define what the experience looks like. We work on a website or a mobile app, or whatever between that.","Square is turning informal, cash transactions, like you would do with a taco truck, into card swipes. Stripe is more for the Internet, it's focused on the kinds of transactions that weren't possible years ago. We think about how you would buy things from a mobile phone, crowd-funding, how should that work.","The part of Stripe that I've always found most interesting is the idea of facilitating new commerce that wouldn't otherwise happen. Payouts is turning out to be a big part of that. These new networks are efficient, intelligent replacements for offline behemoths.","Our goal definitely isn't to sell Stripe."],"Patrick Cox":["I am like a sponge: I adore reading, watching films, and visiting museums and exhibitions. I am always in search of new things in many spheres.","If you use your own name as your business brand, keep in mind that if you lose that brand, you have lost your name. And that is a bit of a problem going forward in life. If you decide to make up a name, and if you have lost that name, then who cares. But when it is your name on the products, and you lose it, that is the game changer.","In fashion, my inspiration comes from pop culture - the 1960s and the following years. Whereas in interior design, my influences are much broader.","I couldn't have asked for a better testimonial than Bob Dylan parting with his own cash for a pair of my shoes.","I'm addicted to chinos the second weather gets warm enough.","It is all about quality of life and being proud of what I do. I need me to be me.","I am a magpie. My eye collects details.","My inspiration for interior design is more historical than traditional.","Show some originality and never wear one designer head to toe.","Rock stars love Cuban heels because a lot of them tend to be diminutive. And I've never met a man who doesn't mind having an extra inch or two anywhere on his body.","There is nothing worse than bright lighting - it isn't flattering and makes the glamorous women want to leave.","I've stayed in enough hotels so I really know what works and what doesn't design-wise.","Most of my holidays are with wonderfully generous friends with houses in the country or the South of France.","After selling the business, and the Patrick Cox brand in 2007, I had a three-year non-compete, where I just spent a lot of time hanging all over the world on beaches and having fun.","I finished college by July 15th, 1985, and by October 1985, I had a little stand during the trade show which was London Fashion week at the time. My stand was tiny - just 6 square meters in total - and I had my 12 shoes that I designed while in college.","As a designer, you are not only a designer, you are also a celebrity, an entertainer, and a spokesperson that speaks on behalf of the company. So you need to realize that you have to embrace all those sides.","Shoe design is like architecture - with the finest structure and tight, precise seams, it suits my obsessive neatness.","I'm a huge monarchist.","I like to be playful; I want people to look at what I do and smile.","I think a house should reflect the interests and personality of the occupant, but it takes time to gather together the objects one likes around oneself.","I lived in Nigeria, Chad, and Cameroon when I was very young, until my mother divorced my father.","Now, I'm older. I don't follow the vagaries of fashion: my look tends to be skinny flat-front trousers with a long-sleeve American Apparel T-shirt and a V-neck cashmere jumper - preferably Loro Piana.","Do I miss shoes? I miss the designing, but I don't miss the fashion industry. Those people eat their children.","I have a pop sensibility, which I think comes from all those weekends spent in nightclubs.","I came to London during what was called the second British invasion. The music was from Britain, the fashion was from Britain, everything was from Britain, so I knew I had to be in Britain.","Elizabeth Hurley rocks. She really rocks.","I don't eat at home, ever.","I love Italy, and that's where I make my own shoes. But the French really do respect designers. Italy is totally different; footwear is an industry. The shoes are all about craft and luxury. French shoes are more about straight lines, and they are way more geometric.","Archives can be inspiring but overwhelming. You have to forget them - especially when the whole world has been knocking them off. Everyone shops the same flea markets.","The word 'modern' is a cliche.","I'm not a shoe snob.","Copying is a form of self-validation.","I'm kind of the shoe guy.","I've learnt a lot about construction and flexibility from my time at Geox.","Wannabe was so huge. So big. So unexpected.","I used to sock hop to 'Crocodile Rock' and stare at those platform boots on the album cover.","I love talking in lira because, suddenly, everything is in billions.","By the time I came out of college, I was fabulous.","I was wondering if the best was behind me, had the high point of my career already happened. Then I saw what Manolo had done, and some of his best work happened after he turned 40.","I was never a fashion snob."],"Patrick Demarchelier":["The dog is the perfect portrait subject. He doesn't pose. He isn't aware of the camera.","When you are a photographer, you work all the time, because your eye is the first camera.","Photography is like a moment, an instant. You need a half-second to get the photo. So it's good to capture people when they are themselves.","Beauty is in the character of a person. It's about having an interesting face and about what's inside. Anyone can take a good picture.","When you're a fashion photographer, you must inspire a dream.","Photographers have to make the clothes look fantastic; that's why we get paid.","Photography is an accident.","Only amazing designers think of the truly new.","I don't stop at my past; I like new work. I like what I'm doing tomorrow.","Dior Couture is like art - they are the art pieces of a fashion house. Each piece is unique and made by hand.","I do like beauty, but an older woman can be beautiful and a clever woman is beautiful because that beauty shines through.","I love all women. Women are sublime beings. I love all of it: their eyes, their noses, their bodies.","My stepfather gave me a Kodak camera when I was 17 years old. I started working at a local photo store in Le Havre, France, taking passport pictures and photographing weddings.","When you grow up in the country in France, you have small horizons."],"Patrick Dempsey":["If biking is your passion, set aside time to enjoy a good ride.","I think dreams can come true, but not necessarily like fairy-tales. It's not always so perfect like that.","Now I'm just known as McDreamy, I've lost all identity as Patrick Dempsey, I'm now McDreamy.","I know it can be dangerous, but I love racing. I worry my wife, but she knows it's important to me.","My big thing is to make sure the lipsticks taste good when you kiss. And, well, so far they taste pretty darn good.","The best part about being married is feeling centered. Nothing else matters so much as long as you can come home and be with your family.","Nothing else matters so much as long as you can come home and be with your family.","I hate shaving. It's much easier to just do a little stubble, but my wife and daughter like it when I'm clean-shaven. If you see me with a clean face, then you know I'm in the kissing mode!","I grew up in a house full of women. I have two older sisters and my mum who is a very strong woman.","One day my 3-year-old daughter said 'Your very handsome, Poppy.' That was the best compliment ever.","My wife and I try not to get into each other's work too much.","When I left Maine, I always wanted to be a working actor. I never cared too much about being the star. I just wanted to do the work and get on with it.","I look forward to a time when my career in a place where I can get out of Los Angeles and find a nice small town like I grew up in to raise my family.","The worst part about being married is when you're not connecting. Your partner is going out the door when you're coming in, and you don't have a chance to debrief on the day. That's the worst.","Housekeeping is incredibly difficult with three kids. I'm trying to be more relaxed. You'll go insane if you try to have a picture-book house.","The hardest thing about having three kids is trying to find a balance, because there's always the odd man out, and you also need to make sure each child gets the attention he or she needs.","I started off as a juggler. I used to do a half-hour show on the weekends to make money as a kid. Then I went to Cleveland, Ohio in 1983 to the international jugglers competition junior division and came second. So that was my first job, being a juggler.","I did a play called 'On Golden Pond' in a dinner theater in Maine and then went to New York for a talent competition having put together a three-man juggling routine and some one-liners and I got myself an agent from that.","I think TV is much more the writer's medium and film is about the director and their vision and how you can collaborate with them and see that through to the end. They are so different.","And, sure, if you have a political point of view, you have every right to share it. But you have to be careful not to get too self-important. You have to find the balance between being entertaining and being preachy.","People sometimes mistake being serious with being taken seriously.","Drama is easier to do because you just have to have the emotion and not get caught acting, but comedy is much harder.","I love having a big family. I think it's easier, oddly, in some ways, having three children as opposed to one.","I like physical comedy. And I like the old comedies.","You'll go insane if you try to have a picture-book house.","If I can sleep in until 9 A.M. - wow, what a luxury.","As obvious as it sounds, I strongly recommend shopping at a specialty bike store. They are the experts, and they will be able to help you decide which bike is best for you.","With bikes, it is absolutely the case that you will get what you pay for. Invest in quality so it will endure wear and tear.","I have a specialized racing bike, which is great because it has a solid build, is comfortable to ride, and is lightweight.","When you discover first love as a teenager, your whole life revolves around it and you open yourself up to it.","I was 17 when I left the small Maine town where I'd grown up. I wanted to do something I thought was important with my life, so I headed to California and didn't look back.","Fame is a delicate and dangerous creature; I saw people who didn't honor it, who refused to take responsibility for it, get destroyed by it. I also saw that stardom in and of itself was empty.","In Los Angeles, as I gained and lost celebrity, then gained it again, I often found myself wondering why I, out of thousands like me, had become famous.","Sometimes in television, if there are storylines that are oft-told, people can be hypercritical of them."],"Patrick Duffy":["Good luck happens to people who work hard for it. Sometimes people just fall into the honey pot, but I've consistently strived to create whatever good fortune I can get in my life - and consistently strive just as hard not to screw it up once I have it!","Dancers are a work of art - they are the canvas on which their work is painted.","Every single unfortunate thing that happens, including, for instance, the murder of my parents, I am responsible for. I am responsible for being the son of two people who got murdered. I didn't cause their murder. But if I'm suffering because of it, it's my karma that I have manifested in this lifetime in this particular set of circumstances.","I'm one of the lucky actors in television. I don't make a lot of big waves, but there's constant activity, and that's the way I prefer to live my life.","I lead a normal life and I don't assume there is anything I can impart to people. The only reason to write a book would be to make money, and I don't want to do that. To write a book would be going against how I've lived.","It's great to be able to do shows like 'Falling in Love with the Girl Next Door,' which I think is entirely too long of a title.","I personally never thought that 'Dallas' would resurrect itself because I didn't think anybody knew how to do it. And it was proven to me on the few attempts that were made. The movie that was going to be done, I read that script, it was atrocious. It was just awful. And I just didn't think anybody understood it anymore.","It's as simple as you can explain all of 'Dallas.' We're a dysfunctional family forced to stay together.","There is no such thing as a weekend for me when I'm at home on my ranch in Oregon.","I do all the cooking in our family. I'm a utilitarian cook, rather than an adventurous one - I only have about 15 recipes in my repertoire that I rotate - but I love being able to go down to the river and catch a 30 lb. salmon, then grill it on the barbecue.","There's nothing I like more than picking fresh vegetables then putting them in the dinner you make that night.","Cooking and eating at home is made even better by the fact that you don't have to worry about driving after a couple of bottles of very nice wine. For me that's the ideal combination: working hard and enjoying the fruits of your labour.","I worked with my dad for 15 years. I apprenticed under him and decided I wanted to become an architect. So I went to college for it and then the acting bug got me.","I'm an inherently happy person. It comes from the inside, which means you can achieve happiness under any circumstance.","When I was on 'Dallas,' I was known to audiences of the '80s. And then when my sons, who are in their 30s now, were going to college, 'Dallas' was the cult thing to watch because it was being done on the soap channels, so a whole new generation saw it. And then I have the young fans that knew me from 'Step By Step' in the '90s.","Los Angeles is peopled by waiters and carpenters and drivers who are there to be actors.","The last episode of Dallas was in '1991.' Unfortunately, it was a terrible episode to end the show on: it was a sort of 'It's a Wonderful Life' with Larry as the Jimmy Stewart character. In that episode, I was an ineffectual-schlep kind of brother, who got divorced three or four times and was a Las Vegas reject.","I get up at sunrise. I'm a Buddhist, so I chant in the morning. My wife and I sit and have coffee together, but then it's list-making time. I have carpentry projects. We have roads we keep in repair. It's not back-breaking, but it's certainly aerobic and mildly strenuous.","I saw this thing years ago, where somebody filled a gymnasium with ping-pong balls and mousetraps. And then somebody threw just one more ping-pong ball in there, and literally, in five seconds, the room was popping. And then it was dead. And that's how it was with 'Dallas.' Just... 'boom!'","I quit it because at the end of seven years in an ensemble show with one leader, I thought: 'I will be known as 'Dallas' starring Larry Hagman and the cast.' And at this point in my career - I was in my mid to late 30s - I thought, 'Now is the time when it's hottest for me to go out and establish my thing.'","I feel that marrying younger and being quite a young dad helped me with the stability of my career.","I come from an alcoholic Irish background - I know where I was going! But I met my wife and started to practise Buddhism, which is a levelling experience for me, and there hasn't been a day I've missed in 40 years. I apply it to everything - to my work and relationships. I try to be a compassionate person.","I had a lump on my face and had a big cancer thing removed."],"Patrick Ewing":["Brooklyn, it's a great town, a great city. It's New York.","I've been to the Hall of Fame many times, in grade school and high school. I had field trips to the Hall of Fame and taking tours of it. I just never thought about that one day I possibly might be in it. I think it'd be great.","Every parent wants to see their kids excel.","Everybody always thinks the grass is always greener.","Whenever my body heals and the pain and all the swelling goes away is when I'll be ready.","Too much negotiating and not enough work on the court - that's what happened to me during the lockout. Too much talking and not enough training. I couldn't put in my usual offseason work routine. I think that all caught up to me, with my Achilles problems.","Amare, Carmelo Anthony, Chauncey Billups - they're virtually unstoppable.","Every time when they would call my name I kept hearing 'New York Knicks' instead of 'Seattle SuperSonics.'","I never knew what basketball was. I started playing on the playground. People used to laugh at me and joke at me because I was so tall and I didn't know the game and couldn't play it.","I wish I had stayed and finished my career here in New York.","I'm just like any person who is coaching in this league, I'm just looking for an opportunity, that's all.","I'm sure at some point I will get back into coaching, but right now I need to focus completely on my kids.","I've been an assistant for seven years now and I haven't had one head coaching interview. I'm doing something wrong.","If I want to average 32 points a game, I can do that easily. It's just eight, eight, eight, eight. No problem. I can do that anytime. That's not being cocky. That's confidence.","Most of the fans will still be Knick fans.","New York is a passionate city. They want a winner. They deserve a winner. I think we did an outstanding job of bringing it back.","Pat Riley, Dave Checketts and Ernie Grunfeld - they brought the Knicks back to the glory days. It started with Rick Pitino. We took our first step with him, making the playoffs. When Pat came in we just kicked the door open.","People think that just because you're a center, you're not as smart as the guards or the smaller guys.","This means a lot. I'm being recognized for all the blood, sweat and tears I put into a 17-year career.","When I played with the Knicks, I was just as important or just as smart as any other of the guards I played with. I still had to call out plays, notice schemes, know the systems, do everything they had to do.","Winning a ring is everybody's goal, whether you're a player or a coach."],"Patrick Fischler":["I am not a gamer. Not since the days of Atari.","I love things that people hate. I hate middle-of-the-road stuff. It never really interests me.","I've always been interested in the gangster genre, so to play Mickey Cohen was a real thrill. It's always fun to do your take on someone so iconic.","I do a lot of shows I've actually never seen, and I hadn't seen 'Castle' or 'Scandal,' but it's fun to just go into someone's world for eight days and do your thing, and then leave.","'Mad Men' still lives in my life as the best job that I've ever had because I thought the character was genius. It was so well-written.","I would love to play a regular guy in a family drama.","I totally respond to complex characters, and I'm not interested in anything too simple."],"Patrick Fugit":["I had an agent in Salt Lake City, but acting was more like a hobby.","My dad has a huge vinyl collection downstairs, but I was never too interested. The only CD I had was by Adam Sandler.","It's a very enticing, very seductive place, but once you get to know what L.A.'s really like, you don't want to live there.","I'm not a very fast-paced person.","The day after I got an agent, I got called in for a role in a TV movie called 'Legion Of Fire: Killer Ants.'","If you think you're going to work with Cameron Crowe and not get into his music, you're crazy. But he doesn't force it on you. He doesn't force anything on you, which really makes things easier.","One day, you're a nobody, and the next, you're in a movie that everybody is talking about. But Hollywood has a way of knocking you back down to Earth.","There are these girls who live in Maryland: they're the Patrick Super Fan Club Association of America. They've sent me videotapes of themselves just eating and talking about Hanson, and a loaf of bread that was really moldy by the time it got here.","Oh, I'm quite the impulse buyer. Most of what I buy is stuff for my Jeep, 'cause it breaks down a lot.","I always related most to Steve McQueen because he was more of an outcast than Robert Redford or Paul Newman."],"Patrick Geddes":["But a city is more than a place in space, it is a drama in time.","Each social formation, through each of its material activities, exerts its influence upon the civic whole; and each of its ideas and ideals wins also its place and power.","Instead of isolating our school and our many subjects from the every day world, we intend to plant it not merely in the French capital, but in what for next summer at least will be the focal point, the capital of the entire civilized world."],"Patrick Gordon":["The Indians gave up the land of their own free will, and for it received brass kettles, blankets, guns, shirts, flints, tobacco, rum and many trinkets in which their simple hearts delighted.","God be praised for his gracious long suffering towards me in sparing my life so long. Grant, gracious God, that I may make a good use of the time that thou mayest be pleased yet to grant me for repentance."],"Patrick Henry":["The liberties of a people never were, nor ever will be, secure, when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.","I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of experience.","Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!","We are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the God of Nature has placed in our power... the battle, sir, is not to the strong alone it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave.","Give me liberty or give me death.","Unite liberality with a just frugality; always reserve something for the hand of charity; and never let your door be closed to the voice of suffering humanity.","Are we at last brought to such humiliating and debasing degradation, that we cannot be trusted with arms for our defense?","I know of no way of judging the future but by the past.","If this be treason, make the most of it!","This is all the inheritance I give to my dear family. The religion of Christ will give them one which will make them rich indeed.","The great object is that every man be armed.","We are descended from a people whose government was founded on liberty; our glorious forefathers of Great Britain made liberty the foundation of everything. That country is become a great, mighty, and splendid nation; not because their government is strong and energetic, but, sir, because liberty is its direct end and foundation.","Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are inevitably ruined.","The Bible is worth all the other books which have ever been printed.","Shall we, who have laid the proud British lion at our feet, now be afraid of his whelps?","Do you remember any instance where tyranny was destroyed and freedom established on its ruins, among a people possessing so small a share of virtue and public spirit? I recollect none, and this more than the British arms makes me fearful of final success, without a reform.","It is a debt we owe to the purity of our religion to show that it is at variance with that law which warrants slavery.","Perfect freedom is as necessary to the health and vigor of commerce as it is to the health and vigor of citizenship.","It is natural to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes to that siren until she allures us to our death.","When the American spirit was in its youth, the language of America was different: Liberty, sir, was the primary object.","Fear is the passion of slaves.","The distinctions between Virginians, Pennsylvanians, New Yorkers, and New Englanders are no more. I am not a Virginian but an American.","I have now disposed of all my property to my family. There is one thing more I wish I could give them, and that is the Christian religion.","For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst and provide for it.","I have had many anxieties for our commonwealth, principally occasioned by the depreciation of our money.","Would any one believe that I am master of slaves by my own purchase? I am drawn along by the general inconvenience of living without them."],"Patrick J. Adams":["I was really a charmer; I was the guy who would get to the office, the principal would sit me down and within 10 minutes, we'd be, like, talking about some movies or something.","I just love shows that don't hand everything to you, that ask you to be smarter. I think that's something really important that HBO has done to change the landscape of TV.","My whole career is just terror, from beginning to end. That's kind of my thing. A lot of happy accidents happened.","I fell in love with acting, just going to a lot of plays. My parents went to a lot of plays, and I went to a lot of schools that would get plays for kids.","So, from a very young age, my mom tells me that I wanted to be Michael J. Fox. I didn't want to be an actor. I just wanted to be Michael J. Fox for awhile. And then, I realized that he was an actor, so I pursued that.","Anytime I met an actor, I just attacked them and said, 'How did you do this?' Eventually, I began to realize that you went to school for it. I wasn't a bright kid, so it took me a long time to figure that out.","My dad was a journalist. He was in Rwanda right after the genocide. In Berlin when the wall came down. He was always disappearing and coming back with amazing stories. So telling stories for a living made sense to me.","There was a small window when I wanted to be an astronaut. It may have coincided with not getting cast in a high school play.","Theater is a way to keep challenging myself.","The entire time I was up shooting 'Suits,' I was running back to my trailer to help get 'Nine Circles' produced. It's a no-brainer for me to keep that part of life alive.","It's the big question of every TV show, right, where you have these two people who it's clear the world wants to put them together and everyone wants to see them together, but also when you're telling these stories you can't throw these people together immediately.","What's really interesting and fun to explore is not just the falling in love and everything being great, but the obstacles to falling in love."],"Patrick J. Kennedy":["Terrorism is a psychological warfare. Terrorists try to manipulate us and change our behavior by creating fear, uncertainty, and division in society.","No one is immune from addiction; it afflicts people of all ages, races, classes, and professions.","Franklin Roosevelt said the test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance to those who have much; it is whether we provide enough to those who have too little. This reconciliation package fails that test as well.","Moreover, as the leadership of the House confirmed last year, the Administration remains opposed to a congressional resolution on the Armenian Genocide due to Turkish objections. This approach sends absolutely the wrong signal to Turkey and to the rest of the world.","In our pledge every day, we pledge one Nation under God with liberty and justice for all.","And how the government communicates about homeland security is central to how the public responds.","I believe that successfully addressing our national security needs while protecting our basic freedoms and civil liberties requires continual Congressional oversight, and I will continue to work to assert the role of this body in carrying out this grave responsibility.","If we do not provide education for every single American, we are consigning those without an education to second-class status.","I see the policy of opposing same-sex marriages or unions, whatever you call it, as bigotry or discrimination.","Americans have been given goals to achieve in Iraq, but not the standards by which to measure progress. And the only assurance Americans have been given that we can reach those goals is to trust the President and his Administration at their word.","As the bill requires, any terror alert system must give people and organizations some indication about what steps they must take to improve their own security and assist in the Nation's security.","Democrats believe that government should reflect the sense of community that Americans demonstrated after Katrina - the sense of community that has defined and united America throughout its history.","Facts are, insurance ratings are really dependent on the notion that some people are higher risk than others.","For students today, only 10 percent of children from working-class families graduate from college by the age of 24 as compared to 58 percent of upper-middle-class and wealthy families.","I am a recovering alcoholic.","If we had a terrorist attack, the way the people respond is going to determine whether that attack is just a tragedy or whether that attack becomes an all-out disaster.","In my state, over 17,000 households are going hungry on a regular basis.","In the 5 years, well over 60,000 American families have been broken apart by the absence of insurance because the only way for parents to get treatment for their children is to turn the custody of those children over to the State.","In the last 5 years, American employers have lost over $150 billion of productivity to depression alone. That is more than the GDP of 28 different States during the same period.","My mother is still battling alcoholism.","My state has the highest child poverty rate in all of New England, above the national average.","On the other hand, the American public possesses a great resilience and strength, and good risk communication strategies can tap into and even amplify those assets.","So if we are really concerned about generating more taxes, we ought to be investing in our people, not taking away the kinds of resources that contribute to their ability to become greater taxpayers in this country.","The key battleground in the war on terrorism, therefore, is in the minds of the American public.","Today, our economy is about an economy of ideas.","We believe in some basic human principles - everyone should have the opportunities not just to survive, but to excel with their God-given talents and abilities. Those are the values that should be reflected in our budgets.","We could have a budget that brings Americans together."],"Patrick Kane":["I've always prided myself on being myself and trying to stick true to who I am and how I was raised.","There are some guys you definitely would not want dating your sister - especially hockey players.","I've noticed if you look too far ahead, it only works negatively on you.","It has been a motto of mine my whole life - just be yourself.","I know the person I am, and I know the person I can be.","I think I owe it to myself to put my best effort forward and prove how good I can be.","You spend enough time with someone, you're going to have your run-ins.","I wouldn't be face-washing anyone in real life. I'd be skating to the bench real fast to get away.","Obviously, you want to help the team win in any way possible. If that's scoring goals, great.","I still love playing the game, and it's amazing we can do this as a so-called 'job,' and it's amazing we can come to the rink every day and play the game we love.","It's funny: when you're skating around during warm-ups, I'll see signs that say things like: 'Kane, Prom?' We have a fun, young team, and girls are asking you to the prom and giving you their numbers.","I love to score goals, and I love to plan my celebrations.","I love scoring for the fans, for the team, for myself. That's not to say that I won't pass if I see a teammate in a better scoring position. But I like to score.","Just try to focus one game at a time, not worry about points or anything like that. Worry about playing the right way and see what comes of it.","When you're 18, 19, you think you know everything, but you have no clue about anything.","I want to be someone who can be a role model to kids - and to everyone, for that matter.","I like having those preseason games and exhibitions to really get ready for the regular season and get yourself off to a good start.","There are great fans in Chicago. I think you'd rather have them recognize than not recognize you.","I think for me, personally, I'm a guy who has watched ESPN ever since I've been growing up. You turn it on, and it's one of the first stories - the Blackhawks and hockey, which you don't really see on that station. That's cool to see.","If I score a goal on the road, I come home, and that's probably the first thing I'm doing, pullin' up the laptop and watching. Can't watch it in front of the teammates, or else I'll get made fun of.","When I go down the ice, I feel it, the wind in the side of my hair, and then I got the party in the back.","A lot of the players that I play with who are Canadian, they call me Patty. Before then, I never heard it. I didn't mind Patty.","I stickhandle a lot at practice. I watch a lot of hockey, so I try to either pick up something from other players or watch some video and see what kind of move would work in the same situation.","I think the big thing is you really have one chance to do this... to play hockey for a living, you have one chance at your career, and you have to take full advantage of it.","It's always cool to go to different places and see what's really out there in the world.","I did charity events with the Cup all the time.","For me, I was really lucky to go to a city like Chicago where the team was struggling at the time, and I was able to go in and play right away.","For PSP, we play the 'SOCOM' game as a team on the plane, and it's pretty cool because you can connect to everyone.","You grow up... you spend five years rooming with each other, and you're going to get sick of each other at times. And you're going to have some good times as well.","I'm probably the guy who keeps it loose around the room and tries to joke around with guys before the game, keeping things funny.","I love the game of hockey. I love being part of it. I think I know a lot about the game.","People might not view me as competitive as I really am.","If I was bigger I might not have had the same skill set as I do, the speed.","For me personally, I try to use my size to my advantage where I can either slip by guys or try to create more space for myself.","I probably spend the most time with Toews: we have the same schedule, and we're roomies on the road; we sit next to each other. We do a lot of promotions together.","I like Joe Sakic. Coming out of Buffalo, I obviously like Alexander Mogliny, Pat LaFontaine. Hasek is up there. Miroslav Satan. Whoever seemed to be a good player at the time I'd watch. Jagr too. I tried to learn a lot from those guys.","It's obviously disappointing and surreal when you see someone else win the Stanley Cup.","Obviously, not playing a game before playoffs is something that happened, but especially going into the playoffs, you try to feel yourself out, where you're at, and then get right into game tempo and jump right in and play where you were before the injury.","Anytime you hear different things - whether it's trade rumors or people saying you're not living up to your complete potential - you're obviously going to get ticked off about that.","Especially in the day and age now with social media and cameraphones and things like that, you always have to act like you're being watched.","I love to play the game, love to be around the rink, and love to joke around with my teammates and have some fun.","The little kids in the stands are going to give you a good cheer. Sometimes, that overrides the other people.","It's good to get out there and kind of move the body around a little bit, play some hockey, enjoy Nashville as a city and spend some time with family and friends.","It's good for the NHL to implement different things - the 3-on-3, money that'll go to players - to try to get us to play at a higher level.","I don't want to be satisfied with where I'm at or happy about what I've done. I want to keep pushing it.","You want maybe to be that guy or one of the few guys who can help develop the game in the United States.","I don't know if I expected to be a captain of an All-Star team. It's pretty cool.","I'm just kind of focused on playing the game and try to get better at certain things and wipe the slate clean every night.","Sometimes it's nice just being in your own room and having a quiet night and relaxing and getting ready for the game.","If you do something wrong, it's going to be all over the place. Not only does that go for me, but anyone in here. You just really have to be aware of it.","I think you grow up every year, every day. You learn something new and try to really worry about what's important in life.","Something even minor I do is going to be reported because of things that have happened in the past. You have to be aware of that.","I try to pride myself on being involved with the fans and taking pictures when they're asked for because I know I was that little kid one day that really looked up to stars like myself, and I try to give them that on my behalf.","My favorite thing to do in this world is to be on the ice playing hockey and try to entertain fans and bring wins to the Chicago Blackhawks.","It's kind of crazy to think I'm still 22 and going into my fifth season. Time has been flying by. I think it's about that time I really take the next step to the elite level.","It's good when you're getting points - you're obviously feeling confident.","It's pretty funny, just driving by in a cab, and you see a huge billboard of yourself on the side of a hotel, like a 100-by-100 poster hanging up.","It's kind of cool to have the whole country at your back. Not just a city, but the whole country is rooting for you.","That's something USA Hockey has been trying to do for a long time is prove that we can play with the Canadians and the Russians and the Swedes and Finns consistently on a tournament basis.","I'm not out there to be blocking shots or fighting guys. I'm out there to produce offensively.","We're here to win. We're not here just for the experience.","Whether it's just walking down the street to try to go to a movie, go to dinner, something like that, there are always a few people that recognize you.","I myself feel that I'm a well-rounded player and got a lot better defensively and without the puck as time has gone on.","I think, for me, I'm a player that wants the puck, and I'm a better player when I have it.","Just try to get the puck and make plays, not so much worry about scoring or getting an assist or points, just try to get it and make plays. That should take care of itself.","Understanding where to be in your own zone really takes some time and development to learn.","As an offensive player, you always want to produce and score goals, especially when that's your job on the team.","Obviously ,you want to demand the puck; you want to have it as much as you can because you feel like good things can happen when it's on your stick.","I think you try to improve every season and every game and be prepared about certain defensemen you're playing against, certain ways to find open ice.","Since I was drafted by the Blackhawks, the people of Chicago have really embraced me and treated me with nothing but respect.","It's great to be able to continue my career in Chicago. Playing with the best organization in sports and the best fans in the game is a blessing.","I know hockey is growing in the U.S., and it's becoming more popular, but anything to get the game out there and see how we view it. We view it as the best game in the world.","I think sometimes when you play those extra shifts, it gets you into the game a little bit more and gets you a little bit more involved.","I'll always welcome some extra shifts and some extra ice time, and it's my job to be as prepared as possible to play those minutes.","It's cool that I'm 20 and am on the cover of the video game. A lot of kids play hockey, and a few get drafted, and only a few get to be on the cover. It's a great feeling.","I always go home to Buffalo in the offseason. I really enjoy my home town."],"Patrick Kavanagh":["It might be said that the pose of absolute honesty is the most dishonest one of all.","Natural life, lived naturally as it is lived in the countryside, has none of that progress which is the base of happiness. Men and women in rural communities can be compared to a spring that rises out of a rock and spreads in irregular ever-widening circles. But the general principle is static.","I want to reveal in a simple way the usual - and unusual - life of the city; the corporation workman, the busmen, policemen, the civil servants, the theatres, Moore Street and also, what occupies so large a place in Dublin's life, the literary and artistic.","The exciting quality about Joyce is that when you read him, you are not told of the large public issues that were agitating the minds of politicians and journalists on those days. Joyce is interested in the mind of a man who has put five shillings on a horse.","Life in cities is not a spring but a river, or rather, a water main. It progresses like a novel, artificially.","What appears in newspapers is often new but seldom true.","Undoubtedly, there are a number of well-developed, mainly female, stars helping Miss Taylor to hold the film industry together: Sophia Loren, Anita Ekberg, etc. But such an insistence on cheesecake smells of bankruptcy.","Young writers should keep out of pubs and remember that the cliche way of the artistic life is a lie.","How strange a thing like that happens to a man. He dabbles in something and does not realise that it is his life.","Malice is only another name for mediocrity.","Letting the facts speak for themselves is an immoral principle when we all know that facts and figures can be selected to prove anything.","There is nothing as dead and as damned as an important thing. The things that really matter are casual, insignificant little things.","Wine and women do not go with song. Alcohol is the worst enemy of the imagination.","A poet is never one of the people. He is detached, remote, and the life of small-time dances and talk about football would not be for him. He might take part but could not belong.","A man is original when he speaks the truth that has always been known to all good men.","In its truest manifestation, where it gives judgments, poetry is super-luxury. It would be interesting to see what would happen to a High Court judge if he were forced to follow the true poetic formula, doing the job for love, being forced into pubs for relief.","Ay - 'The Green Fool' business, the libel action over the head of it - did me a lot of damage. It destroyed the momentum.","The position is: the Gaelic language is no longer the native language; it is dead, yet food is being brought to the graveyard.","Publicity's a cancer. It eats out a man - till there's nothing but a shell left.","The keynote of simple folk is bad manners, familiarity. They intrude on one's private soul.","In the country places of Ireland, writing is held in certain awe: a writer was a dangerous man from whom they instinctively recoiled.","Poetry is not Irish or any other nationality; and when writers such as Messrs. Clarke, Farren and the late F. R. Higgins pursue Irishness as a poetic end, they are merely exploiting incidental local colour.","Yeats, protected to some extent by the Nationalistic movement, wrote out of a somewhat protected world, and so his work does not touch life deeply.","In the dear dead days beyond recall, when I was in my prime as a film critic, the industry was booming. Hollywood, to give them their due, always called it the industry, through quite a few imagined it as an art form and went through several hours regularly at tiresome films in the sacred cause of art.","The second-grade films - where are they? No more are they made, and yet they were by far the best films for holding hands at, and wasn't this always the main purpose of the cinema?"],"Patrick Labyorteaux":["Lots of TV shows say that they are like doing a movie every week, but 'JAG' truly was a huge show. Lots of once-in-a-lifetime opportunities, like being launched off an aircraft carrier and being welcomed by military bases all over California.","David James Elliott and I keep in touch via phone.","I love working! I'm a huge fan of TV and will be happy as long as I'm getting to be creative.","Michael Landon was the biggest influence. As a child, I watched him write, direct, star, and produce a TV show every week. He showed me what was possible."],"Patrick Leahy":["Stealing is stealing. I don't care if it's on the Internet or you're breaking into a warehouse somewhere - it's theft.","The American public is sick and tired of being lied to.","I'm a gun owner.","Why do the President and Vice-President constantly change the subject when asked to explain why things are going so badly in Iraq? The answer is simple. They have been consistently wrong about Iraq, and the results speak for themselves.","I'm an old trial lawyer.","Our alliances and our credibility are crucial elements of our working capital in advancing America's interests in the world, and they have been eroded over the last four years.","The rights of copyright holders need to be protected, but some draconian remedies that have been suggested would create more problems than they would solve.","You get fifteen democrats in a room, and you get twenty opinions.","We need to consider nominations as thoroughly and carefully as the American people deserve. No one is entitled to a free pass to a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.","There have been 111 Justices in the Supreme Court of the United States. Only three have been women. If she is confirmed, Solicitor General Kagan will bring the Supreme Court to an historical high-water mark, with three women concurrently serving as Justices.","Judiciary is where my passion is.","A lot of people in my state of Vermont are gun owners.","A victim is a victim is a victim. We should stop setting up standards that say we will have one standard of law enforcement for one group of victims but not for another."],"Patrick Lencioni":["Teamwork requires some sacrifice up front; people who work as a team have to put the collective needs of the group ahead of their individual interests.","The kind of people that all teams need are people who are humble, hungry, and smart: humble being little ego, focusing more on their teammates than on themselves. Hungry, meaning they have a strong work ethic, are determined to get things done, and contribute any way they can. Smart, meaning not intellectually smart but inner personally smart.","Engaged, enthusiastic, and loyal employees are pivotal drivers of growth and health in any organization.","When leaders throughout an organization take an active, genuine interest in the people they manage, when they invest real time to understand employees at a fundamental level, they create a climate for greater morale, loyalty, and, yes, growth.","Whether we're talking about leadership, teamwork, or client service, there is no more powerful attribute than the ability to be genuinely honest about one's weaknesses, mistakes, and needs for help.","Teamwork is a strategic decision.","Success is not a matter of mastering subtle, sophisticated theory but rather of embracing common sense with uncommon levels of discipline and persistence.","Failing to engage in conflict is a terrible decision, one that puts our temporary comfort and the avoidance of discomfort ahead of the ultimate goal of our organization.","The majority of meetings should be discussions that lead to decisions.","When team members trust each other and know that everyone is capable of admitting when they're wrong, then conflict becomes nothing more than the pursuit of truth or the best possible answer.","Meetings are the linchpin of everything. If someone says you have an hour to investigate a company, I wouldn't look at the balance sheet. I'd watch their executive team in a meeting for an hour. If they are clear and focused and have the board on the edge of their seats, I'd say this is a good company worth investing in.","The best kind of accountability on a team is peer-to-peer. Peer pressure is more efficient and effective than going to the leader, anonymously complaining, and having them stop what they are doing to intervene.","If you could get all the people in the organization rowing in the same direction, you could dominate any industry, in any market, against any competition, at any time.","Clients don't expect perfection from the service providers they hire, but they do expect honesty and transparency. There is no better way to demonstrate this than by acknowledging when a mistake has been made and humbly apologizing for it.","Trying to design the perfect plan is the perfect recipe for disappointment.","For organizations seriously committed to making teamwork a cultural reality, I'm convinced that 'the right people' are the ones who have three virtues in common - humility, hunger, and people smarts.","There is almost nothing more painful for a leader than seeing good people leave a growing organization, whether it's a priest watching a Sunday school teacher walk out the door or a CEO saying goodbye to a co-founder.","The problem is too often they are boring, and boring in a meeting happens for the same reason as in a book or movie - when there is not enough compelling tension. Meetings should be intense.","What clients are really interested in is honesty, plus a baseline of competence.","You have to build trust among team members so that people feel free to admit what they don't know, make mistakes, ask for help if they need it, apologize when necessary, and not hold back their opinions.","Team members need to learn to leverage one another, and that doesn't happen over a golf game or on a phone. It happens by getting together and taking the time to know each other.","Having to re-recruit, rehire, and retrain, and wait for a new employee to get up to speed is devastating in terms of cost.","Life is full of surprises: new opportunities come up; that's part of the fun - the adventure of life. The thing is, chaos doesn't allow us to enjoy the adventure.","Team synergy has an extraordinary impact on business results.","Conflict is always the right thing to do when it matters.","Hungry people almost never have to be pushed by a manager to work harder, because they are self-motivated and diligent. They are constantly thinking about the next step and the next opportunity. And they loathe the idea that they might be perceived as slackers.","You can go to work and actually make someone else's job less miserable. Use your job to help others.","Although most executives pay lip service to the idea of hiring for cultural fit, few have the courage or discipline to make it the primary criteria for bringing someone into the company.","The truth is that intelligence, knowledge, and domain expertise are vastly overrated as the driving forces behind competitive advantage and sustainable success.","We learn by taking action and seeing whether it works or not.","Enron - although an extreme case - is hardly the only company with a hollow set of values.","The fact is, employees cannot make breakthroughs if they can't openly and honestly disagree with their peers and their leader. Indeed, great leaders don't just permit conflict; they actively try to elicit it from reluctant employees as well.","Employees who can't trust their leader to be vulnerable are not going to be vulnerable and build trust with one another.","I have many times marveled at how I could feel so good about myself while eating peanuts in a middle seat on Southwest Airlines and yet feel so condescended to in first class on United.","Smaller groups of people can establish trusting relationships.","At its core, all authentic growth depends on more customers wanting more of what your company offers. Any other drivers - pricing gimmicks, heroic marketing efforts, forced acquisitions - are ultimately destructive.","On great teams - the kind where people trust each other, engage in open conflict, and then commit to decisions - team members have the courage and confidence to confront one another when they see something that isn't serving the team.","Employees that feel known and they feel like they know why their job matters and they have a sense of measuring it stay later, do extra work, and are committed to the organization above the requirements that they have.","I'm kind of a reluctant guru.","You need to make sure you hire people who are capable of being strong team players. Team members should fit the company's culture, be committed to the team, and be capable of being genuinely vulnerable and selfless.","I have yet to meet members of a leadership team who I thought lacked the intelligence or the domain expertise required to be successful. I've met many, however, who failed to foster organizational health. Their companies were riddled with politics, various forms of dysfunction, and general confusion about their direction and mission.","Where there is humility, there is more success, and lasting success.","Your focus should be on creating an environment where growth can occur and then letting nature take its course.","Contrary to popular wisdom, the mark of a great meeting is not how short it is or whether it ends on time. The key is whether it ends with clarity and commitment from participants.","I've spent many a long flight talking to flight attendants, trying to understand what kind of employment experience underlies such a consistent lack of concern for customers.","God bless those employees at United who somehow continue to be gracious and patient and generous with customers even while bearing the brunt of a broken company themselves.","The sad fact is that it would be fair to say that United is a generic, bureaucratic, tired company. A sort of DMV in the sky. No real culture. No real strategy. No real expectations for employees or customers. All of which is a shame.","When employees feel anonymous in the eyes of their managers, they simply cannot love their work, no matter how much money they make or how wonderful their jobs seem to be.","I've seen it again and again in my consulting: Most teams are too large to be innovative, despite their leaders' best intentions.","If you really want to step up your team's creative thinking, take a hard look at how many people you're putting in a room together. More than three to five is probably too many.","When truth takes a backseat to ego and politics, trust is lost.","Without trust, the most essential element of innovation - conflict - becomes impossible.","Too often, companies focus on systems and structures that facilitate cultural change at the mid-management level, overlooking problems closer to the top.","Too many executives I've met over the years have the mentality of a bodybuilder; they've come to accept the idea that growth is synonymous with success.","Some companies simply aren't meant to be bigger than they are. They provide products and services that satisfy their customers in a way that pays the bills, produces reasonable profits, and allows them to keep their people employed and fulfilled. And there's nothing whatsoever wrong with that.","Are your people uncomfortable during meetings and tired at the end? If not, they're probably not mixing it up enough and getting to the bottom of important issues.","When team members openly and passionately share their opinions about a decision, they don't wonder whether anyone is holding back. Then, when the leader has to step in and make a decision because there is no easy consensus, team members will accept that decision because they know that their ideas were heard and considered.","What's amazing is that so many leaders who value teamwork will tolerate people who aren't humble. They reluctantly hire self-centred people and then justify it because those people have desired skills.","Smart people tend to know what is happening in a group situation and how to deal with others in the most effective way. They ask good questions, listen to what others are saying, and stay engaged in conversations intently.","If you have doubt about a person's humility or smarts, don't ignore it. More often than not, there is something causing that doubt.","Irrelevance is the feeling that an employee gets when they don't see how their job really makes a difference in someone else's life in some large or small way.","Every employee needs to know that there's somebody out there that they serve. And when we don't let people know that for one reason or another, we're depriving them of a fulfilling job.","Conflict is the pursuit of truth.","Even though I wrote 'The 3 Big Questions for a Frantic Family,' my life is as chaotic as most people's.","I coach soccer, and my wife and I are very involved in our kids' lives. Our family is busy with doctor appointments, soccer practice, school, work, travel, vacation... life.","Empty values statements create cynical and dispirited employees, alienate customers, and undermine managerial credibility.","Values can set a company apart from the competition by clarifying its identity and serving as a rallying point for employees. But coming up with strong values - and sticking to them - requires real guts.","If you're not willing to accept the pain real values incur, don't bother going to the trouble of formulating a values statement. You'll be better off without one.","Meetings are usually terrible, but they shouldn't be.","Hungry people are always looking for more. More things to do. More to learn. More responsibility to take on.","Anybody, and any company, can have a big run of success once, but if you're going to repeat that over time, you need to be aware that you need to keep learning.","Sometimes you're going to have someone on your team who's just not comfortable with being open. You have to ask yourself, 'Is this person going to allow us to be a real team?' Maybe they're not right for your team. You have to be willing to lose someone sometimes.","Great teams argue. Not in a mean-spirited or personal way, but they disagree when important decisions are made.","Team members need to be able to admit their weaknesses and mistakes, to acknowledge the strengths of others, and to apologize when they do something wrong.","Members of great teams confront each other when they see something that isn't serving the team.","I never accepted the premise that meetings themselves were bad.","A lot of times, people find themselves in a meeting where the primary purpose is to receive information, and that's a poor use of people's time. Those meetings can be easily dispensed with and can be an email instead that people read in their own time.","If you don't know what your family stands for and what your life situation is, you're in trouble.","Home is most important in the long run.","People who have a sense of peace that their priorities are in the right place also have a sense of humility and a realistic view on life.","The best leaders over the long term are those who have a sound home life.","I hate touchy-feely things.","Team members have to hold each other accountable. If there's a meeting, all members have to commit to be present and to help one another; they can't just check out when they feel they're not getting any benefits.","If you want to lead, you better love people. Even if you don't like them, you have to love them enough to tell them the truth.","I know that any group of people can become a team if they do the right things, but I came to realize over time that if you acquire or develop the right kind of people, that process of building a team is going to be much more effective and easier.","Make sure that the people at the top are working together and there aren't divisions of labor. Don't have people working in silos; have them working across the team.","I work with CEOs and their executive teams... and very few of these people are really indifferent about their employees or their customers.","At the heart of every great movie is conflict. It's the same with a meeting. There should be conflict and tension."],"Patrick Lussier":["Ever since 'Star Wars,' there was a rash of how a movie was made. I remember that as a kid. I never really understood how movies were made until that movie, because it was such a technical accomplishment. Since then, you've seen more and more and more, for all different kinds of films, about what goes into the process.","It's fun to present stories that have a character that, really, everybody wants to be.","'Hellraiser' is an amazing world that Clive Barker created, and it is such a beautifully vibrant and surreal world within which to work. It is also not an undaunting canvas. It is a canvas created by an artist.","The key is to work with people who are passionate about storytelling and who have a similar sensibility of the type and nature of the stories that you want to tell."],"Patrick M. Byrne":["Over the next decade, there will be disruption as significant as the Internet was for publishing, where blockchain is going to disrupt dozens of industries, one being capital markets and Wall Street.","The main event isn't bitcoin. It's using the blockchain to disrupt other industries and Wall Street.","There is an opportunity to recreate the financial world as we know it in the parallel universe that is the blockchain. We are writing rules for this whole new universe.","The virtues of the blockchain is that it would be that it's peer-to-peer settlement - no centralized settlement, no manipulation... And most importantly, there's nothing to capture. It's consensus based. It's stateless.","I've been in a room in Silicon Valley where on the wall they have 160 industries they think blockchain can disrupt. We picked six of them to focus on.","On the blockchain, you have a public ledger, which is the form of ownership. That means you are not doing net settlement - just netting everything down, which means that everything has been turned into fungible numbers.","You're going to start seeing open-source, self-executing contracts gradually improve over time. What the Internet did to publishing, blockchain will do to about 160 different industries. It's crazy.","For the first time in 6,000 years of human history, we can have peer-to-peer exchange where trust is not a problem anymore. And it's through the technology that underlies bitcoin. It's called the block chain.","I'm not wed to bitcoin's blockchain. I'm blockchain-agnostic.","Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are a form of money that's a stable field that the government can't destroy and can't distort. Because its creation is governed by the laws of mathematics. It can't happen any faster or slower than a certain rate, and it all sort of self-adjusts.","I'm not in the business of bayoneting the wounded. I feel the blockchain revolution is kind of my victory. I don't care whether I win it, someone else wins it.","There are regulators at the SEC and elsewhere who are really excited about the potential of the blockchain. They understand you can build a robust financial system - it would solve all your black swan problems. All kinds of mischief and games that are played in the current system become impossible in this system.","We are on a crazy strategy with our central bank. It's good to have alternative ecosystems. It's not that the dollar will go away, but we need other options if it crashes or wildly inflates.","t0 is blockchain-agnostic so, ultimately, we can use anybody's blockchain.","Right now, you've got three days between a trade and a settlement, with hundreds of millions in settlement risk tied up in that time. That all goes away in a blockchain system because you've reunited the trade with the settlement. They're not two separate processes.","People didn't know where they could trade. When everybody owes each other IOUs that can be in multiple places at once, that's how the system couldn't tell any more who owned what and who owed what to whom. Blockchain could have prevented 2008.","There is absolutely no reason in the world of blockchain to build in net settlement. It's like saying you have got a new Ferrari and we are going to put a lawnmower engine in it.","I've been all over meeting government ministers and such in Caribbean financial circles. There's a small blockchain movement in the Caribbean. They've been quite a bit more advanced than you might've imagined.","We know that flat and non-hierarchical systems use information best. I've tried to do that with my own company because it works better that way. And society at large will work better as well if we can get rid of these old institutions and hierarchies. New innovations like the block chain can make this possible.","When we look at government in Washington or what's happening on Wall Street, we see so much centralization. But really, our goals should be to eliminate and overcome these central institutions. And in recent years we have gained powerful new tools to do this, and most significant among those is the block chain, which is the software behind Bitcoin.","This is where the block chain is most useful and revolutionary: It helps us to overcome the problem of mutual trust in exchange, which will, in turn, make many of our modern central institutions unnecessary.","With the block chain, for the first time, we no longer need these central institutions for settlement or for guaranteeing the value of coins or for land titling. All of these functions can be replaced by a transparent public ledger that is safe from tampering and which can make value and ownership clear and open for everyone.","We want a money that some government mandarin can't just whisk into existence with a pen stroke.","A major impediment to economic advancement around the world is the fact that the vast majority of humans are unbanked.","Cryptocurrencies in general give us a stable medium through which we can communicate our information about values and prices in a way that no government mandarin can distort or usurp. For the predators who have used our central institutions to predate on the rest of humanity, it's a very bad development.","If we get to a world of digital securities, then there isn't a need for DTC and Cede & Co. anymore. It's a really huge step in returning to clean capital markets.","How high can bitcoin go? The real question is how low can the dollar go?","There are dodgy characters in Bitcoin. But there are dodgy characters in cash, too.","We want enough people adopting Bitcoin for a robust infrastructure. It's an act of patriotism. It gives the country a robust parallel system."],"Patrick MacGill":["There comes a moment on a journey when something sweet, something irresistible and charming as wine raised to thirsty lips, wells up in the traveller's being.","Marching thus at night, a battalion is doubly impressive. The silent monster is full of restrained power; resolute in its onward sweep, impervious to danger, it looks a menacing engine of destruction, steady to its goal, and certain of its mission.","Few men could explain why they enlisted, and if they attempted they might only prove that they had done as a politician said the electorate does, the right thing from the wrong motive.","Every battalion has its marching songs.","Divisional exercise is a great game of make-believe.","To the soldier, luck is merely another word for skill.","A clock struck out the hour of twelve, and the bird in the hedgerow was still singing as we marched out to the roadway, and followed our merry pipers home to town.","Even the distribution of rations leaves much to be desired; the fatigue party, well-intentioned and sympathetic though it be, often finds itself short of provisions.","I am one of the million or more male residents of the United Kingdom, who a year ago had no special yearning towards military life, but who joined the army after war was declared.","The soldiers' last meal is generally served out about five o'clock in the afternoon, sometimes earlier; and a stretch of fourteen hours intervenes between then and breakfast.","Save for minor ailments and accident, my battalion is practically immune from sickness; colds come and go as a matter of course, sprains and cuts claim momentary attention, but otherwise the health of the battalion is perfect."],"Patrick Macnee":["Retirement's the most wonderful thing. I get to enjoy all the things I never stopped to notice on the way up. After an extraordinary life, it's time to enjoy my retirement.","They call it The New Avengers but it's really the old Avengers with new people except for me, looking rather fat and rather old.","Who'd give up sunny California for the grey old Earls Court Road? I'm looking out at blue skies and the mountains and trees, and it's so beautiful.","Accomplishment is such a patronizing, dangerous word, isn't it? I haven't really accomplished anything. The most accomplished thing I've done is to have lived this long - 81.","These things don't just come, arrive and settle like a bird picking up a few bits of crumbs. They develop. I think the best word for these things is develop. They develop because of the human beings who just happen to be there at the time.","And in the Second World War, you didn't just read about it in the newspapers because you weren't allowed to read it in the newspapers. It was all censored, you know? So nobody knew what we were doing.","And that's what happened to that show. It started ordinary, it started really rather bad. As I said, there was a review that said, really, we think the commercials are better than the show. And then it gradually developed.","But I did an awful lot of work in Hollywood, and in New York for that matter.","I like most of the Humphrey Bogart movies because they had to act then, and they acted very well. Edward G. Robinson is probably the best actor I've ever seen on the movies.","I mean, everyone says Citizen Kane. It isn't that great, anyway. And Orson Welles I knew well, of course. He made other incredible films that no one would let him make, which were much better than Citizen Kane, really.","I was absolutely delighted that those shows have been preserved.","I went to acting school, but only for nine months. If you're an actor, you know, don't really need to learn how to do it.","It doesn't work that way, you know, because most parts that you think you'd do well, most other people don't. So they offer you something - The Avengers is a good example... I fitted into that because I came from that sort of background. It's not even acting.","So I find the fascination, the love, the incredible skill and everything to do with acting, writing plays, and doing them, just darling. Lovely. I love actors.","Television has some lovely aspects to it - and some ghastly aspects - but the theater itself was a wonderful invention.","The only danger about websites, you know, is people who remember something you did or said thirty or forty years ago, and bring it up against you, so you're going for a job and you don't get it.","The radio even weren't allowed to say there was a Holocaust and people were being killed right, left and center in these terrible camps.","Until the year 1967, it was a crime, for which you could be put in prison, to make homosexual love to someone in your own house. If they came in and caught you at it, you could be put into prison. This has changed - I'm talking about England, incidentally.","Well, you know, I was through the whole of the Second World War and saw all my friends killed.","I really think I'd have enjoyed the life of a Regency buck.","I loved Ingrid Bergman. I sat and saw her on the stage in a theater in the round.","I'm not surprised 'The Avengers' has such enduring popularity, because it was a groundbreaking series that changed television. It was the first show that put its leading man and leading lady on an equal footing and showed a woman fighting and kicking and throwing men around. That was a radical departure in its time.","The very first thing you learn if you're a gentleman is that you never compare one woman to another. That's the way of all death.","Linda Thorson was a great actress with a great body, but she arrived just as 'The Avengers' was losing its appeal.","I missed so much of the Swinging Sixties by working. From 1961 to 1969, I got up at 4.30 A.M., a car came for me at 5.30 A.M., and I was taken to our studio at Teddington or Elstree, and we filmed until I got home at 9.30 P.M., five days a week.","I'm not afraid of death. What's to fear? Once you're dead, that's it. Nothing. I don't believe in heaven or hell. That's baloney. What matters is the here and now. Yes, I'm 88, and there are things I can't do: I can't run a race or climb Everest. But isn't life magnificent?","I take great pride in recalling that I could open in a play on Broadway or in London's West End and fill a theatre on the strength of my name - Steed's name.","If I was Sean Connery, I would have been macho.","I'd grown up with a lot of women. My mother was a famous lesbian in the '20s and '30s, and I grew up with only women, so I was used to getting on with them."],"Patrick Marber":["When you're in your early 20s your love life seems to explode every 20 minutes or so. By the time you've reached your thirties, it is every five or ten years.","When I look back I can't believe I was so stupid as to direct Dealer's Choice.","Well, you just know, as a writer, I didn't really write one of the five best screenplays of the year. There were lots of brilliant screenplays; I was just one of the lucky ones who got nominated.","Theatre is how I first encountered art on any level.","The trite answer is that everything is true but none of it happened. It is emotionally true, but the events, the plotting, the narrative, isn't true of my life, though I've experienced most of the emotions experienced by the characters in the play.","It's one of the reasons I don't do drugs. One sniff and I'd go all the way.","It doesn't really feel like it's got anything to do with me. I mean, I know I wrote it, and all that and invented the characters and made it up, but it's Mike's film, so doing the press and stuff, it feels a little bit inauthentic. I was just one component of it.","I'm constantly having to be vigilant with a depressive tendency, an addictive tendency.","I'm a happily married man and I think to get married you have to be optimistic.","I'm a Golden Globe nominee, yes. It's very nice. It's a very nice thing, but I kind of think of all the awards I wasn't ever nominated for, for years and things.","I used to go with my parents and loved it, I was in school plays, and I started reading plays before I started reading novels. I'll defend it to the hilt. When theatre is good it is fabulous.","I mean when the play was on in New York I was starting to get film offers coming through, and since the film's come out I get offered more than I used to, but it happens incrementally.","I like them all - I don't always approve. I see myself as a sort of benevolent uncle to these characters, and I can see why they do what they do; sometimes they make some mistakes, but at heart I think they're decent.","I know it's a film and all of that, and it's a Hollywood film, but it kind of feels like this sometimes, when you're in pain and it hurts, and you're desperate. Or you are about to cross some moral line and it's so seductive and you just do... and all that.","I hoped the dramatic power of the play would rest on that tension between elegant structure - the underlying plan is that you see the first and last meeting of every couple in the play - and inelegant emotion.","But I'm the sort of person who, if certain structures topple, it could all go horribly wrong.","But I think the thing I'm proud of about the film is that there aren't many films - either independent films or mainstream Hollywood films - that are like this; it's of its own times, and it's the film Mike Nichols wanted to make.","Always when I directed the play, I was always trying to cast people not who were necessarily like the characters, but people who I felt had the essential component that the character had, some kind of soul for it.","A couple of flop plays, a death in the family, and it could all collapse."],"Patrick McGoohan":["Marriage is a wonderful thing.","Questions are a burden to others; answers are a prison for oneself.","But what is the greatest evil? If you are going to epitomize evil, what is it? Is it the bomb? The greatest evil that one has to fight constantly, every minute of the day until one dies, is the worse part of oneself.","It was a place that is trying to destroy the individual by every means possible; trying to break his spirit, so that he accepts that he is No. 6 and will live there happily as No. 6 for ever after. And this is the one rebel that they can't break.","I would rather do twenty TV series than go through what I went through under that Rank contract I signed a few years ago for which I blame no one but myself.","Mel will always be Mad Max, and me, I will always be a Number.","You can't totally rebel, otherwise you have to go live on your own, on a desert island. It's as simple as that."],"Patrick McHenry":["I think we need to start with Philadelphia and make sure that we actually get some election reform in Philadelphia. Actually, a recent election was thrown out by a federal judge because of corruption with the voting process in Philadelphia.","I got into the race and people literally laughed. They thought I had no chance of winning.","If you stop one terror attack in the U.S., it may be connected to multiple other plots out there that are connected. If you reveal that you stopped one plot, it may tip our hand.","Conservatives need to know how important it is to fill out the census. It is one of the only things our Constitution specifically asks of U.S. citizens and boycotting will just help liberals expand government even further.","We absolutely need to reform the Congressional budget-writing process.","It's often difficult for conservatives to separate overall government intervention from a question as simple as the census.","Letting someone down is not criminal action.","Marginal tax rates are the lowest they've been in generations, and all we can talk about is tax cuts.","The people's desires have changed, but we're still stuck in our old issue set."],"Patrick Modiano":["That's the miracle of fiction. I use it to spray on certain moments or places from my youth.","As a writer, one is always a little blind to what one writes.","I often have the impression that the book I've just finished isn't satisfied: that it rejects me because I haven't successfully completed it. Because there is no going back, I'm forced to begin a new book so I can finally complete the previous one.","I think I became a writer because I didn't know of anything else to do. Maybe some incident from my childhood influenced me.","I quickly realised that it is difficult to get started when writing a novel. You have this dream of what you want to create, but it is like walking around a swimming pool and hesitating to jump in because the water is too cold.","When I was younger, I just put off the writing until later in the day, but now I write early every morning to get it done. I can only write for a few hours at a time; after that, my attention fades.","Recently, I looked back at my first manuscripts and was struck by the lack of space, of breath. That's exactly how it felt, back then... like I was suffocating.","For a long time, I've had a recurring dream - I dream I don't have to write any more, that I'm free. I'm not free, alas; I'm still clearing the same terrain, with the impression that it's never finished.","I always have the impression that I write the same book.","I write in the most classical French because this form is necessary for my novels: to translate the murky, floating, unsettling atmosphere I wanted them to have, I had to discipline it into the clearest, most traditional language possible.","Because I find writing painful, I try to get it over with as fast as possible. But I write every day, or I lose the thread.","A novelist can never be his own reader, except when he is ridding his manuscript of syntax errors, repetitions, or the occasional superfluous paragraph.","Writing is a strange and solitary activity. There are dispiriting times when you start working on the first few pages of a novel. Every day, you have the feeling you are on the wrong track. This creates a strong urge to go back and follow a different path. It is important not to give in to this urge but to keep going.","Something happens between a novel and its reader which is similar to the process of developing photographs, the way they did it before the digital age. The photograph, as it was printed in the darkroom, became visible bit by bit. As you read your way through a novel, the same chemical process takes place.","A novelist's lack of awareness of and critical distance to his own body of work is due to a phenomenon that I have noticed in myself and many others: as soon as it is written, every new book erases the last one, leaving me with the impression that I have forgotten it.","Really, I prefer not to read my early books. Not that I don't like them, but I don't recognize myself anymore, like an old actor watching himself as a young leading man.","In the end, we are all determined by the place and the time in which we were born.","I've always had the wish, the nostalgia to be able to write detective novels. At heart, the principal themes of detective novels are close to the things that obsess me: disappearance, the problems of identity, amnesia, the return to an enigmatic past.","The more things remain obscure and mysterious, the more they interest me. I even try to find mystery in things that have none.","Encourage aspiring writers to continue writing when things are going against them, when it feels hard. Explain the typical obstacles that occur, and encourage and reassure them to continue, never to give up.","At the beginning, I experienced writing as a sort of constraint. Starting so young as a writer is pitiable: it's beyond your powers; you have to lay bare things that are very heavy, and you don't have the means for that."],"Patrick Murphy":["The political process does not end on Election Day. Young people need to stay involved in the process by continuing to pay attention to the conversation and holding their leaders accountable for the decisions they make.","Young people deserve stable employment opportunities and not mountains of debt. When young people can access the middle class, America is strengthened.","I got into politics because I was tired of complaining.","I don't think 'my way or the highway' works, that mentality. And that's what the Tea Party has done: drawn a line in the sand. I'm sorry - that doesn't work in business, that doesn't work in your family, it certainly doesn't work in government and our Congress.","The Tea Party movement went off on a more extreme agenda that I did not support at all, and was very frustrated by it, to the point that not only did I change parties, I decided to do something about it and run for Congress.","My dad's a Republican. My dad's my mentor. When I was 18 or whatever it was and I decided to register to vote. My dad's Republican, so that's what I decided to register as.","Whether it's threats to Medicare, cuts in education spending, or Internet privacy, the ramifications got young people out to vote and should be enough to keep them involved in our political system."],"Patrick Murray":["Any political party that includes the word 'democratic' in its name, isn't.","A Lawyer will do anything to win a case, sometimes he will even tell the truth.","I've had bad luck with both my wives. The first one left me and the second one didn't.","The only difference between a dead skunk lying in the road and a dead lawyer lying in the road is that there are skid marks around the skunk."],"Patrick Ness":["The world is cynical and sarcastic, but that doesn't mean that that's always the truth.","We have lost the idea that something can be secret because it is valuable, not because it's shameful. If you share everything with everybody, what have you got for yourself? I tweet and I blog, but I save a lot for myself. Not because I am ashamed.","I get tired of comedies where there are a bunch of funny guys and a beautiful woman who doesn't do anything funny. And I don't like books where there's a rough-and-tumble boy and a really clever, snotty girl. That's just not my experience with teenagers.","Folk tales and myths, they've lasted for a reason. We tell them over and over because we keep finding truths in them, and we keep finding life in them.","How you leave the reader is so important - not the climax; I call it the 'exit feeling'.","When I'm writing, I'm just in it and trying to figure out what seems best.","Online is such a brilliant, brilliant way to connect with young readers - even if they just want to tweet, 'Hey, I read your book!' - that, absolutely, I connect with that. But I also treat writing as solitary and keep it to myself as long as I can.","If you sing beautifully about nothing, no one will listen. If you sing badly about great stuff, no one will listen. Ideas are everywhere, but my theory is that a writer doesn't just think of an idea: they perform them.","Forget market or publishers or whatever. Just write with fire and joy, and in my own experience, those are the stories of mine people have wanted to read.","I got tired of books where the boy is a bit thick and the girl's very clever. Why does it have to such an opposition? Why can't they be like the girls and boys that I know personally, who are equally funny and equally cross? Who get things equally wrong and are equally brave? And make the same mistakes?","Your reader is interested in a guileless, fresh, first-time-we-talked-about-it way. What a great liberation that is. And teenagers, if you respect them, will follow you a lot further than adults will, without fear of being a genre that they may not like or have been told not to like. They just want a story.","In some ways. I always feel between worlds, between cultures, and I think that's not necessarily a bad place for a writer to be. Writers are kind of on the fringe anyway, observing, writing things down. I'm still mostly American, but it's a nice tension.","It's fun being paid to read stuff and air your opinion about it - pretty much a dream job for a writer.","I live in England, so I take a lot of trains, and you can't really go anywhere without somebody talking on their mobile phone behind you, forcing you to listen to their conversation. With the Internet, with texting, with networking sites, there's already information everywhere.","Limitations can be hugely creative and hugely inspiring - so long as they are the ones you choose for yourself. I will not allow anyone to take anything off my palette, but if I do, then within that, I can be creative.","A book cannot apologize for what people may think it should be. It has to be authoritative. That's what I want as a reader - I want to be confident that the book will do its job.","For me, when I start a novel, I only have a general sense of what I am going to do - usually three or four big scenes or something to which I can really respond emotionally.","The magical and fantastical isn't something I'm uncomfortable with in books, and I chafe slightly at the idea that a purely realist novel somehow has more value.","Whenever I have tried to write for other people, that's when my writing has failed, when nobody wanted to read it or buy it. But it's only when I've been able to write a story that makes me excited, only then have other people wanted to read it.","The books I like to read the most feel like they've been written by somebody who had to write them or go crazy. They had to get them out of their heads. I like that kind of urgency.","It's really important to me not to be a snob about age division or about genre or whatever. The story needs to be what the story needs to be.","I try to avoid describing one interpretation of my books. Of course I have an opinion. I have things I want to say, but I don't ever want to limit anybody, to have them say, 'Oh, he said this, so that's what it's about.' I'm happy people bring their own stuff to it.","The best characters in books are always the difficult ones, and why would you want to fall in love with someone difficult? The ones I'd fall in love with are the ones I'd definitely keep out of a book.","I'm a long distance runner, and I get my best ideas when I'm out running. It also helps that I can't write it down immediately - if you hold onto an idea, other things will stick on it.","Anything that anybody wants to give me is great! I've had folk songs, heavy metal songs, jewellery... I would never call anything any fan gives me weird, as it's how people express what they like about the books, what it means to them, and that's a wonderful thing.","I like writing for teenagers because they're not snobs.","I write 1,000-1,500 words. The next day, I rewrite it and add 1,000-1,500 words to the end of it.","I like writers who seem to write because they have to. You get the feeling of this burning desire to tell a story. I find it in Peter Carey, Nicola Barker, Ali Smith and David Foster Wallace.","Happiness is precious, and so I prefer to keep mine private. In a world where everyone shares everything, I can think of a lot of happy moments, but they're mine.","I meet blind and partially-sighted young readers all the time, and it's a shock that so few books are available to them.","No one wants to read an apologetic book.","I think the reason teenage fiction is so popular with adults is that adults hunger for narrative just as badly as teenagers do.","If I sit down to write a young-adult novel, then I'm going to write either to the punch-pulling expectation of what I can't do, or I'm going to go the other way and think about what can I sneak in to be 'down with the kids' - which would be excruciating.","If you set out to write an adjective novel, you're setting out to write a mediocre novel; your allegiance is to the adjective, not to the story, and then that just sucks all the joy right out of it.","If you're 15 and you tell someone a secret, they can put it up on Facebook. If you make a mistake, someone films it on their mobile and puts it up on YouTube. When you're 15, you deserve privacy.","Plot is a framework on which to drape other things. So once that's working, I can just let it go and do all the stuff that I love - 'Trojan horse' it. There are so many great YA heroines, and that's fantastic, but what about the emotionally complex boy out there? That's who I tend to write about.","I don't purposely push the boundaries... I think if you pay attention to a story, it will have exactly as much 'difficult material' as it needs, and nobody will complain about it because you've earnt it."],"Patrick Nielsen Hayden":["Before the Internet, before BBSes and Fidonet and Usenet and LiveJournal and blogs and Facebook and Twitter, before the World Wide Web and hot-and-cold-online-everything, science fiction fandom had a long-lived, robust, well-debugged technology of social networking and virtual community.","Back in 2008, when we were first preparing to launch Tor.com, I knew I wanted Jo Walton to be a regular writer for the site.","As a senior editor at Tor Books and the manager of our science fiction and fantasy line, I rarely blog to promote specific projects I'm involved with, for reasons that probably don't need a lot of explanation.","Tor.com has been a venue for original SF and fantasy since 2008, but we've never formalized our process for submissions. Indeed, for a long time, we were totally winging it.","I was ten years old in 1969, and while we lived in Arizona that year, I spent most of the summer staying with family friends in Portland, Oregon while my parents visited Spain. It was an adventure all around.","There's a latter-day notion that artsy hippie types in the 1960s disdained the space program. Not in my experience they didn't. We watched, transfixed with reverence, not even making rude remarks about President Nixon during his phone call to the astronauts.","Personally, I always find it especially piquant when cultural conservatives, usually quick to profess their devotion to the Free Market, rail against the success in said market of some product of which they disapprove.","In my own life, I've seen myself ramping up the amount of text I consume digitally. For me, it's the weight and inconvenience issue - I want anything that will spare me having to carry around reams of paper.","The small visual inconvenience of e-books is made up for with find and search functions, and the fungibility of digital text.","Obviously it makes a difference if an author has a public online profile of some sort, even just down to the level of having a moderately popular blog. Most books sell 5, 10, or 15 thousand copies. Most are midlist books. With those people, even a modest online presence can make a difference in sales.","I have a severe Google Reader habit. I think people will use blog forms and Twitter to contrive fiction."],"Patrick O'Brian":["You can't be happy if you're not tolerably happy with yourself. The addition of friends adds immeasurably to life.","Since I grew up, I have never deliberately used any technique at all other than the physical shaping of my tale so that it more or less resembles what has been thought of as a novel for these last two hundred years.","My wife and I have spent most of our lives in France, and we are both pretty well bilingual, my wife more purely than I, since as a little girl she went to school in French Switzerland.","A freewheeling mind can conceive a virtually infinite number of sequences, but just how that mind picks out and stores those that may perhaps be used later to deal with a given tension, a given situation, is far beyond my understanding.","I have never written for an audience. On the other hand I do not write merely to please myself.","I very much dislike being interviewed by the kind of journalist who tries to dig into your private life.","I've never set out to seduce my reader. I don't see him at all clearly.","About my books, that's all that I think the public has, in its normal way, to know. My private life is, by definition, private.","I have 60 years of reading to draw upon: naval memoirs, dispatches, the Naval Chronicles, family letters.","In a day when, if you insulted a man it might cost you your life, you were probably more civil.","Take a newspaper account of Waterloo or Trafalgar, with all the small advertisements: it seems much more real than reading about it in a history book.","When you're taking a fence on a horse, you don't think much; your body does all the thinking, and you're over or you're not over. It's much the same when you are doing a tricky thing with a pen. There are times when I'm writing very, very fast.","Likings arise when one has no earthly reason for liking - the most wildly improbable marriages and uncommon friendship.","The first interviews I gave were entirely unpleasant. You have people trying to trip you up with impolite questions that have nothing to do with the books. It's simply vulgar curiosity, and I won't have it.","In my case, I write in the past because I'm not really part of the present. I have nothing valid to say about anything current, though I have something to say about what existed then.","The function of the novel is the exploration of the human condition. Really, that's what it's all about.","On a ship, everything is enclosed: the people are right on top of each other and can't get up and walk away."],"Patrick Pichette":["It's important that you don't lie to yourself. If you lie to yourself, you end up with burnout.","The surprising question we get is, 'How many people telecommute at Google?' And our answer is, 'As few as possible.'","People think, 'Well, because you're at Google, you can work from anywhere.' Yes, you can work from anywhere, but many just commute to offices... Working from the office is really important.","There is something magical about sharing meals.","It makes no sense to make people drive cars.","We could auto-replenish as you take things out of the fridge. Why not?","Google is a very responsible company. It's a generous company, but it's very frugal in many ways.","People should understand that Google changes every day.","There is an obsessive focus on speed at Google.","With scale, there always becomes this tension of, how do you keep the start-up philosophy?","Google will continue to be the place of choice, and we wanted to signal that very clearly to our employees.","Relative to Google or the kind of turnaround we're seeing, we do care about profitability. That is our goal in every one of the areas where we invest.","Every time I can find another engineer to add to the Chrome OS platform, I'm going to hire him.","I guess you can run from Google, but you definitely can't hide.","Humans are animals of habit - they convince themselves they can't change. And that premise is wrong.","Once you have children, you're basically hunkered down until at least late high school.","People die at 100 years old now. When I was a kid, people died at 67.","I just didn't want a boss. The minute you're a CEO, you have a pile of bosses, and you're working 7/24, and you're on everyone's radar all the time.","If you're on Earth as a single-purpose engine, and there's only one thing you want to do for the rest of your life, have at it.","When you start traveling and thinking from a global perspective, you realize how small the planet is and how predatory we are to its ecology.","In the end, life is wonderful but nonetheless a series of trade offs, especially between business/professional endeavours and family/community.","Being your own person and standing for what you believe is a critical aspect of a good professional life.","The vast majority of young people I meet would benefit so much from a year off. You should just go waste a year in exploring the beauty of the world and trying the craziest experiences you can.","When work starts feeling too comfortable, fire yourself; go get another job.","I am a mild introvert. But I have learned to be a very successful extrovert because if you want impact, you have to work with people.","When our kids are asked by their friends about the success of the longevity of our marriage, they simply joke that Tamar and I have spent so little time together that 'it's really too early to tell' if our marriage will, in fact, succeed.","Working at Google is a privilege, nothing less.","I have made so many friends at Google it's not funny.","After taking a two-year sabbatical to spend time with my wife and travel the world, I'm excited to join the Twitter Board and help the company advance its mission.","If you live in the digital economy, you have to be careful to have your investment thesis squarely bolted into your reality.","On mobile, knowing where your friends are at any time is actually a pretty important part of your mobile experience.","People forget that YouTube is the second-largest search site on the Web. It just tells you the power of how many people live on YouTube.","If you think of what you do on your mobile and what you do on your PC, they're typically very different, and because they're different, they bring you additional value and additional opportunities.","Everybody knows: people, operations, and the HR component of Google is one critical strategic asset that we have.","I spend my weekends with my Android phone in an elastic band that has tied to my Android phone my driver's license and my credit card. That's how I live. I'm not carrying a wallet anymore. Like, a wallet is a medieval item, right?","People see the speed; people see the innovation, the relentless innovation, and that's what Google is about.","We all know that mobile's going to change the world."],"Patrick Rafter":["You've got to be realistic.","I don't know if Wimbledon's seen anything like it. I don't know if they will again. But it was just - it was electric. The Aussie crowd, I'm really proud of them, the way they conducted themselves. You know they're great losers, as well.","I'm sick of making bloody history.","I'm the sort of person who keeps a lot to myself.","Life's there to make the most of, and that's what I do.","I'm not that good a player, and I'll be the first to admit that. I might be a three or four grand-slam winner; I might be a two grand-slam winner, I don't know.","I'm not going to be a ten or twelve grand-slam winner. It's not going to happen."],"Patrick Rothfuss":["Fantasy is my favorite genre for reading and writing. We have more options than anyone else, and the best props and special effects. That means if you want to write a fantasy story with Norse gods, sentient robots, and telepathic dinosaurs, you can do just that. Want to throw in a vampire and a lesbian unicorn while you're at it? Go ahead.","After I'd been in college for a couple years I'd read Shakespeare and Frost and Chaucer and the poets of the Harlem Renaissance. I'd come to appreciate how gorgeous the English language could be. But most fantasy novels didn't seem to make the effort.","As authors, most - most authors, our art is portraying the human condition. Trying to show you what it's like to be somebody else, trying to make you feel for somebody else. That means you have to have a high degree of empathy.","A lot of new writers assume you have to know the where the story is going and that it flows out as molten gold. But really, sometimes you think you are going to one place, but then you decide that is dumb idea. Then you go somewhere else and it is a worse idea. But then you switch again and you might have a beautiful accident.","Humans are kind of story-propagating creatures. If you think of how we spend our days, think of all the time you spend on entertainment. How much of your entertainment centers around stories? Most pieces of music tell stories. Even hanging out with your friends, you talk, you tell stories to each other. They're all stories. We live in stories.","I started a novel back in high school. It wasn't very good. It was the opposite of good. The writing itself wasn't too bad, and the characters were interesting. But the story was a mess, and it was full of fantasy cliches. Dwarf with an axe. Barbarian warrior. I don't ever think I'd bother finishing that. It's just not worth my time.","One reason we love fiction is because stories have a comforting shape. They provide a resolution that's lacking in our regular lives.","You don't want the world destroyed, because, you know, that's where your shoes are.","When you're 14, anything with a sword and a dragon is pretty cool. But when you're 21 and you've read 2,000 fantasy novels, you start to realize that some of those books, well, they weren't really good. OK, let's be honest. A lot of them were crap.","The problem with dragons is that everyone uses them. All the time. When that happens, they become commonplace. A lot of people think you can just throw them into a story and suddenly whatever you're writing is 28% cooler. But that doesn't work. All that does is make dragons into some boring cliche.","You've got a great chance in college to do all sorts of terrible irresponsible things, and you should totally do them. I mean, make huge mistakes. This is the time in your life if you screw up, it's okay because you can bounce back from it.","It's profoundly disorienting to go from zero to celebrity.","I never set out to become 'famous.' I mean, when you're 14 you think 'I'm gonna become a writer and people will want my autograph and that'll be cool,' but you grow up and you learn that's just not how the world works. I resigned myself to the fact that I would probably never be published and if I did it probably wouldn't be a big deal.","Don't get me wrong, magic is cool. But a nervous mother singing to her child at night while something moves quietly through the dark outside her house? That's a story. Handled properly, it's more dramatic than any apocalypse or goblin army could ever be.","I was the kid who was too geeky for the other kids.","I almost got a psychology degree, I almost got a philosophy degree. I kept changing it so they couldn't make me graduate. I studied anthropology and eastern religion, epistomology, and astronomy... I took every interesting course I could find for nine years.","One thing I've learned now is that I should not say when a book is coming out until I'm sure I know.","You can have an interesting story about a person living an interesting life. And if it's done well, that is just as engaging as the end of the world. A million people dying - we can't process. One person, we can process.","The myth of writer as, like, Asperger-style misanthrope, or, like, the Jack Nicholson, 'As Good As It Gets' - it just doesn't work, because writers, in order to write good characters, need to understand people. You need to understand your audience. You need to have so much empathy you could almost encourage empathy in others.","I'm struggling with what is epic. People decided I was epic - if by epic, do you mean a big, heavy book? 'David Copperfield' is a big book - is it epic? Amount of time covered, length, drama, or story - that's the real appeal - if the story is long you have a better chance of becoming more connected.","I know better than to read reviews but I do it anyway. Somebody described my pacing as 'glacial.' I wasn't thrilled, but I think they meant it in a not entirely unflattering way.","I'm a fan of books that are almost languorous in their storytelling. That is a little bit lost sometimes in the modern media that we have.","I'm obsessive. That's the word for me. I obsess - perhaps to the point where it's moderately dysfunctional. I tend to put a book through about 100 revisions. If anything, that's an understatement. If there's another author out there who does this sort of revision, I would really like to meet him. Maybe we could form some sort of support group.","My mom once lost track of me at the zoo and when she found me I was lecturing a man about the difference between dromedary and Bactrian camels. I was about 3 1/2.","I've got an idea for a modern day faerie tale that I think would made a great short novel. But I just don't have the time to work on it right now. I'm way too busy with the 'Kingkiller Chronicles' and being a new dad.","I write what I don't know. It's way more interesting.","I've done a lot of interviews of the last few years, and I've actually started a list of questions that it would be fun to ask an author, but no respectable interviewer would ever ask. Since I'm not respectable, I'm going to start doing interviews with some authors I know, just for fun."],"Patrick Roy":["My quality of life here in Quebec City is extraordinary.","He punched me. If that's his best punch, he'll be in trouble some day.","I adore this adventure, I adore working with youth. For me it's a daily challenge, working to help these youths realize their dreams.","I don't want to play games with anybody, to our fans, to Pierre Lacroix, or any other NHL team that might have interest in me.","A big part of my decision is not made about whether I'm able to coach in the NHL or if I'm ready to step up and take that challenge. Basically, it's about my family, it's about my children, and this is where my decision is going to have to be made."],"Patrick Schwarzenegger":["I love to go shopping and see what catches my eye.","I'm very fortunate to have been raised in my family. I learned early about the importance of giving back.","My mother's nickname for me is 'Positive Patrick.' I like to live up to that title.","My mom raised me with the idea of doing public service, and I definitely want to go in that direction. But I also want to follow in my dad's entrepreneurial footsteps.","My grandmother always said, 'when you receive a paycheck, you always have to put a certain amount to your savings, and 10 percent right away to charity.'","I've always been into dressing nicely. My dad's really into fashion, also. We'll always go out and buy stuff. He has his own style and I have my own style, but it's a shared thing. Same thing with my grandfather; he was really into his style, so it's just sort of been passed down, I think.","I've wanted to do some sort of acting stuff down the line, but modeling is a good way to get comfortable in front of the camera.","My mom always talks about how hard it was to grow up in a political family. It's always split up, and just - I want to have fun in life. No, politics isn't on the list.","Fashion and wearing clothes is a daily routine for everybody. What better way to spread the word of giving back and philanthropic ways of life than to wear something that gives back to charity?"],"Patrick Soon-Shiong":["The idea would be in my mind - and I know it sounds strange - is that the most important advances in medicine would be made not by new knowledge in molecular biology, because that's exceeding what we can even use. It'll be made by mathematicians, physicists, computer scientists, figuring out a way to get all that information together.","You'd believe that a patient with hypertension, if you know you have hypertension or diabetes, you would take your drug every day. The compliance rate is more like 30% or 40%. Which means that 60% of patients don't take their drugs, and they actually go into these crises, end up in the hospital.","The foundations and the intent of the Affordable Care Act are laudable. The way it's being implemented is a disaster.","I like to look for patterns in science and life. It's what I do.","The pancreas is by far the most complex organ in the body.","I have an obligation to use what I know to try to bring real, usable medical science to every doctor and bedside and patient.","We need to and must protect privacy. But I think that people will be willing and even eager to share medical information about themselves for the greater good of mankind.","In South Africa, being Chinese meant I wasn't white and I wasn't black. I trained in Baragwanath Hospital, the largest black hospital in South Africa. That was around 1976, the time of the Soweto Uprising, when police fired on children and students who were protesting. I was part of the group of interns who volunteered to treat them.","I think of L.A. as truly the melting pot. It's basically a mini-country unto itself.","If you look upon chronic diseases as an epidemic, and you see that the chronically ill are the poor, then you see that this issue of the uninsured is not really a moral but a financial obligation to change health care.","There is no right or wrong way of giving. People in Los Angeles have made major contributions in different ways to the city: Eli Broad to art. David Geffen to hospitals. I'm not judgmental.","I want to do transformational work to actually fix the world.","I'm a physician. I've been blessed with ideas and resources to use technology to make the world a better place. That's what I would like to leave behind.","It's unconscionable that cancer patients get the wrong diagnosis 30 percent of the time and that it takes so long to treat them with appropriate drugs for their cancer.","My commitment is to Los Angeles, so whatever helps this continue to be a great city, that's what I would be focused to do, and the Dodgers are certainly iconic to Los Angeles.","It took 23 years from Abraxane being conceived to us showing now with conclusiveness that it works in pancreatic cancer. We cannot afford as a society to wait another 23 years to make sure that the patients get the right care, at the right time, at the right place.","What we discovered, counter-intuitively, is that when you start killing a cancer cell, one of the things it does in order to survive is to spread even further. It causes itself to form new blood vessels. We've termed this 'reactionary angiogenesis.'","We're really going after truly creating sustainability of a disease-free state, creating a complete system for managing cancer patients for life, so that you can manage from onset of disease all the way through.","You don't inherit cancer; you actually get it.","It was really an easy decision for me to be a part of the Lakers. It's priceless. It is one of the few places where I truly get lost in the joy of the moment of that game. All of the stresses and all the responsibilities are gone.","I'm truly passionate about basketball. I'm not as passionate about baseball as I am about basketball, but I watch baseball and I watch football. I love sports in general.","Baseball is like cricket, and I grew up in a country where they had cricket. So I understand cricket, soccer and basketball. I played basketball at the club level and a little bit in college, so that's why I'm a basketball fanatic.","We need to think of chronic disease, hypertension, cancer, like H1N1. In fact, there's an epidemic of chronic disease.","I love doing a lot of things I'm told I can't do. I think that's what drives me and keeps me awake every day.","I was working with stem cells as part of a NASA programme. We realised that the science of stem-cell proliferation was also fundamental to cancer cells when cancer enters the phase of metastasis.","You have in the U.S. around two million new diagnoses of cancer a year, and 13 million survivors, so you have about 10,000 patients that require analysis every day. That's about five petabytes that need to be transmitted and computed on a daily basis.","Yes, iD is a machine vision and sensor browser for the physical world. That's what we have been working on with Coca-Cola, Verizon, Bank of America and Disney to launch content when an image is recognised.","Every patient is a consumer, and every consumer is a potential patient. What NantWorks is doing is building the world the way Da Vinci saw it, and augmenting every frame a human being sees as they work, live and play.","I am convinced that in order for you, as a patient, to be protected, it has to be transparent, evidence-based, objective information. Not self-serving information. Not pharma-driven information. Not ad-driven information. It is transparent, objective, evidence-based information.","We know that if you just were to take the drugs that you were supposed to take for diabetes or hypertension, just take it, as opposed to not take it, we could save $7,000, $3,000 per patient per year."],"Patrick Stewart":["I would like to see us get this place right first before we have the arrogance to put significantly flawed civilizations out onto other planets, even though they may be utterly uninhabited.","One day, out of irritation, I said, you know all of those years with the Royal Shakespeare Company, all those years of playing kings and princes and speaking black verse, and bestriding the landscape of England was nothing but a preparation for sitting in the captain's chair of the Enterprise.","I wasn't campaigning for a role in a Hollywood television series, it was a fluke. So you've got to have a measure of good luck, you really have, being in the right place at the right time.","Having played many roles of scientific intellect I do have an empathy for that world. It's been hard on me because flying the Enterprise for seven years in Star Trek and sitting in Cerebro in X-men has led people to believe that I know what I'm talking about. But I'm still trying to work out how to operate the air conditioning unit on my car.","Last Wednesday, I stupidly dropped my iPhone in the bath, and my life has sort of spiraled almost out of control.","I don't do impersonations. I can do a wounded elephant! I can do a really good cow! And because of the amount of time I spent in North Yorkshire, I do a variety of sheep. All of which I will be happy to roll out for you!","I am told that there have been over the years a number of experiments taking place in places like Massachusetts Institute of Technology that have been entirely based on concepts raised by Star Trek.","As the captain, I was going to be having the dominant role in most of the episodes, and that was appealing. I wasn't interested in coming to Hollywood to sit around.","William Shatner has one style. We have completely contrasting personalities. We're very good friends. I adore him, but we're very different people, so they were smart enough to write characters that reflected that.","I never had teenage years. I guess because I was seen to be more adult than anybody around me.","I wouldn't know a space-time continuum or warp core breach if they got into bed with me.","It is what you do from now on that will either move our civilization forward a few tiny steps, or else... begin to march us steadily backward.","We've heard from many teachers that they used episodes of Star Trek and concepts of Star Trek in their science classrooms in order to engage the students.","One of the things that I've come to understand is that as I talk a lot about Picard, what I find is that I'm talking about myself.","The studio have always claimed that the ship is the star of the show, especially when they're renegotiating contracts.","There are several books that I have-the Physics of Star Trek, Star Trek and Business, there are manuals on command style and countless scholarly papers that have been written about the significance of Next Generation.","During my time we had two chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, at different times of course, on the bridge, both of whom asked my permission to sit on the captain's chair.","It still frightens me a little bit to think that so much of my life was totally devoted to Star Trek and almost nothing else.","I've met actors where you think, if only you could just clean up your act and get it together, people would want to work with you. Some people are so difficult, it's just not worth working with them.","Tom Hanks knows the name of all the episodes.","We had some very distinguished fans: I know one chancellor of a major university who used to schedule his meetings around Star Trek. We were thrilled to discover that Frank Sinatra was a big fan.","You get all of your neuroses worked out on stage. I haven't actually played very many nice characters, certainly not on stage. It's not a quality that attracts me.","I am not the archetypal leading man. This is mainly for one reason: as you may have noticed, I have no hair.","I was brought up in a very poor and very violent household. I spent much of my childhood being afraid.","Creating a believable world on the ship was very important, and technically they got better and better and better at showing the ship too.","As time went on, I did campaign to lighten the character a little bit, to introduce some romance into the episodes, outside activities, horse riding and fencing and mountaineering.","During the course of the seven years I played scenes with an oil slick, I played a scene with a grain of rice. Sometimes with indescribable creatures. I remember having a conversation with something which was simply a smell, that's all. It was part of our job.","For seven years I did very little theatre, and I have to make up some time.","I came to feel very, very sentimental about those sets, which is ludicrous, because they represent everything which is transitory and insubstantial. It's absurd that one should feel sentimental about timber and canvas.","I certainly wanted to maintain some sense of mystery about Picard and that's why we never allowed certain situations to fully evolve, like the relationship between Picard and Beverly Crusher.","Encouraging people to believe in it was the most important thing of all. It's one of the reasons I was always uncomfortable whenever film crews came on the set to shoot things. I didn't want our make-believe to be exposed.","I began directing episodes, which was a great light every couple of months. We never short-changed our audience, but it became something that you had to work at rather than something that was a pleasure.","I became a better listener than I ever had been as a result of playing Jean Luc Picard because it was one of the things that he does terrifically well.","Whenever the lion fish in the fish tank in the captain's ready room died it was always a sad moment.","The truth of the matter is, all of those guys on Star Trek: The Next Generation actually want to be me. These impersonations they do are just some way of trying to feel what it must be like to be me. And I understand that! Because it feels really good to be Patrick Stewart!","Roddenberry had created quite a complex and at times mysterious character. Guarded, cautious, careful in showing his feelings in expressing his ideas about many things - I found that very interesting.","It wasn't until the first season ended that I went to my first Star Trek convention. It was in Denver. There were two and a half thousand people there.","I've often reflected on this in the past weeks as I've been following the presidential campaign: Very often, I thought it would have been great for both of these guys to sit down and be force-fed a couple of dozen episodes of Star Trek.","The only still center of my life is Macbeth. To go back to doing this bloody, crazed, insane mass-murderer is a huge relief after trying to get my cell phone replaced.","I had come to the point when I realized it was unlikely that my film career was going to move beyond a certain level of role. And I was - because I had graphic instances of it - handicapped by the success of Star Trek. A director would say, 'I don't want Jean-Luc Picard in my movie' - and this was compounded by X-Men as well.","I think I came back from America a funnier and nicer person than I went.","Having spent so much of my life with Shakespeare's world, passions and ideas in my head and in my mouth, he feels like a friend - someone who just went out of the room to get another bottle of wine.","Wouldn't it be grand if we thought that theater could have that impact on the political life of a country?","But as I grew up as a child, falling in love with the theater and Shakespeare, my heroes were Sir Laurence Olivier and Sir John Gielgud.","The knights of the theater represented to me not only the pinnacle of the profession but the esteem in which the profession was held. To find myself, to my astonishment, in that company is the grandest thing that has professionally happened to me."],"Patrick Stump":["Everyone wants to pretend like they sprang out of the ground with an Animal Collective record in their hands and a David Bowie haircut, and that's just not the case. You discover these things gradually.","There's no first impressions anymore. You go to a job interview, and they'll probably Google you. It's a shame - people should play it a little closer to the chest as far as what information they release to the world. If I'm angry about something, I'm not going to take to my Twitter.","Good music is good music, regardless of where it comes from. I think that's a really important thing to carry with you.","'Punk' doesn't mean Mohawks and safety pins. It's about not conforming.","There's a certain fear of simplicity. I think that's the thing, when you're younger as an artist, you get this idea in your head that complexity equals quality. The more notes you're playing, the better.","Quiet is the new loud.","As far as criticism, I don't mind critics. I mean, I wrote for 'Rolling Stone' for a hot minute. I like criticism. I enjoy criticism. The thing I don't like is cruelty for cruelty's sake. You don't have to be a jerk to say something negative. You can say something in the negative sense and have class.","The music business is one of a few places where everything you've heard about it seems entirely cliche, but it's true.","I write really scathing, angry stuff when I'm in a better mood, and then uplifting and happy stuff when I'm at the absolute bottom.","Why do we make records? Because we want to say something. Why are you in art? Because you want to say something. The second you don't have anything to say, you stop making art - you might start making product. And I'm interested in being an artist.","I love Korean food, and it's kind of like home to me. The area that I grew up in outside Chicago, Glenview, is heavily Korean. A lot of my friends growing up were Korean and when I would eat dinner at their houses, their parents wouldn't tell me the names of the dishes because I would butcher the language.","When you make art, you get really invested in it. When art happens by accident and you were just along for the ride? It's way more fun.","When you're a little kid, you just like music that makes you happy and is fun. As you get older, you reach college or your 20s and you decide that music should be challenging and all art should be smart. So you start to think it makes you like high art more to put down things you consider low art. I don't even think things are low art.","I lost about 60 pounds. I don't really have a moment specifically that made me do it. I remember little things, like, when I was in Japan, I remember looking around at the portion sizes of a fast food restaurant and being like, 'Well, this has something to do with it.' Americans definitely eat too much.","I always thought 'Stump' was kind of like, you dropped something on your foot. It's not the most exotic rock-star name.","I think you can totally be a totally normal kid from the suburbs of Chicago and go off and play shows. It's one of those things that when you go home, you're still the nerd you were when you left, and your parents still get to yell at you about cleaning up your room, and your girlfriend still drags you to the pet store.","I used to work in a record store. I'm kind of a record nerd.","Whatever notoriety Fall Out Boy used to have prevents me from having the ability to start over from the bottom again.","Touring on 'Folie' was like being the last act at the vaudeville show: We were rotten vegetable targets in clandestine hoods.","There's no amount of money that makes you feel better when people think of you as a joke or a hack or a failure or ugly or stupid or morally empty.","The song that's affected me the most profoundly is probably Michael Jackson's 'Thriller,' or, more specifically, the couple seconds of instrumental break before Vincent Price starts 'rapping.'","Written by the ancient Chinese philosopher of the same name, the 'Zhuangzi' is one long perplexing puzzle of a rambling collection of enigmatic short stories. It's a strange feeling to laugh at a joke written by someone in the 4th century B.C.","Between Prince and my dad's fusion-jazz records, I didn't have a choice in being funky.","'As Long As I Know I'm Getting Paid' is a satire. Lyrically, I want to be direct. With my history in Fall Out Boy, there's some expectation that I'm going to be lyrically obtuse. But that song is a straight-faced satire of consumerism.","I was going to record a solo album when I was 15 on a four-track. I started working on it, but then Fall Out Boy happened. The band was awesome and took me in a totally different direction. I don't regret it at all, but the band delayed the record I had been planning.","All of the agreed-upon pariahs throughout pop-culture history put their identities into the thing we decry. And yet we derive our own identities from the act of hating. We connect on the things we are disappointed in. Some may argue that nothing in history gathers a crowd like complaining about Lady Gaga's meat dress.","We're so busy broadcasting our latest cultural disdain that we scantly notice anything we enjoy. 'Oh man, this Rebecca Black kid is terrible! Let's laugh at her!' has become more culturally relevant than, 'I really love this new Bilal record.'","When you're No. 1 or No. 300, you still get to play and write the songs.","One of the things that always was Fall Out Boy was trying new things and kind of pushing ourselves in different directions.","In Fall Out Boy, I noticed that I wasn't putting all that much soul into it. It was just kind of screaming, I guess. I was just dying to get out of there!","In Fall Out Boy, we were all playing with our pop punk influences, so that was always within that kind of framework.","I never really ate that bad, I just ate too much. It wasn't like I had to switch to whole wheat bread or something like that. I really just had to eat less of what I was eating, and I had to exercise more.","Yoko Ono never deserved any of the hate she got. Paul McCartney and John Lennon weren't getting along.","Lyrically, I personally lean towards venting.","I wasn't necessarily frustrated in Fall Out Boy, but there were things that didn't get satisfied, desires left wanting. We didn't all meet on the same kind of music. When bands break up, there are all these buzz words that get tossed around to maintain a front for the audience, but in this case there literally were creative differences.","I am genuinely into soul, R&B and hip hop - all these genres that get slapped under the 'soul' genre. That spoke to me more than it did to my punk-rock friends. And punk spoke more to me than it did to my soul friends. I basically didn't fit comfortably in either world.","Drums were my first instrument, my first love. I need rhythm, something that moves.","Gym Class is a band I am more directly involved with than any other band except for Fall Out Boy.","I think when you're 17 and you're angry, you're angry about very short-term things. And there's nothing wrong about writing that record. It's a very real record to write; it's the realest record I could write when I was 17. The problem is, when you're 28, it's not the same thing; it can be a put-on.","I don't like to Google myself. I try and avoid it whenever I can.","For some people, home is family and their mom's house or their girl or whatever, and I have those experiences as well, but the biggest thing for me is Chicago.","Steven Tyler isn't in Aerosmith anymore, but his gravestone will probably say something about Aerosmith.","I didn't want to give up my Illinois driver's license and was unaware that was a crime. It is, by the way, in the state of California. Lesson learned. I technically broke a law, so technically I deserve whatever I get.","When I eat something like vegetable bibimbap, I get that warm and fuzzy feeling of eating stuff that I grew up with.","I definitely love kimchi. The biggest influence that eating so much Korean food growing up had on me was that I have no limit for spiciness. The hotter the better.","I moved to L.A. and really didn't dig living there until I found places like Koreatown and Little Tokyo. I really like hanging out in the grocery stores and restaurants."],"Patrick Swayze":["You know, I am a Leo. Lion is a giant part of me.","Good-looking people turn me off. Myself included.","What winning is to me is not giving up, is no matter what's thrown at me, I can take it. And I can keep going.","I keep my heart and my soul and my spirit open to miracles.","The way to screw up somebody's life is to give them what they want.","I don't know how many hills and valleys I've had, how many times I've had to refocus my world and my life and my career.","I keep dreaming of a future, a future with a long and healthy life, not lived in the shadow of cancer but in the light.","The longer your life goes on, the more death you face.","When it looks like I may live longer than five minutes I'll drop cigarettes like a hot potato.","I like to believe that I've got a lot of guardian warriors sittin' on my shoulder including my dad.","I'm trying to shut up and let my angels speak to me and tell me what I'm supposed to do.","How do you nurture a positive attitude when all the statistics say you're a dead man? You go to work.","If I leave this Earth, I want to leave this Earth just knowing I've tried to give something back and tried to do something worthwhile with myself.","What's powerful about a love scene is not seeing the act. It's seeing the passion, the need, the desire, the caring, the fear.","I've never been one to run from a challenge.","I don't know what's on the other side.","Sometimes a movie encapsulates a period or a moment in all of our lives in such a way that it never dies.","You can imagine me as a kid growing up in redneck Texas with ballet shoes, tucking the violin under my arm. I had to fight my way up.","I got completely fed up with that Hollywood blockbuster mentality. I couldn't take it seriously any longer.","There are people who want me to do a cologne. They want to call it 'Patrick.' I was offered a fortune to make exercise videos. Posters, all kinds of stuff - something like $10 million worth. It's insanity. I'm not going to do any of it.","If you live through the initial stage of fame and get past it, and remember thats not who you are. If you live past that, then you have a hope of maybe learning how to spell the word artist.","You can't be pregnant in leotards, and this is the last chance for us to get our bodies into the shape of concert dancers and capture it with the magic of film.","There's just something about dance. It's like a primal thing in all of us.","When people are away from home, they do things they might not normally do.","One thing I'm not going to do is chase staying alive. You spend so much time chasing staying alive, you won't live.","I just love to work hard.","I had a lot of anger because I wasn't happy with the way I had been raised.","I took after my father.","Together we can make a world where cancer no longer means living with fear, without hope, or worse.","As always, I appreciate all the love and support people have sent and continue to send my way.","I wanna live.","My work... is my legacy.","I don't want to be Mr. Romantic Leading Man. I don't want to be the Dance Dude. I don't want to be the Action Guy. If I had to do any one of those all my life, it'd drive me crazy.","I don't want to be a poster child for cancer.","I will go so far as to say probably smoking had something to do with my pancreatic cancer.","I dropped about 20 pounds in the blink of an eye. And then when you see it in the mirror, when all of a sudden you pull your eyes down, and the bottom of your eyes go yellow and jaundice sets in - then you know something's wrong.","It just blows me away that I am on, I don't know what generation of fans.","If I'm going to do television, I wanted that 'North and South' experience. I wanted something that's going to challenge me on a constant basis.","To be honest, I've made a game out of trying to live through my James Dean, Janis Joplin, Freddie Prinze, Jim Morrison period, those demons that we all have that we're either successful or not at making work for us rather than destroy us.","I am very, very clear on how difficult it is for a young kid out there to go into the arts without taking a lot of heat from his peers.","When you are a pit bull, and you love what you do and you are going to continue to grow, that talent will find its way out.","Talent deserves to be honored. Hands deserve to be slapped if you do something stupid as well, but don't take it too far.","Everything is designed to help you sell out.","I've had so many injuries."],"Patrick Troughton":["I believed totally in the possibilities implied in the series. I never thought of it as fantasy. Far from it.","I think space will be conquered through the mind rather than the clumsy medium of space travel.","I've played so many different parts in the last 40 years.","It seems so long ago that I played the part of the Doctor."],"Patrick Wang":["I admire people who have that integrity, who know how to peacefully move through a situation - and it's reflected in how they deal with things like loss.","If you think about people's lives, you think about what's significant. And the things I find significant in my life are not the moments when people are yelling at each other. They're the moments when someone says something that is very poignant, but oftentimes not loud.","Parts of the world can be very hostile to differences, social or artistic.","I've written a screenplay that is a series of monologues and songs; they form this sort of human tapestry across time and place. The form is strange, but I find it really fascinating.","I kind of treat myself like the audience. I don't like being lectured.","When I was in high school, I was lucky enough to be an exchange student to a small town in Argentina called Goya."],"Patrick Warburton":["The greatest risk is really to take no risk at all. You've got to go out there, jump off the cliff, and take chances.","Tick is a cartoon character, I don't know if you're familiar with him. This is the third step in his evolution. Comic book to cartoon to, now, live-action.","I do believe that we have the opportunity to continue - I repeat myself over and over again with this - to redefine and reinvent ourselves and as long as we do that, then I think we've got some pretty good odds in our favor, because we're not always presenting the same thing.","You never know what's going to happen with television these days.","You don't make a fortune doing cartoons. It's a lot of fun, it keeps you busy, and it's better than a kick in the pants, absolutely. But doing voiceover work doesn't make you rich. It just doesn't.","There's not a fortune to be made doing voiceover work unless you're one of the main voices on The Simpsons. See, there's The Simpsons, and then there's everything else.","So, deadpan I think just means not acknowledging for one second that you think that this is funny and clever.","Never met Levinson. Ever. He directed those American Express spots for us for Seinfeld, and I was off on some guest spot that I didn't even want to do... and I got talked into doing it.","My only job as an actor is to try and understand the character and, to the best of my ability, bring this character to life.","Let an audience be able to find it themselves without spoonfeeding it.","I've actually become much, much dumber through being married and having these children. I find that I'm not half as sharp that I once was. I can't even help them with their 4th and 5th grade vocabulary and math work at this point.","I'll work with Jerry Seinfeld any day of the week. Get a nice little paycheck there, but you do it for free. It's just good to be associated with that man. He's a great guy.","I thought he was an interesting central figure, central character, one who is definitely not your typical central character figure in a film, who's easy to like. He's not easy to like. It forces you to involve yourself with what's going on.","I love westerns. I've always wanted to do a western.","I have heard nothing from my friends at The Family Guy. Yeah, I heard that they got picked up again and all that good stuff, but I haven't heard anything yet. But, you know, I'm very elusive and hard to contact.","I have a family to support. And I'm not always going to be doing exactly what I want to do.","I don't know if I ever really considered making a connection with the audience.","I believe I'm doing the right thing in trying to step away from that and to take chances and work on little independent films and do stuff like that wild dance scene.","I always wanted to do a Disney movie.","He'd never seen Seinfeld, so he didn't know who Puddy was or anything.","Apparently I work for free, look at some of the independent films I've done.","All I try to do is as earnestly and as acutely as I can, conceive a character and try to portray this character just honestly. If the humor is within the absurdity and the awfulness of situations, then let it be seen that way."],"Patrick White":["I think it is impossible to explain faith. It is like trying to explain air, which one cannot do by dividing it into its component parts and labeling them scientifically. It must be breathed to be understood.","As a result of the asthma I was sent to school in the country, and only visited Sydney for brief, violently asthmatic sojourns on my way to a house we owned in the Blue Mountains.","My father and mother were second cousins, though they did not meet till shortly before their marriage.","When I was rising eighteen I persuaded my parents to let me return to Australia and at least see whether I could adapt myself to life on the land before going up to Cambridge.","Even if a university should turn out to be another version of a school, I had decided I could lose myself afterwards as an anonymous particle of the London I already loved.","Probably induced by the asthma, I started reading and writing early on, my literary efforts from the age of about nine running chiefly to poetry and plays.","In spite of holidays when I was free to visit London theatres and explore the countryside, I spent four very miserable years as a colonial at an English school.","I developed the habit of writing novels behind a closed door, or at my uncle's, on the dining table.","In fact I enjoyed every minute of my life at King's, especially the discovery of French and German literature.","I continued writing the bad plays which fortunately nobody would produce, just as no one did me the unkindness of publishing my early novels.","I left for New York expecting to repeat my success, only to be turned down by almost every publisher in that city, till the Viking Press, my American publishers of a lifetime, thought of taking me on.","Then about 1951 I began writing again, painfully, a novel I called in the beginning A Life Sentence on Earth, but which developed into The Tree of Man."],"Patrick Whitesell":["We've got to be proactive. It's my job to look for unconventional situations that achieve what my clients want.","With the world changing fast, we needed capital for investments. There's only so much bandwidth in your own balance sheet.","Red Interactive, the digital advertising agency, is a real, systemic kind of business, as opposed to a one-off thing. We can help advertisers frustrated by old media find clients they can work with.","We're in the service business by nature, but when we can transition that into ownership things, we love it. Our clients love it, too. We get deluged with offers to get involved with this or that. Silver Lake helps us funnel those opportunities.","I'm on Facebook anonymously. I wanted to see how people use it, what's going on there, but I personally didn't want to be on it because everybody in the world tries to get to you with scripts.","If you look at professional baseball in New York, you can get all 162 Yankee games on television anytime you want. But people still go to the ballpark because they are two different experiences. It's the same with film.","I'm from Iowa Falls, Iowa. My dad was a small-town lawyer, and my mom was a pharmacist. She worked at Swartz Drug. I have five older brothers.","When you live in a small town like Iowa Falls, there's not a lot to do, so we would, as a family, watch a ton of films.","I started at an agency called Intertalent. You copy scripts, you pick up people's dry cleaning, you take their dogs to the vet, you deliver packages, you do whatever they want you to do.","We're in conversations with brands worldwide for a variety of artists every day.","If brands can find a voice that matches them, and the artist embraces it, they can find a way that would serve them that doesn't feel like a sellout to the artists and has dramatic impact for the brand.","TV is still the place to grab the most eyeballs.","I don't think Hollywood will be the place that innovates great technology, but if people underestimate how they monetize content, they're sorely mistaken.","I think media people know we're good at making content and how we can be smart about how to consume it. It's always a balance.","We saw simply distribution was changing, content, premium content, premium stars; we're going to be able to do more in the world as it evolves.","There's no question there needs to be higher-paying opportunities for women. It's not that it hasn't existed in certain categories: Certain women have made a lot of money... Jennifer Lawrence... is being paid a lot of money, rightfully so, for the franchises she's in.","If you're a young actor, unless you're on a very short list at the studios, we have to be very creative about moving your career along. Otherwise, all we can do is hope to get lucky and find that perfect role that pops you into stardom.","Fifteen- to 30-year-olds are interested in all kinds of intelligent movies - it doesn't have to be a broad comedy or an action adventure for them to go see it.","Usually when you get a script from actors, you don't have high expectations.","It's almost an impossible thing to get a movie made that is written by two actors who want to star in it, when no one knows who they are. The only time it happened that I know of was when Sylvester Stallone did it in 'Rocky.'","In Hollywood, there's a network of creative executives, and when they hear something is good, it catches fire."],"Patrick Wilson":["I love to go to casinos with my wife. I play poker, and she's an old-fashioned slot queen. She even has a visor.","The thing about abs is if you hit them daily, you feel more put-together.","A heroic nature is very Greek.","I try to shave at night so my skin has a chance to settle by the early morning call-time.","I'm an early-morning owl.","You're defined by your older brothers' or sisters' music.","You don't ever see a thriller with a spiritual backbone.","When you're playing the good guy, you want to find the dirty parts - and when you're playing the bad guy, you want to find the vulnerability.","The great thing about doing theater is that you get to do it better the next night.","In a normal movie, you'd never see one guy talk for an entire page, whether good or bad.","With actors like Steve McQueen, Paul Newman and Harrison Ford, what made them such icons is that even in dramatic movies, their characters had a sense of humor.","I don't like being lied to.","I was convinced in middle school that I invented tight-rolling your pants, because I would get hand-me-downs from my brothers, and of course they were bell-bottoms from the '70s. So I would fold and fold over the bells. I like to think I started the trend. But I didn't.","There's just a natural instinct to want to be great, I think.","For everybody that does something bad there's gotta be someone that does something good.","If I ever get looks on the street, which, for the record, is almost never, it's rarely because they think I'm someone they saw in a movie. More often someone sees me and thinks, 'Hey, was that guy my waiter the other night?'","I think your teenage years define your musical roots forever. You're always looking for a theme for your high school years.","If I'm not going to get a part, tell me why.","When I look at a character, whether he's good or bad, one scene or 10 scenes, I just have to find my way in.","There are a lot of Christian fundamentalists; there are a lot of Muslim extremists. Every religion - Mormonism - has something way on the side that's completely using the religion as some weird backbone for their twisted faith. It has nothing to do with their religion.","If somebody wants to go to church because they like the ritual of it and want to sit in silence for a while one time a week, then that's great. If someone wants to go because they believe that God them and Jesus rose after three days, then that's great, too.","If you look back on the breakups that you've had, whether it's a long relationship or a one-night stand, it's always awkward.","You know when you see those guys and their sideburns are just a little too high? You don't need to have sideburns, but don't have to have them right above the ear. I knew a guy that did that in high school and I was like, 'What are you doing? Just let them down a little.'","For me, I always have to establish a reality for the character. In very actor-y terms, you just have to understand his reality.","I just don't watch a lot of TV.","Nobody ever wants to really make someone feel bad.","I love acting.","There's such an immediate intimacy with film that you just don't get in theater.","I'm an actor who wants to do great parts, and I've been very fortunate, for a long time, to get meaty roles, and sometimes some of them are meatier than others.","Yeah, I'm a spiritual person.","I grew up in the South and went to church a lot.","I am fascinated with religion or things that people believe in and question that. I think it's interesting.","I don't know if I have any feelings about psychics. I never really met any.","It's very hard to maintain focus in the gym.","My father is an anchor and my brother is as well.","I try to do as many different roles as the system will allow me. That's the benefit of not being in a giant blockbuster where you're the lead and you get typecast in that kind of role. I am able to slip in or out of a lot of different parts.","I love making movies, but there's nothing like being in front of an audience.","Emasculation does seem to be a theme in the roles that I choose.","I am an avid runner, mainly on weekends.","Musical theater is one of my passions.","I like it when my wife is in her jeans, with very little makeup. But, I also appreciate the range - the different ways she can look. The moment she walks out all dressed up and... whoa! That's always good.","The way you deal with a scare is the way you deal with a laugh. The timing has to be perfect. When you're dealing with fear or laughter - emotions that happen spontaneously - you hope it's working. But in the moment, you really have no idea."],"Patrick deWitt":["I've been surprised at how much an unknown like myself can accomplish just by reaching out to people and pleading my case. Quotes for the book cover, reviews and interviews, readings and radio appearances - all this by simply moving ahead and making contact with folks I thought might enjoy the writing.","I think of myself as somebody who, in a moment-to-moment way, I'm quite happy. But I think I am a bit doubtful and wary of true happiness, and, like a lot of my friends, there's been a good degree of self-sabotage.","I don't necessarily want to make people stomp and clap. I simply want to engage people.","When you're 8 years old, and you've become subconsciously familiar with the layout and design of Black Sparrow books, and you know the difference between Miles Davis and John Coltrane, something is bound to stick.","I was reading my son some fables; it made for good nighttime reading. These stories were very vivid and very strange and occasionally bizarrely violent. It was a very free landscape.","Love is dangerous; it's not something to be trifled with. As good as it feels on the way in, it feels that much worse on the way out.","I am a bit prudish, I think. It's hard for me to write about sex, and I don't really care to read about it, either.","Looking around, I saw so many unhappy adults, people who loathed their jobs, and I didn't want to be one of them.","Certain writers look down their noses at plot, and I think I might have been one of them until I tried it.","I come by writing dialogue fairly naturally, I've got a chatty family; I'm a bit of a voyeur, and if I'm ever in a public place, I automatically find myself listening.","The question of likability is a bit of a puzzler for me. You know, I don't write people with likability in mind. It's more whether or not I find them compelling.","I don't know that happy people are interesting to write about - or to read about.","I don't know that I'd call myself an optimist.","My interest in words and literature is always changing. And every day of work is different, and it doesn't feel laborious in the way that, say, washing dishes did. I'm quite happy to be doing what I'm doing, and I feel very lucky.","The hardest thing in the world for a writer is to amass a readership. So many good books come out, and so many good books disappear.","I am a homebody, something that lends itself to my profession.","The question about my Canadianness comes up a lot, and I'm never quite sure what to say about it. I've carved a life out for myself in Oregon, and it feels like home, not because it's the States but because that's where my friends are and where my son is.","I wrote for so many years in a bubble, the way everyone does, and there were large swaths of time where you think you're doing this for nothing. An audience is crucial, a back and forth with the invisible readers.","I have a paranoia that 'Ablutions' is the best thing I'll ever do.","I was intentionally curbing the impulse to be funny and hiding the ability. I wrote any number of very serious attempts at poems, short stories, novels - horrible. At a certain point, I recognized that it was fun to write dialogue that had a degree of lightness and humor.","Some deeper part of me wants to write comical dialogue; I'd be foolish to not follow that impulse. Now I recognize that if there's energy to a section of work, you go where the energy is. It's a living thing, and you just follow it.","I'm either enjoying myself or I'm not. And if I'm not enjoying myself, something's gone terribly wrong.","When your protagonist bores you, you're in trouble.","One of the nice things about writing is you can take essentially painful things in your life and turn them into something that might be useful, or at least entertaining, to somebody else.","All of my close friends are emotional train wrecks. This is what makes our lives interesting - constantly doubting ourselves, worrying, wondering if we've made a mistake. Could we have done better? Are we good people? Are we bad people?","If you're not riddled with doubt, you've probably done something wrong.","The theme of luck comes up a lot. It's something I thought about before, why some people are lucky and some people aren't lucky. It seems like some people you meet can sort of cultivate luck, and I've always been fascinated by that.","It's healthy to have interests besides books.","The nice thing about writing at home is that it's almost as though I'm doing it already. I get out of bed thinking of my work, and I don't have to go anywhere to do it.","More and more, I find myself turning away from everything relating to contemporary society. I don't know how healthy it is, but I am creating a very private bubble that I live in.","I know a lot of people who use the Internet really wisely. It enriches their lives in some way.","I've fallen in love in my life a few times. It's the most exciting part of being alive - that I've experienced, anyway.","After 'The Sisters Brothers,' I tried to write a contemporary story dealing with an investment adviser in New York City who moves to Paris. I did all this research, but after about a year and any number of pages written, I was bored stiff.","Often the starting point for characters, for me, is finding a little, most minor detail, and I'll go from there.","I am increasingly unimpressed by works of art that require a college degree to understand. I think that art should be for everyone. And people should be moved by it.","Whenever we changed schools, we had to make a new set of friends. At the time, of course, I hated it. But looking back now, I'm really glad I did, because it forces independence on you.","The impetus for 'The Sisters Brothers' was it occurred to me that there was no neurosis in westerns, or there's a minimal amount of it.","By the time I left the bar, I was 30. I was a dishwasher. They call it a bar-back, but essentially, I washed dishes for a living. I had no high-school diploma, I had no agent, and my literary successes were non-existent... but it was the only thing I ever wanted to do, so I did feel trapped.","I had no plan to write a western novel, and when I realized it was happening, I was pretty surprised by it. But you have to go with what feels right.","I was halfway through a rough draft of 'The Sisters Brothers' when it came time to start the 'Terri' adaptation.","I haven't read hardly any Westerns, to tell you the truth.","My instinct is to write under the cloak of an opaque historical setting.","All the books I was reading as a teenager were about individuals having adventures. So I thought that was what writers were supposed to do: to go out on the road.","When you meet someone you love, whether or not they love you back, something occurs in you that makes you want to improve yourself.","After school, I got a job in a shop in Hollywood and shared an apartment with a friend. I promptly lost my job and got evicted from my apartment, and that happened several times.","As a reader I want to be present and entertained. I don't want to be taught lessons, and I don't want to be spoken down to. I want to be treated as a peer and to be made to feel welcome.","A lot of authors, judging by their list, will put anything out that they finish... That's the worst model I've heard of in my life. It's just idiotic. Why wouldn't you just wait for the good ones?","My first book didn't even have a Canadian publisher. And that upset me, because I so wanted a readership up there.","Bernie Madoff is probably more nuanced then I'm giving him credit for, but I just couldn't get under his skin.","Especially if you're endeavouring daily to write your own books, you read with a degree of - well, it's hard to forget you're a writer when you're reading.","Lies can be wonderful things, and when a lie is told artfully, if it's done with a degree of craftsmanship, I can't help but admire the liar.","I felt like love has been underrepresented - unironic love, just actually really falling in love.","I don't consider Los Angeles home anymore; ultimately, it was pretty negative, but I did spend my formative years in the Valley and all around L.A. proper. Through my teenage years and into my young adulthood, up until the age of 30, I spent a good amount of time there.","Humorous writing is often thought of as substandard in comparison to work with a more dramatic or tragic intent. I don't know what to say to this except that I disagree wholeheartedly.","I wouldn't want to write a biography of anyone. I'd feel too inhibited by the facts and too much pressure to do the subject's life justice.","Unfunny people should be locked up, the key tossed into a smelter.","Many's the dead author whose body of work has been marred by overzealous publishers or family members. If this happens to me, I vow to seek out the responsible parties and haunt them to the point of death.","The initial spark, your affection for the characters, all those things can disappear. It's a perilous thing.","The reason I like Portland is the idea of going to a supermarket and knowing there's no way to be recognized. L.A. is so social.","I've always felt so fortunate to have writing to turn to every day. I'm obsessed with it.","'The Sisters Brothers' has endeared so many prize juries because the Western format has more of a broad appeal and is familiar to readers.","I'm not an enormous proponent of plot as a reader. It's about other things; my reading has become specialized over the years.","'The Sisters Brothers' started out as a little bit of dialogue between these two men who became Eli and Charlie Sisters.","A lot of my favourite books - I should say, not much happens in the books! It's much more about the points of view of the author more than anything else.","The idea is this: It's important to upset one's work habits, to topple the cart for each project.","If I were to continue to work in an established mode, it stands to reason the work would be limited by this - that it would never surpass the prior work in quality.","I heard somewhere that whenever you write a book, people will ask you One Question about it over and over. And while I'm no expert in these matters, this is proving to be true. My first book dealt with a not-that-pleasant degenerate type, and the One Question was, 'Is this an autobiographical story?'","I carry a small spiral notebook with me at all times and have been doing this for many years. There's a shoe box in my closet filled with these notebooks, each riddled with notes and impressions, ideas, schemes, and soup recipes.","Working in a bar was a horrific idea for me.","I kept trying to write these books that were sort of outside of my realm, and I kept failing.","I haven't read a lot of Westerns. But I wrote a Western. The influences were all cinematic.","I'm never doing anything by rote. I'm only on thin ice, and I think that that's a good place to be. I feel like when you push yourself like that, the rewards can be pretty great.","At the age of seventeen, I decided I would spend my life writing fiction. I didn't know what this entailed, exactly - a room, I supposed. A room and books and paper and solitude.","Every industry has slack times, and everyone has bad days at work.","I understand the desire to write and read about the death of publishing. It's a perversely and universally appealing topic.","I've stopped reading about the death of books because it's wasteful and morbid and insulting to the authors, agents, publishers, booksellers, critics, and readers that keep the world community of fiction interesting.","I've got a publicist at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt who's been working little miracles for me, but it's true the budgets aren't what they once were in terms of advertisement and book tours."],"Patsy Cline":["It seems that every time I stick my neck out, I get my foot into something else.","If I made a list of the people I admire, Mom would probably fill up half of it. She could do anything and everything.","Boys, they can't take my refrigerator now. They'll never get my car now. I paid cash for 'em and they're mine, and I'm keepin' 'em!","My new house is going to have wall-to-wall awards!","I've become a captive of my own ambitions.","I'm gonna walk a little bit of dog.","I'm gonna be something one of these days.","I recorded a song called, I Fall to Pieces, and I was in a car wreck. Now I'm worried because I have a brand-new record, and it's called Crazy!","You're gonna have to learn to get out there in front of those cameras and hold your head up. Take charge when you're singing.","The one thing I wanted to do more than anything else was sing country music.","Sitting around the house playing the wife and mother is driving me crazy.","In childhood I developed a serious throat infection, and my heart stopped beating. I recovered from that illness with a voice that boomed forth like Kate Smith's!","I'm not making up my mind about anything right now. Things are happening so quickly for me, and I'm still in the thinking stage.","I'm not gonna ride home in the car. I'll wait for Randy. I think I'll get home quicker.","I'm having surgery today to have my face cleaned up. But it will take some fancy stitching to make me all beautiful again!","I'm at that point again where it don't matter where he is to me anymore.","I'd like to do my first record I ever made, A Church, a Courtroom, and Then Goodbye.","I would never have gone anywhere if it hadn't been for Mother's faith and support.","I played with Arthur Godfrey for about a year and a half.","I have gotten more than I asked for. All that I ever wanted was to hear my voice on record and have a song among the Top 20.","I got me a hit record and I ain't never made a cent from it.","I can't miss a night's work and let my public down.","Carnegie Hall was real fabulous, but you know, it ain't as big as the Grand Ole Opry.","Anybody that'll stand up to The Cline is all right."],"Patsy Kelly":["In 40-odd years in show business, some years I could do no wrong, and some years I could do nothing right. Show business. I owe it everything - it owes me nothing.","I'll be a flop in movies. Besides, I don't like 'em, and I never did believe there was a place called Hollywood. Somebody made it up!"],"Patsy Kensit":["I am a survivor and not a victim. Life isn't perfect. When you get a knock, you have to get up, dust yourself down and get on with it.","Once a child is confronted with the concept of death there's a certain innocence that goes.","Everything in life is a lesson and I have learned from each marriage. Yes, I've made mistakes but every experience is a learning curve.","I am actually really boring and I lead a quiet life. I love being at home, cooking for my boys, watching movies and I like nothing better than to go to bed early with a book.","I always carry prayer cards to St. Jude and St. Martha with me.","When something bad is written about me, I find it hurtful. So I choose not to look at it.","If you're in love with someone maybe you can show it too much.","My mum worked as a secretary for Christian Dior. She looked like a movie star.","I most want to be remembered for being as great a mother to James and Lennon as my mum was to me and my brother Jamie.","I've only ever chosen men who happen to spend a lot of time out of the country, who have jobs that take them all over the world, and I think that's interesting because my father was absent, and then home, and I've always been in relationships where there's separation.","I'm happy to be at home with the kids, in my flannel pajamas; that's a treat.","I'm Catholic and Mum taught me the comfort that you can get from going to church. But I'm an a la carte Catholic. I love all the pomp and ceremony of it.","Dad was the first man I fell in love with. He was a very funny man. He grew up in the East End of London and was very dynamic, and I understood why my mother fell in love with him.","I am a happy person and I choose to be a positive person. I think some people think my life has been tragic and there have been these horrible dramas but things really have been, and are, fine.","Life is never going to be perfect, as much as we want it to be, and I have to lead by example.","Up until the age of 30 I could eat whatever I wanted - I mean, literally, I never put on a pound; if anything, I was criticised in the media for being too skinny.","I think that we can often be eating and not even really acknowledging that we are putting something about our mouths. I think there is lot to be said about eating dinner and not having the distraction of the TV."],"Patti Davis":["It takes strength to make your way through grief, to grab hold of life and let it pull you forward.","That is your legacy on this Earth when you leave this Earth: how many hearts you touched.","It's one thing to show your love for someone when everything is going fine and life is smooth. But when the 'in sickness and in health' part kicks in and sickness does enter your lives, you're tested. Your resilience is tested.","I'm part of the tribe who have said goodbye to one parent and are feeling a sense of responsibility for the one who remains - in my case, my mother. How do I make her time smoother, happier? How do I try to ease her, a widow, away from the dark well of grief without dishonoring the necessity of that grief?","I felt that the best I could do for my father, and the best I could do for myself, and my mother and my family was to stay open to the experience, and learn whatever I could at every step of the way as it was going on.","Some people, when they die, leave so much life behind that we wonder how they did it.","Puppies, like all babies, grow up fast. Before long, Gracie was no longer barking at her reflection, instead offering a blase look that seemed to say, 'I know what that is now. I know it's not another dog.'","The thing about losing any loved one, I think, particularly in a long disease, is that you know that other people have gone through it and are going through it, but I think for every person it feels unique.","I needed to run away in order to come home.","I'm not the angry, rebellious child that I was. You can remain a child for a long time. I certainly did. I was a slow learner.","Christopher Reeve understood that... everything begins with hope. His vision of walking again, his belief that he would be able to in his lifetime, towered over his broken body.","I had this odd sibling rivalry with America.","It used to be a lot easier to get a book deal.","When my father, Ronald Reagan, was running for president in 1980, my mother, Nancy, traveled with him on the campaign trail, but she did not give speeches or even many interviews. She never stood in front of a group of reporters and expounded on her views and opinions.","To me, Ann Romney sounds like a better candidate than her husband. She put her MS into remission through horseback riding, alternative therapies, and a healthy diet. She knows how to pace herself. She has a sense of humor and an innate honesty, and her hair moves in the wind. Maybe she should run.","And as far as false hope, there is no such thing. There is only hope or the absence of hope-nothing else.","I did what most writers do when something happens that's overwhelming, fascinating, moving, all of that. I didn't know what else to do about it except write about it.","The memories stayed with him for so long, and stayed vivid. And it didn't matter to me that he'd already repeated that before. I could hear it forever.","My father started growing very quiet as Alzheimer's started claiming more of him. The early stages of Alzheimer's are the hardest because that person is aware that they're losing awareness. And I think that that's why my father started growing more and more quiet.","After September 11, I got to understand a little bit of his deep love for this country.","America had taken my father from me. And over most of the years of his illness, I gradually started feeling this support system from this country who-people grieving along with us.","You know, if you hang around this earth long enough you really see how things come full circle.","Laura Bush went on national television during the week of my father's funeral and spoke out against embryonic stem cell research, pointing out that where Alzheimer's is concerned, we don't have proof that stem-cell treatment would be effective.","Even if the Bush Administration had flung open the gates to stem-cell research years ago, we would not be at the point of offering treatment today. Christopher Reeve would still have been taken from us. But we would be closer.","I was such a punk.","Politics isn't what defines a person, and it shouldn't define a relationship. I made the mistake of letting that intrude on my relationships.","It's a tender and complicated dance, watching our parents age. We become protective in ways we never were before, and we study them with a mix of sadness and curiosity: Is this what we will be like when we are their age? We tell ourselves to be patient - just answer the same question again as if it wasn't answered a moment ago.","When I was a child, our summer days were spent swimming; chlorine in my hair was like perfume to me.","I really just wanted to be a writer, but people tell you, 'You should have a backup career,' so I thought, 'OK, I'll act.' That was the foolishness of my vision for my life - that my backup career would be completely undependable.","I think people ultimately reveal themselves to everybody. I think that's the case with Sarah Palin's conduct, particularly after the Tucson shooting, I think she's sort of digging herself into a hole. I hope - I really hope.","I think that my father would find it so confusing that people want to imitate him. Not because he didn't have confidence in who he was, but because he never imitated anybody. He was his own person.","My father would never have said about any of his children you shouldn't express your opinions. But it's the way in which you express them. And for me to do - to speak at demonstrations and be as strident as I was now I see wasn't right. And it - there was a better way to do it. I could have written articles.","You have to separate yourself from your parents. You do. In order to find yourself.","I think the earlier stages of Alzheimer's are the hardest. Particularly because the person knows that they are losing awareness. They're aware that they're losing awareness, and you see them struggling.","I grew up in this era where your parents' friends were all called aunt and uncle. And then I had an aunt and an aunt. We saw them on holidays and other times. We never talked about it, but I just understood that they were a couple.","Just think: people decided one day that a day should be set aside for motherhood and fatherhood. What a great concept that is.","I have a feeling of reverence about my father being in his 80s - a feeling that I want to whisper, take soft steps, not intrude too much. He's like a stately old cathedral to me now.","The memories that I have are mostly at our old ranch, out in Agoura. We used to go out there every Saturday. I can smell the oak trees. I can see it so clearly.","I really just sat down to write. I mean, I did what most writers do when something happens that's overwhelming, fascinating, moving, all of that.","My father started growing very quiet as Alzheimer's started claiming more of him. The early stages of Alzheimer's are the hardest because that person is aware that they're losing awareness. And I think that that's why my father started growing more and more quiet. I think he felt, 'I don't want to say something wrong.' That's my sense of it.","I think that nothing teaches you more about life than death and dying.","My father's body lies in a stone tomb high on a hill. People walk by, pause, think their own thoughts about him and move on, back to their own lives. I can never move on. He is everywhere.","I often imagine what it would be like if my father were still here to mark his 100th birthday, if Alzheimer's hadn't clawed away years, possibilities, hopes. What would he think of all the commemorations and celebrations?","The CIA created, armed and financed the Contras. My father backed them with everything he had. It was my father's war, and almost everyone in Nicaragua has lost somebody as a result of it. I couldn't go down there, being his daughter, and expect not to feel those people's wrath.","I think we can work through a lot of political and international problems, but what really frightens me is what's happening environmentally.","I can't even consider the prospect of grandchildren because I don't know if there will be anything left for them on Earth. That's how serious the problem is. We can't drink the water or breathe the air, and we're all dying from some sort of cancer. How many generations can sustain that? It frightens me terribly.","We do things in our past that we need to do at the time.","The most ethical way to deal with an unethical situation would be to simply say: 'We did something wrong.' But nobody in a family like mine would ever respond like this.","I don't think it's an accident who our parents are; I believe we choose them. So maybe I chose my parents in order to effect change.","I'm very comfortable writing in the first person; it dives into the character in a way that's difficult if you're writing in the third person.","I knew people were independently publishing, and I buy books on Amazon. I began seriously considering it when Amanda Hocking was in the news about her self-publishing success.","Of course, people say maybe there are some self-published books out there that shouldn't be out there. Well, it's the same with conventional publishing.","Commerce is abusive. It's very hobbling to always be saying, 'Please let me put this out, this thing I've worked on for years.' It's like a nasty parent saying, 'No! Now go to your room.' As publishing companies got bigger, you felt even less significant.","My father, for his part, was not a man to begrudge anyone a divergent opinion; he'd have been fine if I had written some articles disagreeing with his policies, or even given interviews, as long as I was respectful and civil.","Decades later I would look into my father's eyes and try to reach past the murkiness of Alzheimer's with my words, my apology, hoping that in his heart he heard me and understood.","No one ever saw all of him. It took me nearly four decades to allow my father his shadows, his reserve, to sit silently with him and not clamor for something more.","I don't know why Alzheimer's was allowed to steal so much of my father before releasing him into the arms of death. But I know that at his last moment, when he opened his eyes, eyes that had not opened for many, many days, and looked at my mother, he showed us that neither disease nor death can conquer love.","I would not call myself a veteran conspiracy theorist. Or an obsessed one. I pretty much peaked on the whole conspiracy theory thing in the '60s, with the grassy knoll, who really killed JFK, and who ordered the hit on Lee Harvey Oswald.","I certainly support anyone's prerogative to hire or not hire whomever they choose, and I definitely don't want to work for someone who doesn't want me.","September 11 either made me love this country or it made me realize how much I already did. I think it's the latter. Seeing \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" made me think deeply about love of country - how it molds us, drives and emboldens us and how it can sometimes make us so angry, we want to shout out to the world: 'No, this is wrong.'","The house I grew up in had large plate-glass windows, which birds frequently crashed into headfirst. My father helped me assemble a bird hospital, consisting of a few shoe boxes, some old rags, and tiny dishes for water and food.","There is a version of Alzheimer's which is early onset Alzheimer's. And it's - it's horrible, because people do get it in their 50s and 60s. And it's terrible.","There is a point in the grieving process when you can run away from memories or walk straight toward them.","Loss teaches you to figure things out as they come along.","Texas governor Rick Perry's wife, Anita, has come out slugging in her glittering leopard-print jacket against what she sees as the unfair treatment of her husband. She tearfully said that he has been 'brutalized' for his faith.","Callista Gingrich has, I suspect, given Newt's advisers a giant headache. She's a constant presence at her husband's side - and a constant reminder of his acknowledged infidelity. Newt cheated on his second wife with Callista, a woman 23 years his junior."],"Patti Hansen":["Everyone thinks I'm this jock of a woman, but I didn't play any sports. I didn't even let my kids play baseball because I was afraid they were going to get hit by balls.","I loved when my boyfriends would call me their Amazon girl.","I never wanted to disappoint my family at all.","I don't want to write a book; I don't want to go on T.V., because I stink at it. The only thing I have always been comfortable with is being in magazines.","I never wore flats: The higher the shoe, the better."],"Patti LaBelle":["All I can tell you really is if you get to the point where someone is telling you that you are not great or not good enough, just follow your heart and don't let anybody crush your dream.","You don't have to be an angel, just be someone who can give.","So if diva means giving your best, then yes, I guess I am a diva.","I've had 60 years of ups and downs, and all of the downs that I've had, I'm happy that I've had them because it's taught me to appreciate all the ups.","So if anybody wants to get me something, get me 60 crabs - one for each year. I don't want no diamonds, I don't want no shoes, I don't want no party. I want some crabs.","I was a shy kid with a broom handle that I pretended was a microphone.","I don't feel as though I have to prove anything to anybody.","People with no humor, they're outta my life.","I want to be remembered as a woman who was fair and always gave 150 percent, no matter what I did.","Women are strong now. Women are dominating the charts, and women are doing it for themselves. We're kicking butt and taking no prisoners.","Women are dominating the charts, and women are doing it for themselves. We're kicking butt and taking no prisoners.","You've got to know business before you go to show business.","I truly respect the people who are working. If they want an autograph from Patti LaBelle, they are going to get it. I have never separated myself from them. I never think you are better than the next one.","I never wanted to go on stage alone because if you mess up, who can you blame?","I know how to put it on when it comes to interviews and performing because I have to. But I'm pretty laid back.","I've been shut down, run down, talked about, dogged out, but that never stopped me from the being the true me that's here and will be here.","I clean my house, although I have help. I'm on the floor getting spots. I can't stand a dirty house. I'm a cleaning fanatic.","I'm 60, and I did 60-year-old women songs. I'm not trying to be the Hip-Hop Queen, although I am the original Hip Hop Queen.","I keep showing decade after decade that I am a real performer.","I'm no different than you.","I'm very spontaneous.","I love Canadians because I don't see very much racism in Canada.","When I look into the crowd, I see young and old, black and white - it's amazing that I'm able to connect with so many different kinds of people.","I never thought I would be singing for the world.","I just sing the stuff that makes me smile, makes me feel like I didn't sell myself out.","I can't do some of the songs that younger girls like Mary J. Blige and Beyonce are doing. They have their own place and I have my own place.","I was very shy. I'm still shy.","I'm very shy in a crowd.","A diva is someone who is a perfectionist, who does her best in her craft.","I have to go 150 percent or nothing at all.","I'll perform all the way to the grave.","I decided to always sing in the back with the chorus and never went up front because I had trouble performing.","I think the race situation is getting better as far as people respecting each other goes. I think the race situation with entertainment is not that much better.","I'm still standing up there tall and strong every night that I perform.","I like hip-hop music, but some of the lyrics make me want to cry.","Whenever I go out, so many people who respect me ask me what to do in a certain situation. A lot of times, I didn't know the answers because sometimes I was going through the same sort of thing. But then later on, I would think of things that people told me.","I'm so grounded, it's sad.","When I was married, I wasn't loving myself. Now I'm in love with myself. I will get married again.","I don't tweet, Twitter, email, Facebook, look book, no kind of book. I have a land line phone at my home - that's the only phone I have. If my phone rang every day like everyone else around me, I would lose my mind."],"Patti LuPone":["Smile at a stranger. See what happens.","It's not easy being an actor, and having said that, everybody's an actor. Do you know what I mean? Paris Hilton's an actor, which is kind of scary. But if you want to honor your craft and yourself, strive for the nobler instincts.","A show is exhausting when it stinks. It's exhausting when you have to work overtime to make something work.","I'll tell you what I think in general about people who want to make their Broadway debut that are not trained stage actors. Don't they know, Broadway ain't for sissies? It is a tough gig. You are responsible, physically, mentally, emotionally, for eight shows a week, at the top of your game. It's not easy.","I knew when I was a kid that I had a Broadway voice. I wanted to be a rocker, because I grew up in that era of transistor radios at the beach.","The word diva to me means doing something supernatural with something natural.","I played the tuba in high school. I wanted to be a member of the marching band. I thought, what can I play that has the most effect? What can I play to get people to laugh?","I think Madonna is a wonderful performer.","We're not show-business people. We have a life.","I love what I do, and I love the audience, and I love the fact that I get to do it, and I love, I love our craft very, very, much, and it's a noble craft. We have a responsibility to it, and to the audience, and to the playwright, and to the message. I won't ever care less.","I don't listen to the contemporary pop artists. They all sound alike, anyway.","I know what it means to have a leading part, and I know what it means to have a featured part.","Nothing has ever come easy for me.","Anybody that goes to the theater, I think we're all misfits, so we ended up on stage or in the audience.","I'm totally Italian, but I'm not a diva. If you could see the way I'm dressed in daily life, that's not a diva. Appearances are so not important to me.","A well-rounded performer will listen to all kinds of music. I like classical, Middle Eastern, and rock a lot.","The theater is a tough place. It's not cushioned the way it is in film and television.","To be nominated was enough, but when I won I the Tony I just felt relief.","New York seems to be thriving, which I'm grateful for. But I would hope that they would figure out how to negotiate the traffic and limit the pedicabs, because it seems to me that it's becoming a more chaotic city.","In America, it stands out, because it's raw, it's big, it's emotional. My face is raw, big and emotional. It didn't work for the longest time.","What's the difference in opening from scratch in Philly or opening from scratch in New York? The old out-of-town tryout circuit - taking the show pre-Broadway to cities like Boston, New Haven, Philadelphia, Washington - has sort of been replaced with the amount of workshops we do.","I just create, that's what I do.","I just love chickens.","I learned a long time ago from David Mamet to wipe your feet at the door, get it out on stage and then go about your life.","I am in musical theatre, but it isn't necessarily what I listen to in my leisure time, do you know what I mean?","I think that Stevie Nicks is one of the greats. Steve Nicks and Grace Slick and Janis Joplin have the real rock voices, to me.","The only thing we are as actors are messengers. That's all we are. Correct? We are delivering the playwright's intention through the concept of the director. And I come on stage; if I feel confident in the role, then I give it away.","All my career, I've said this: Critics and producers think audiences want actors that only present the silhouette and hit the points in the silhouette. What I do is too dangerous.","My favorite band was The Band, and nobody compares in my mind with The Band.","My favorite composers are the ones that tell the story. I love Wagner. I love Mahler. Prokofiev. The programmatic music. I listen more to classic rock because I don't like the contemporary music very much.","Let me say I was trained at Juilliard. I have a very high standard. I expect everybody around me to work equally as hard because people pay a lot of money for tickets. They demand the best that we have.","I wish I could have a recurring role on 'Modern Family'. I think 'Modern Family' is the best comedy on television. It's extremely well written, extremely well acted and directed.","The book 'A Reliable Wife' is a slice of American history. It takes a part of American history and tells a story about the purchase of a wife by a Wisconsin businessman. The research of that would have been really interesting.","I'd love to do situation comedy - it's the best job in show business.","I'm sure there are actors out there who work with other actors on a consistent basis - I am not one of them."],"Patti Page":["I was a kid from Oklahoma who never wanted to be a singer, but was told I could sing. And things snowballed.","Your voice dries up if you don't use it.","I think that one of Elvis' charms was that he could sing almost any kind of music. I am sure that in his heart, which I don't know what was there, but just from his singing I could feel that he was very partial to gospel music.","What I like about singing is that, for me, it's a substitute for the psychiatrist's couch.","My music was called plastic, antiseptic, placid.","A lot of the music, and especially rap, I don't understand.","On the radio I listen to the easy-listening stations, the jazz stations.","I always thought that Elvis could have been a great actor, and that he was put in a lot of unimportant movies when he could have done a lot of great ones.","Being able to sing all these years has helped me handle life's tragedies.","I'm sure there are a lot of things I should have done differently. But I don't think I've stepped on anyone along the way. If I have, I didn't mean to.","I can tell it all in song: pathos, gladness, love, joy, unhappiness.","Each song, you're telling a story and acting."],"Patti Scialfa":["With any long-term relationship, you have good days and bad days.","I did feel funny about being fair and having red hair and freckles. I did not like that because I grew up in a neighbourhood where no one had red hair. I felt very conspicuous but not in a nice way.","Forget the press - just being a partner of somebody who's very, very famous, it's hard to keep your center and your personality intact.","You drive past your old high school, and even if everybody treated you terribly, you still go take a look, don't you?","I like having the space of my own project.","When I was younger, I'd go to the Museum of Television and Radio in New York and watch this beautiful clip of Billie Holiday playing with a bassist, a pianist and Gerry Mulligan, who was a friend of mine, on baritone sax. At one point, she looks over at Gerry, and they just smile. When those moments happen, it's just lovely.","I grew up in an era where you had to find your own way as a woman. When I was a kid, there was this whole physical and emotional neatness and purity that a woman was supposed to have, and I didn't fit into that.","You know how you get close to something you want and then you start doing things to ensure that you don't quite get it? I did a lot of that.","I like writing a body of music that has a cohesive, emotional thread through it.","I was always friends with a lot of guys, maybe because their girlfriends were girly-girls, and they felt safe with me.","When you're married to someone famous, people know you, but they're not really seeing you.","People were a little leery when I was doing the press for my last album 'Rumble Doll,' yes. It's always that thing that this is a dilettante or a pet project.","I loved a lot of different kinds of music, but for my own thing, I went for the singer-songwriters.","We always make a hot breakfast for the kids: oatmeal, pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs, the whole deal. We like to have that time in the morning together as a family.","All my kids play guitar, sing, and dabble with writing.","There was such a lack of modern, recognizable role models for a young girl in the 1950s. I mean, 'Leave It to Beaver' didn't speak to me. That's why I latched on to music.","For writing, I get up early in the morning - 5 o'clock, 4:30. I'm a morning person... So I try to do it while people are asleep. The mornings are the nicest.","You come to the city, and you have a chance to find out who you really are.","My real priorities were my family - my kids and Bruce - and my work with the E Street Band.","I don't really sell many records.","I've been writing and making my own music for a long time."],"Patti Smith":["As I grew up, one of my strongest allies has been my sister.","To me, punk rock is the freedom to create, freedom to be successful, freedom to not be successful, freedom to be who you are. It's freedom.","Artists, musicians, scientists - if you have any kind of visionary aptitude, it's often something that you don't have a choice in. You have to do it.","In art and dream may you proceed with abandon. In life may you proceed with balance and stealth.","If I've learned one thing in life, it's not to be so judgmental of other people.","Grief starts to become indulgent, and it doesn't serve anyone, and it's painful. But if you transform it into remembrance, then you're magnifying the person you lost and also giving something of that person to other people, so they can experience something of that person.","If you feel good about who you are inside, it will radiate.","You can't change the world; you can't fix the whole environment. But you can recycle. You can turn the water off when you're brushing your teeth. You can do small things.","Some of us are born rebellious. Like Jean Genet or Arthur Rimbaud, I roam these mean streets like a villain, a vagabond, an outcast, scavenging for the scraps that may perchance plummet off humanity's dirty plates, though often sometimes taking a cab to a restaurant is more convenient.","I never felt oppressed because of my gender. When I'm writing a poem or drawing, I'm not a female; I'm an artist.","I've said this over and over, but I'll say it a million more times - I'm concerned more about the death of a bee than I am about terrorism. Because we're losing hives and bees by the millions because of such strong pesticides.","Nothing is a hobby - each discipline is its own world with its own high standards. Of course, every artist has 'minor works' that they do, but I don't think I have any 'minor disciplines.'","My mother had no end of tragedy in her life. She would make herself get up and take a deep breath and go out and do laundry. Hang up sheets.","My sunglasses are like my guitar.","Never let go of that fiery sadness called desire.","I just do my work, and I work every day, and my ambition is just to do something better than I last did.","Since I was a child, I hated having to deal with my hair. I hated having to change my clothes. As a kid, I had a sailor shirt and the same old corduroy pants, and that's what I wanted to wear everyday.","In 1974, when I started working with the material that became 'Horses,' a lot of our great voices had died. We'd lost Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison and Janis Joplin, and people like Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X.","My daughter is one of my greatest inspirations. She's an environmentalist, she plays piano, she's raising money for the earthquake victims in Nepal. Every day she surprises me and teaches me something.","The Bible is very resonant. It has everything: creation, betrayal, lust, poetry, prophecy, sacrifice. All great things are in the Bible, and all great writers have drawn from it and more than people realise, whether Shakespeare, Herman Melville or Bob Dylan.","I'm a worker. I do the work to communicate, and I want people to embrace it, and when they do I'm happy.","The thing I've always liked about performing is that I decide what I want to wear, whether I want to comb my hair.","I was born in 1946, so I was born on the tail end of when everything was deemed important. You made things to last. If you came from a poor family, there was only one can opener.","My mission is to stay healthy and productive and serve as a good example.","I'm not afraid of terrorism at all. I'm afraid of loss of our freedom, loss of mobility, loss of global comradeship.","The idea of redemption is always good news, even if it means sacrifice or some difficult times.","My style says, 'Look at me, don't look at me.'","I think I'm constantly in a state of adjustment.","Even as a child, I knew what I didn't want. I didn't want to wear red lipstick.","I've always believed in having a sense of balance and stealth.","Polaroid by its nature makes you frugal. You walk around with maybe two packs of film in your pocket. You have 20 shots, so each shot is a world.","All I've ever wanted, since I was a child, was to do something wonderful.","An artist is somebody who enters into competition with God.","I come from a real working class background, and I didn't know anyone sophisticated - except I saw Edie Sedgewick once at the Art Museum in Philly. She had these black leotards and little black pumps and this big ermine cape and all these white dogs and black sunglasses and black eyes. She was classy!","I have great respect for my parents. I got such beautiful things from both of them. It doesn't mean that we didn't have our rough times, but they were remarkable people who were open-minded, creative and hard-working, and had great senses of humor.","Rock n' roll is dream soup, what's your brand?","It's not that I have compromised or anything, but it's always been important to me to take good care of myself and be a good example. I'm not much a role model in terms of hair care, though.","What I really like is an intelligent review. It doesn't have to be positive. A review that has some kind of insight, and sometimes people say something that's startling or is so poignant.","Since childhood, it was my dream to go where all the poets and artists had been. Rimbaud, Artaud, Brancusi, Camus, Picasso, Bresson, Goddard, Jeanne Moreau, Juliette Greco, everybody - Paris for me was a Mecca.","I come from a working-class family, and I've been working since I was 13, from babysitting to blueberry picking to factory work to bookstore work. And of course, being a mother and homemaker, the hardest work of all.","I don't think the area of Jerusalem should be part of a Jewish state; it belongs to all people, to Christians and Muslims and the Jewish people.","Well, I'm not one of those people who needs the limelight. If I'm performing, that's what I'm doing. If I'm not, I don't long for it. I don't need the approval of an audience, or applause.","For everything bad, there's a million really exciting things, whether it's someone puts out a really great book, there's a new movie, there's a new detective, the sky is unbelievably golden, or you have the best cup of coffee you ever had in your life.","I want to be around a really long time. I want to be a thorn in the side of everything as long as possible.","I dreamed of having a book of my own, of writing one that I could put on a shelf.","When I was a child, I was certain that I could remember what it was like to live on Venus; I could remember what it was like to live in the American Plains. I could remember. And it's ancient memory. We all have it. It's just that some of us access it more than others.","People have the power to redeem the work of fools.","An artist wears his work in place of wounds.","If I have any regrets, I could say that I'm sorry I wasn't a better writer or a better singer.","Everyone has a creative impulse, and has the right to create, and should.","I felt alien my whole life, but I didn't feel alien because of my gender. Other people made me aware of my gender.","I always enjoyed doing transgender songs.","Usually when I go to a place for the first time, unless there's something historical or spectacular that nature has to offer, the first thing I like to do is see what's on the minds of the people.","I came into music because I thought the presentation of poetry wasn't vibrant enough. So I merged improvised poetry with basic rock chords. That was my original mission.","When I was young, all I wanted was to write books and be an artist.","Bringing good news is imparting hope to one's fellow man. The idea of redemption is always good news, even if it means sacrifice or some difficult times.","A day doesn't go by where I don't create something.","I remember when the Bic pen was controversial. They came from France. They were cheap, and when one was out of ink, you threw it away; you didn't dip it into more ink.","Maybe I'll be 48 and die in the gutter in Paris.","From very early on in my childhood - four, five years old - I felt alien to the human race. I felt very comfortable with thinking I was from another planet, because I felt disconnected - I was very tall and skinny, and I didn't look like anybody else, I didn't even look like any member of my family.","The thing is that as you grow through life, the pursuit of art and the pursuit of new ideas, all these things keeps your mind elastic.","What I wanted to do in rock 'n roll was merge poetry with sonic scapes, and the two people who had contributed so much to that were Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison.","I loved books; I read my childhood away. I was more interested in my interior world.","Good news doesn't necessarily have to be a positive thing. Bringing good news is imparting hope to one's fellow man.","If I'm taking a picture of Brancusi's grave, I know that there's something of him, of his mortal remains, beneath my feet, and there's something beautiful about that.","I was never a singer; I can't play any instruments; I had no training. Plus, I was brought up in a time when all the great rock stars were male. I didn't have any template for what I was doing. I did what I did out of frustration and concern.","I loved being a rock and roll star, but it wasn't what I wanted in life.","We have such a great depth of human history in all of the arts, whether it's opera or mathematics or painting or classical music or jazz. There's so many things to study, new books to read, and certainly always ways to transform old ideas and to come up with new ones.","An artist may have burdens the ordinary citizen doesn't know, but the ordinary citizen has burdens that many artists never even touch.","First of all, anybody who has lasted 30 and went through the 60's is really a survivor.","I have a daughter who's 11 years old. Maybe she'll grow up independent and really really heavy and become a movie star and she'll play me in my life story.","Mohammed personally mapped out seven heavens. If he got to seven, you know there's more.","My mother answers all my fan mail.","As far as I'm concerned, being any gender is a drag.","When I stopped performing for 16 years and lived in Michigan and was married and raising my children, I wrote about four or five books. I haven't published them. I just haven't gotten around to it for several reasons.","The issue of gender was never my biggest concern; my biggest concern was doing good work. When the feminist movement really got going, I wasn't an active part of it because I was more concerned with my own mental pursuits.","As an artist, I used to think that my responsibility was to do good work. But I had to learn from the '70s on that being a public figure presents another aspect of responsibility.","My parents had three kids right after the Second World War, and we were all sort of sickly. Then I had a fourth sibling, with very serious asthma. The medical bills... So my parents always struggled.","I personally am not interested in people trying to pigeonhole me.","One of my great goals when I first started taking photographs or showing them publicly is that people might want one for over their desk. That's my goal.","What a model of an artist was for me was an artist who worked. Picasso was the ultimate model, because the work ethic he had.","My mom loved rock n' roll. My father hated it. We couldn't play it when he was around. He liked classical music and Duke Ellington.","The thing is that any sophistication I have, aesthetically, comes from 'Vogue' and 'Harper's Bazaar.' In the '60s, I never missed an issue, even if I had to steal to get them.","I didn't love Jim Morrison 'cause he was self-destructive. I loved him because of his work. Because of the way he merged poetry and rock-and-roll. Because he did something new.","I love playing the Fillmore. I love the walk from the hotel and climbing up those old, iron stairs that lead to the stage. I imagine Jerry Garcia, Jimi Hendrix and the Doors and all those other great bands climbing those same stairs.","I like revisiting my early work, and people like to hear it. I don't make people suffer through any experimentation or new material. When I go see an artist, I want to hear the songs that drew me to them, so I do the same.","I get irritated with the world. I get irritated with politicians. I get very irritated with governments and with corporations, but in terms of imagination - my imagination is always fertile. I'm either thinking of my own things or constantly engaged by the things that other people do.","I'm not really a musician. I'm a performer, and I love rock n' roll. I've embraced rock n' roll because it encompasses all the things I'm interested in: poetry, revolution, sexuality, political activism - all of these things can be found in rock n' roll.","It was always my belief that rock and roll belonged in the hands of the people, not rock stars.","What I say should always be prefaced with this: I'm not really politically articulate. I just try to be like Thomas Paine: what is common sense? So when I say these things to you, I am speaking from a humanist point of view. I just look around and see what's wrong.","People called me the godmother of punk, but I never name myself anything.","It's no secret - I love detective fiction. One of the reasons I love being in London is because I like to watch all the shows on TV. I watch them all. I like 'Detective Frost.'","You can't carve up the world. It's not a pie.","Americans just don't know what being a movie star's all about.","Artists are traditionally resistant to labels.","Besides me wanting to be an artist, I wanted to be a movie star.","Christianity made us think there's one heaven.","Everyone thinks of God as a man - you can't help it - Santa Claus was a man, therefore God has to be a man.","Horses pretty much broke as a record in England.","I had a really happy childhood - my siblings were great, my mother was very fanciful, and I loved to read. But there was always financial strife.","I like gettin' old.","I never thought I was gonna live to 30.","I've always thrived on the encouragement of others.","In fact, I thought my calling was to be a painter.","In the period where I had to live the life of a citizen - a life where, like everybody else, I did tons of laundry and cleaned toilet bowls, changed hundreds of diapers and nursed children - I learned a lot.","Let's just say that I think any person who aspires, presumes, or feels the calling to be an artist has a built-in sense of duty.","No, my work does not reflect my sexual preferences, it reflects the fact that I feel total freedom as an artist.","Somehow I started introducing writing into my drawings, and after a time, the language took over and I started getting very involved with the handwriting and then the look of the handwriting.","The new artists coming through were very materialistic and Hollywood, not so engaged in communication.","Then I read Little Women, and of course, like a lot of really young girls, I was very taken with Jo - Jo being the writer and the misfit.","When I was younger, I felt it was my duty to wake people up. I thought poetry was asleep. I thought rock 'n' roll was asleep.","Those who have suffered understand suffering and therefore extend their hand.","Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine.","I had to learn, really, how to rein in my energies and discipline myself. And I found it very very useful. I rebelled against it at first, but it's a good thing to have.","I wrote every day. I don't think I could have written 'Just Kids' had I not spent all of the 80s developing my craft as a writer.","I wanted to go to Portland because it's a really good book town.","I've written a lot of prose. I just haven't published it.","A lot of children don't have a developed aesthetic. I did. I made early choices in life, even about cloth; I liked flannel and not polyester.","My father's mother was from Liverpool and she had this very beautiful English china. I only wanted to drink my cocoa out of my grandmother's cup and saucer.","I don't think the Palestinian people or Afghan children or some other things I'm concerned about are at the top of other people's agendas - not right now, when America is going through such a recession and people are suffering across the board financially. But I think all that will change.","My mom loved rock 'n roll. My father hated it. We couldn't play it when he was around.","I'm not saying I wasn't flawed or amateurish. But you can never say I did anything to appease the music business.","I'm an intuitive musician. I have no real technical skills. I can only play six chords on the guitar.","I know I'm a strong performer. I'm not an evolved musician.","I am not really certain how original my contribution to music is as I am obviously an amateur.","I've always looked the same. Since I was a child, I hated having to deal with my hair. I hated having to change my clothes. As a kid, I had a sailor shirt and the same old corduroy pants, and that's what I wanted to wear everyday.","C'mon, I mean who didn't listen to 'The Who' in the 60s?","Sure I destroyed my guitar at every concert, but it was okay, because I'd always get a shiny new one the very next day.","We tried not to age, but time had its rage.","A lot of my audience are in their 50s. But they want me to pretend to continue to be pretending.","Sometimes you're doing really well, then, after three or four years, everything inexplicably crashes like a house of cards and you have to rebuild it. It's not like you get to a point where you're all right for the rest of your life.","I was so unhealthy as a child, and at least three or four times my parents were told to get ready, that I would not make it.","More than anything, that's been the thread through my life - the desire to write, the impulse to write. I mean, it's taken me other places, but it was the impulse to write that led me to singing.","I learned a lot from Arthur Rimbaud. People talk about how he wanted to be a seer and do that through the derangement of the senses. What they forget was that he also advocated, sternly and austerely, that one must be able to go through all that - and then articulate it.","I had a handful of records, but when I was 11 years old, I liked Puccini as much as Little Richard. They both made sense to me.","I'm not a very analytical person.","Why do people want to know exactly who I am? Am I a poet? Am I this or that? I've always made people wary. First they called me a rock poet. Then I was a poet that dabbled in rock. Then I was a rock person who dabbled in art.","The thing is, it's not uncool to worry about people who seem like they're going on the wrong path. There's nothing cool about being self-destructive.","When I was young, I knew William Burroughs really well. And William's secret desire, which he never quite did, was to write a straightforward detective novel.","I'd just make sure with anything I say I know what I'm talking about.","If I feel any marginalisation, it's because the things that concern me aren't so important to other people.","Ornette Coleman is a real musician. He takes all of the things he's thinking about in the world - which is a whole universe upon universe - and translates this into music.","I've lost lots of men in my life, besides my mother, which is a whole different loss.","I would rather write or record something great and have it overlooked than do mediocre work and have it be popular.","I don't stay in one discipline because it's more lucrative than another. In fact, the most successful thing I ever did was 'Just Kids,' for which I had absolutely no expectations.","For Christmas every year, my mother used to give me those cheap little diaries that would tell your horoscope and provide a little blank slot for each day.","People came at me with all sorts of offers, wanting to make me into a hard-core Cher. I had no desire for any amount of money to be reformed for someone's vision, because in the end, that's what you got: your clay in someone else's hands.","My mother and father had so many ups and downs and stayed with each other and helped each other. My mother took in ironing and she was a waitress. My father was working in the factory and he did people's tax returns.","My parents were very well read. They were both New Englanders, not highly educated, but they had a sophisticated... they were both very humanistic, and they were sophisticated readers.","I didn't know Kurt Cobain or Amy Winehouse, but I was affected by both of their deaths because I admired their work so much and mourned their youth and work they would never produce.","I don't think public life in and of itself can destroy you. I think it's the way people react to it, and some people are more sturdy than others... I don't think any one faction can be blamed for a person's self destruction - a certain amount of that has to be innate.","I always wanted to be an artist, writer and poet since I was seven, and one has to live long enough to evolve as an artist and do one's finest work.","There are so many great 19th-century photographers, and it's really my favorite period, but the amateurs did such beautiful work.","If your label won't let you have the cover you want or sing the songs you want, then leave!","I didn't begin my life in 1975 with 'Horses.' I recorded 'Horses' in 1975, but was drawing in Paris in 1969.","Hopefully if you create something fine, people will relate to it, so you're communicating with people, and you're not in a void. On the other hand, because you're always creating and transforming, art always separates you - always.","People wouldn't know this about me, but I adore ball gowns. I love their cut, their architecture and the thought of the hands of so many seamstresses working on them.","Music television is all about the media-oriented version of what it is to be a rock star; it's not about what Bob Dylan or Jimi Hendrix were about - which included great images, sure, but they had spiritual and political and revolutionary content, too.","It was no hardship to me to spend long hours reading and writing.","The moment of creative impulse is what an artist gives you. You look at a Pollock, and it can't give you the tools to do a painting like that yourself, but in doing the work, Pollock shares with you the moment of creative impulse that drove him to do that work.","My father was a dreamy fellow - he read Plato and Socrates and watched Phillies games.","I was raised in rural south Jersey, and there was no culture there. There was a small library, and that was it. There was nothing else.","Truthfully, I don't really think of myself as a photographer. I don't have all the disciplines and knowledge of a person who's spent their life devoted to photography.","The reason we did 'Land of a Thousand Dances' and 'Gloria' on 'Horses' was because I liked repetitious, three-chord rock songs, but I didn't understand that I could write my own. I didn't realize that you could use those chords a million times.","I was a lower middle-class kid. My family had no money. There was no room in our small house where there were already four kids, including myself, living.","When I was a young girl, I'd love giving book reports.","I was in musical comedy. And I did very well, but the memorization killed me. I'm not good at memorizing, and it gave me a lot of anxiety. I hated the makeup. I hated all that pancake makeup. I didn't really like dressing for parts.","I liked being on stage; I just didn't like the theatrical aspect of being in front of people.","Pop music has always been about the mainstream and what appeals to the public.","I have bigger concerns than what pop stars are doing. I'm more concerned about our environment, what industrialists are doing to it.","When I was young, I was offered my first recording contract in 1971 and was offered quite a bit of money if I would change my character and be a '70s version of Cher.","No matter what anybody thinks about any of them, every record I've done has been done with the same amount of care, anguish, pain, suffering, and joy.","We never threw a record together. Each record was done really seriously, as if our life depended on it.","I haven't had the most thrilling lifestyle. I was a pretty good dresser, but I would have a pretty boring 'Behind the Music.'","I'm always writing. And, I mean, I always counsel people when they call me a musician: I really do not have the skills of a musician. I really don't think like a musician, though I love music and I perform and sing.","When I'm writing a book, I don't have any responsibility to anyone. I'm solitary. I'm writing on my own. I write by hand. And I write every day. I mean, it's part of my daily discipline.","Robert Mapplethorpe asked me to write our story the day before he died. I had never written a book of nonfiction, and so it took me almost two decades to write that book.","Robert Mapplethorpe, I met in 1967. He was a student at Pratt, though even as a student a fully formed artist. We went through many things in our life together. He became my loved one, then my best friend.","I don't believe people playing rock n' roll should have crowns. We're not kings and queens. Anybody can play it.","I'm a human being, I'm a friend, I'm a mom, I'm a writer, and I'm an artist. I do play electric guitar and all of that, but in the end, I'm just a person.","I knew William Burroughs really well, and I was always star struck being around him. I adored him.","I've always felt outside of things; I've always felt different.","Nothing will stifle your human evolution more than fame and fortune.","When I did 'Horses,' I never expected to make another album.","'M Train' is as close to knowing what I'm like as anything. I don't know exactly what the book is about. All and nothing, I suppose.","I know what that tastes like, to be a rock-and-roll star - to have a limousine, to have girls screaming when they see you, girls trying to cut my hair, get a piece of me. But I don't walk around with a concept of myself as a rock-and-roll star, and certainly not as a musician, because I really can't play anything, except primitively.","I'm not part of any movement; I don't like being fettered.","As a citizen, hopefully I'm humanist. As an artist, I'm free.","My siblings were a bit younger than me, and I was always entertaining them and making up stories.","I was raised Jehovah's Witness. I was in Bible school at five or six years old, but I wouldn't say that we were a religious family.","I was quite an insomniac. I rarely slept as a child. Having God to talk to at night was nice.","My son and daughter lost their father quite young, so we keep him present with us. It's just a daily practice.","I was a sickly child, not very strong physically. I wasn't really the greatest in school. I didn't really excel in anything particularly. But I was happy with who I was.","Throughout my life, I happily deferred to family, companions, children.","I have a lot of energy, and I like to work.","As I go through life, I can see why my mother directed me that way, or why my father counseled me in that way. But some things you're open to when you're young, and some things you need to find out for yourself. I think that that's pretty universal.","I think we have a creative impulse where suffering can magnify our work, but so can joy. You can be in love and write the greatest love song ever. Sometimes I think too much suffering makes it difficult to do one's work.","I try not to give too much advice, really, because people have to do their things their way. I got lots of advice when I was young, and I ignored most of it - the good and the bad.","I had this idea that the coolest thing that could happen to you was talking with God. My father was always talking about God, and I idolized my father, so I'd spend hours trying to have mental telepathy with God.","You're not a rock n' roll person four hours a day or even when you're on stage. It's become the rhythm of your whole life.","The cult of celebrity in the '60s and '70s was really more reserved for movie stars or high socialites. Paparazzi didn't care about Janis Joplin.","New York is a great city. There is no question of that. It's such a diverse city. I've walked down the city and heard four or five different languages simultaneously. I think that's beautiful.","There is hardly a place in New York that you can't walk a block and a half and get a cup of coffee. Believe me, I've been all over the world. There's no place like that but New York City.","What I wanted in life always was to write something as good as 'Pinocchio.' I wanted to write. I wanted to evolve. I wanted to grow.","In the '60s, I used to love rock magazines; I'd cut out pictures of Bob Dylan and John Lennon.","We didn't have the phrase 'style icon' when I was young, but I have to say, I really copied Bob Dylan when I was younger: a little bit of Bob Dylan or a lot of Bob Dylan and the French symbolist poets - I liked how they dressed - and Catholic school boys.","I like really hot coffee, not too strong.","I get up, and if I feel out of sorts, I'll do some exercises, I'll feed my cat, then I go get my coffee, take a notebook, and write for a couple of hours.","I know that some people have different personas for the different things they do, and I'm not criticizing that - maybe it's a good thing - but I'm the same old person, so I take everything in stride.","It's not uncool to worry about people who seem like they're going on the wrong path. There's nothing cool about being self-destructive.","I voted for Obama. I was very happy when he won. But Obama hasn't really been able to effectively do anything that has made me... He hasn't helped the environment. He didn't close Guantanamo Bay. He went deeper into Afghanistan.","It's taken me other places, but it was the impulse to write that led me to singing. I'm not a musician. I never thought of performing in a rock n' roll band. I was just drawn in. It was like being called to duty - I was called to duty, and I did my duty as best as I could.","I always wrote. I wrote every day. I don't think I could have written 'Just Kids' had I not spent all of the '80s developing my craft as a writer.","I had a penchant myself for doing several things at once. I wanted to draw, write, speak.","I work to Glenn Gould in the morning and go to sleep listening to Parsifal.","I am still a very optimistic person. I continue to do work with joy.","I was studying Francis of Assisi for quite some time, when Benedict was still the pope. And I was studying it for a song that I did for my last album, 'Banga.'","I sang 'O Holy Night' with the Vatican orchestra, but also a Blake - a lullaby that William Blake wrote for the Christ child, and I set it to music, and the Vatican orchestra played the music.","I remember the first club we played in San Francisco. There were a lot of people on motorcycles standing around outside, and I had trouble getting in. I didn't have any ID, and the guy at the door wouldn't let me in, even though I told him I was gonna be singing in there.","Of course, every artist has 'minor works' that they do, but I don't think I have any 'minor disciplines.' Each discipline I approach as a major undertaking that I put my whole self into.","I was actually born in Chicago, and then when I was a toddler, my parents moved to Philadelphia.","My dad got a job in a factory in Philadelphia, so I was raised in Germantown in a sort of a barracks for soldiers. They had housing for temporary housing. And then my parents saved money and bought a little house in South Jersey, built on a swamp.","My parents were very humanistic, but where we lived was not the cultural center of the world. Hardly. So I came to New York for two reasons: to find my own kin and also to get a job. And that's what I came to New York for in '67.","The only thing I daydreamed about was being an opera singer. But I was so skinny and so pathetic that that sort of wasn't going to happen.","I don't believe any artist who says, 'I had to do that because DJs will tell me I can't play that music. I will lose my job.' Well, lose the job and create a new job. If your label won't let you have the cover you want or sing the songs you want, then leave!"],"Patti Stanger":["If you're giving love and not receiving it, you're not in the right relationship. If you're receiving it and not giving it than you are taking advantage of the other person.","I dated a guy and he liked me but I didn't like him. I went through his wardrobe and cleaned out his house and got him to get a new car. He said to me, 'If I give you $10,000, will you find me my wife because I want someone like you?' And within a year, he got married. That was the first match that led to me leaving my corporate job.","When you know what the male species is looking for - 'I'm not into a redhead,' 'I don't want a fat chick,' - I have to tell them that X won't date you unless you're this. I'm just the messenger.","Taylor Swift dates guys so she can write a breakup song about them. I don't think she's dating for love - I think she's dating for creativity. So let's get her off the market and put her in dating detox. If she really wants love, she has to stop writing music about them.","On both 'The Bachelor' and 'The Bachelorette,' it seems like proposing marriage is equivalent to saying, 'Let's date.' Everyone knows those aren't the same things.","I think the men in L.A. are very rugged, good-looking. Men in New York look metro with their manis and pedis and their Bruno Magli loafers, but inside they're very masculine - aside from the Meatpacking District. The problem is the men in New York are five to one: five women to one man.","For the women in California, they're just downtrodden because they're so gorgeous here. Every hot cheerleader comes to California to make it. The men don't want to get married, they're lazy lions. Matthew McConaughey is their poster boy so they can procreate and live on the beach in the trailer and have kids and have money and be hedonistic.","The best part about being a matchmaker is you are getting credits in heaven, as I really believe I work for God. The worst part is that matchmakers can often fix everyone up, all the way to the altar, but cannot find love themselves, so it is bittersweet.","To get rid of depression, I swim with dolphins.","I don't hate redheads! The millionaire men - wealthy men - never pick them. Every time I offer them they say no. I could say the most gorgeous redhead in the world and they'll say no, they don't want it. Now if you ask an Irish guy in Ireland, he says 'yes,' because that's indigenous to that country.","Up until age 40, most men are just not as mature as women. So, it makes sense that a lot of women date up in age a bit.","It's not hard to find a date if you are Jewish in New York and Miami, but its hard in Texas.","I'd like to adopt an older child, maybe 5 years old.","I have put gay dating on the map.","I'm an advocate for gay marriage. I have more gay friends than Carter has pills.","I'm recognizable in certain circles, like girls know me, couples know me. But not all straight men know me.","The rich are different. Their wants are very high maintenance. They'll pick eye color and hair color, all the way down to what she does for a living, what school she went to. Their list can be extremely long. But at the end of the day, dating is dating, because they're human beings.","It hit me really hard that I want kids in my life.","We're all getting plastic surgery. Come on, this is the game here, and HDTV exaggerates all the features. Yeah, I'm proud of it, because we're all doing it. Nobody's talking about it.","I was single for a really long time, then I realized I had abandonment issues. Then I found love online.","I really want to adopt a child... I want to be called 'Mom.' It really is the most beautiful word in the English language.","Gays don't have a lot of testosterone. I'm talking about that they use both sides of their brain. Straight men only use one side. Gay men are very bright, very handsome... they put themselves better together. They dress good, they decorate, they clean, they cook.","Women are smart in business and dumb in love. They won't date outside their zip code, let alone outside the city. They are city snobs.","There are a lot of millionairess situations. I'm one of them. I've always dated down financially. And now I'm changing my tune on that one. Things are going to change for me.","If I was in a situation where it wasn't working and I had a choice with another man, I'm gonna assess it like a business deal: who is the better person for me?","When a man gets cheated on, I'm like, 'Meh, he'll find somebody else.' When a woman gets cheated on, that's a deep wound. I think when a man is widowed, like Liam Neeson, I think that has more of an effect - you had a great love and the universe took her.","If you have been divorced once - male or female, but especially for females - and you're over 40 you're actually a commodity. It means you were able to commit once, and you'll do it again.","I had to find a diet that would kick me back into dating shape, because I know that I can't date at size 8. I have to date at size 2. And it's just a fact of nature. Go get your injections and your chemical peels. You gotta look good to attract a man.","I state in my book 'Become Your Own Matchmaker,' confidence is the key to any endeavor. Women don't realize that when they do things they love and are passionate about - their confidence soars. Men are attracted to women who feel happy and decisive about life.","As long as women are in the work force making their own money and decisions, men are going to have to realize that this way of life is here to stay - because it takes two incomes to make it and more now. The sooner you address your style of saving and spending with your mate the better off your relationship will be.","I always believe a woman should have 5 non-negotiables that she should stick to when attracting a mate. If the guy does not have these five major things - then she should not give the guy a chance as she's wasting her time. The rest is up to the magic and wiggle room the universe gives.","A man can be drawn across the room with the simplicity of a smile. That's why your pearly whites should always be straight and shiny. I think most of my clients are drawn to a fun, flirty nature in a woman. The problem is, most women do not often feel fun and flirty.","We go on dates thinking that person is our future husband or wife, without getting to know them, as we live in a fantasy and an illusion of romance.","I used to practice Wicca.","If I weren't a matchmaker, I'd be a chef.","I was a D student in high school and on the dean's list in college.","I'm a planner, and most networks don't plan. Bravo doesn't plan. Bravo is lucky in a lot of ways - they've got a lot of great talent, but at the same time, they don't nurture it. They lost 'Project Runway.'","There is no 100 percent pre-nup.","Men like to provide for women and their families. It's in their DNA. I'm obviously no scientist, but I bet if you could hear a Y-chromosome talk, it would say, 'I want to provide and hunt.' When the woman is the primary breadwinner, it's going against nature. I'm not saying that it's bad or wrong, I'm just saying that it can feel off.","If you're a successful woman, chances are that you spend a ton of time working. You're probably on your email a lot, taking phone calls and going on regular business trips that don't involve your man. He can start to feel left out of a very important and very time-consuming part of your life.","What I do know is that traditional gender roles are very real and flipping the norm is difficult for even the strongest, funniest, smartest men.","A ring means a commitment. But more than that, it means that you've talked about your shared future and have decided together on a shared vision of it.","If you're going to get engaged make sure you've talked to your partner about life together in the years to come.","We have all loved a guy we know has issues. Despite popular opinions, until we give it a final try, the relationship will always be in the 'what if' stage.","The only way you'll have a pen of potential Romeos from your past to choose from is to actually have a past.","A lot of Hollywood couples get married young and wind up growing out of their relationship.","It's not easy to date when you're hefty. Besides I like feeling thin because it makes me feel amorous.","My favorite splurge would be gluten-free pizza. Or I'm a total truffle addict so truffle mac and cheese.","I'm a dancer so anything related to dance I love to do. I also tried Zumba last week. That thing is tough! 15 minutes in I was going for a water break. It wasn't easy!","Think back to yourself at age 18. I know I was mighty different than the Patti I am today. As we grow up, we grow out of our haircuts, our apartments and - often times - our romantic decisions.","I'm a very stereotypical person... and that's part of my flavor, I guess, because I tell it like it is.","I probably should be a little more cautious with how I speak, and I think my delivery needs to be a little softer.","We've heard some theories, but there is a lot of mystery surrounding my adoption.","It's hard for women who make a lot of money and make decisions all day long, then they have to come home and be 'Stupid Sally.' Men need respect, and they need to know that they can lead in the relationship, so even if they don't make the most money they need to be able to call the shots.","I'm Jewish, I can say it. We're storytellers. We were the moneylenders... Therefore we tell great tales to get what we need. I love Jewish men. They make the best husbands.","Oprah didn't want to put me on the show for a really long time because she thought I was more for the men than for the women.","Valentine's Day is the hardest day of the year for a woman to get out, but everybody who is anybody and single is out that night.","I was a VP of marketing, I was regional sales manager in fashion, and marketing director in communications and product development. I was always a corporate Fortune 500 girl.","Successful men don't date up. They are intimidated by wealthy women unless they are blue bloods. Successful men want to always take care of their women, and that means financially.","I have a great track record, and I have never been sued. If I can't find someone for someone, I refer them out. I have an affiliate division of matchmakers all over the world that I work with. Men like certain types of women, and I can subcontract that out to foreign countries.","I'm very quiet and shy in my personal life, as hard as that is to believe.","I'd like to date another millionaire. I've never done that.","I'm on the Sensa diet. It's a little magic powder based on Dr. Hirsh's clinical trials and studies and it basically signals the brain that you're full through smellology.","I had a breast reduction."],"Pattie Boyd":["I love life. There's so much to learn and see all the time, and nothing nicer for me than to wake up, and the sky is blue.","I'm blessed with the fact that I'm a fighter. I've always known life was meant to be joyful.","I think men are mainly unfaithful because as they get older, they feel the urge to prove to themselves that they are still attractive. They need proof from outside the marriage. It's really sad. It's all about them. It's not about their wives at all.","I think there's a path cut for us, a destination mapped out. Everyone ends up where they're meant to be, and how they got there doesn't really matter.","Women hang onto the romanticism of a relationship. But a man compartmentalises it into the past and then gets on with his new life.","People blame the 1960s for just about everything these days, but it was the decade when all that post-war furtiveness and small-mindedness was finally blown open, and opportunity really came knocking.","It wasn't until I realised that I could actually take nice photographs that I started to become passionate about it. I then got a few jobs working for magazines in London, and I would get terribly excited and intense about doing a job and taking photographs and looking through the lens to capture something amazing.","I think modelling is a very difficult thing. It's glamorous and fun, but underneath it all, you know your flaws, and those are what you focus on.","I have led an exceptional life in some ways, yes. I mean, I've been very lucky. I seem to have had a gift for landing in the right place at the right time.","I'm one of these people who couldn't imagine the future. The future never occurred to me. I just loved life every day.","Men find it more difficult than women to be alone. They function better with someone in their lives. Being married, they are rooted, so they feel safe to go and do what they want to do.","I had never been allowed to go on tour with my husband George Harrison, so had no idea what to expect when I left him to join Eric Clapton on his 1974 U.S. tour.","Once I've taken photographs, I look at them, and I get into them, and I'm there for the moment - and then that's it. I find little time for reflection.","It was great fun to hang around the Beatles. They had amazingly fast minds, and they were incredibly amusing and funny and witty. They were great. There was a very high energy surrounding them.","I think I lost my sense of identity when I was married. I know I did. And it took me a very long time to regain it and find out who I was.","During my childhood, I felt older than my years because I felt responsible for my brothers and sisters.","I feel very lucky that I was part of that whole scene in the '60s and '70s. I love looking at the photographs because everyone was young, and they were so gorgeous to look at.","I didn't have boyfriends until my late teens. I was at a girls' boarding school, and my stepfather disapproved of me going out with anybody. I never really came across any boys. When I did, one of them asked me out, and I was petrified. I felt like a fish out of water, and it was excruciating.","One grows up thinking you will naturally be able to have children, and when it doesn't happen, it's a shock. But I just feel that it wasn't meant to be.","It's such a joy to be able to have friendships free from worry. It's so lovely to live without fear.","People say it's cathartic to write a book, but it turned out to be quite painful!","I wasn't really terribly familiar with the Beatles when I met George. They were just emerging. They certainly weren't as big as they became later on. I just knew them as a pop group, and that's all. I was keener on George as a man and a person, as opposed to someone in a band.","I was a firm believer that if you get married, then that should be it. But it's sadly not always the case; sometimes people can't remain together for whatever reason.","I've been avoiding journalists my whole life.","I do have a right to talk about my life, to tell my truth from my perspective.","When you're married to somebody iconic, people tend to notice him.","I can't rewrite history.","I never wanted to be an actress. I didn't have any ambition in that area.","I loved everything that went with rock n' roll. I loved being at the heart of such creativity and being young in such a stimulating and exciting era."],"Pattie Maes":["I try to eat healthy, but being Belgian, I'm also addicted to chocolate.","I've been intrigued by this question of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense - a sense that would give us seamless access and easy access to meta-information or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help us make the right decision about whatever it is that we're coming across.","I am not one of those people who lives for work. I enjoy sculpting and photography and tennis and swimming. I simply do not have enough time. My life is not in control."],"Patton Oswalt":["The problem is, and I'm just as guilty of this, a lot of people see their follower count increase and mistake that for friendships. It's great to have followers, especially if you want to sell albums, promote shows, or promote your friends, but you still need to get outside and talk to other human beings.","You know, in Los Angeles, you're constantly in your car, you're sealed up, you're not walking around. Whereas in New York, after a while, all your stuff is kind of public, in one way or the other. I'm not saying either one of those is bad; they're both great for a very specific kind of comedian. And I'm glad that they both exist.","I fantasize and idealize myself as Bugs Bunny, but I know deep down I'm Daffy Duck.","There are times when I have to take, I call it a 'silence bath,' where I shut off all of the external gadgets. I go walk around, talk to people, and just live life for a while.","I'm still very much an atheist, except that I don't necessarily see religion as being a bad thing. So, that's a weird thing that I'm struggling with that seems to be offending both atheists and people that are religious.","So when you spot violence, or bigotry, or intolerance or fear or just garden-variety misogyny, hatred or ignorance, just look it in the eye and think, 'The good outnumber you, and we always will.'","We're rewarding either the reality or the appearance of youth, which is why you have all these people in their fifties trying to act like they're seventeen. You know, it's great to be young. Be young. By all means, be young. But always remember that youth is also kinda dumb, and doesn't know a lot yet.","I had a romance novel inside me, but I paid three sailors to beat it out if me with steel pipes.","Knock on wood, my groupies tend to be very artistic, creative people - sometimes way more creative than I am.","I have some shorter stories coming out in other books early next year. I might be pitching a re-vamp of Ghost Rider in the spring. We'll see.","If you hit a midget on the head with a stick, he turns into 40 gold coins.","Growing up, there are always those kids who are only happy when they are making someone else upset. That is unfortunately just how some people are. And their parents were fine. Some people are just born with bad wiring.","Lot of ugly funny dudes end up with some pretty gorgeous women. Women are much deeper than us in choosing a mate - they see in the long term.","Every audience is different, even within the same venue. You have to just make every audience your audience; you can't pre-judge an audience based on the size of the room or the type of room. You've just got to be in the moment and go with it.","I really had to imagine the kind of person that I would have been if I had never left my hometown. I don't think I would have been a very pleasant person.","It's like our country is being run by a bunch of bad alcoholic dads right now.","George Bush is not stupid. He's evil. OK? There's a huge difference between stupid and evil.","I have to drink this much to be as unfunny as you.","90% of every art form is garbage - dance and stand-up, painting and music. Focus on the 10% that's good, suck it up, and drive on.","I think I realized it was an art form at the beginning, but it took me a really long time before I was able to view what I was performing myself as an art form.","I think right now is the best time for stand-up, ever. I sincerely do.","I mean, the death in the late eighties and early nineties really shook out a lot of hacks. The pond just sort of dried up for a lot of really bad comedians.","Yeah, there were a few years in the early nineties where I really began to hate what was valued as funny and just sort of what was valued in stand-up, period.","I mean, all alternative comedy is are comedians that have being doing it for so long, for so long, that they were relaxed enough to start becoming personal on stage.","I hate all sidekicks.","I'm not familiar with the metric system.","I've hung out in the writer's room a few times, but the fact is we've got such a good writing staff, I don't want to get my peanut butter fingerprints on anything.","I remember, when 9/11 went down, my reaction was, 'Well, I've had it with humanity.' But I was wrong.","We would not be here if humanity were inherently evil. We'd have eaten ourselves alive long ago.","Based on my own experience, when you're going through adolescence you don't know how the world works. You can't set a story in the world you live in because you don't know what a utility bill is, or how to budget your paycheck.","As unhealthy as I am, I'm weirdly aware of exactly how my body functions.","I think the kind of person that gravitates toward New York is a person that's not so much focused on controlling exactly how they appear and how they exit. They're more fascinated with the process.","With acting, you see some of the kids are literally just off the street, untrained, and they are great. And others are off the street, untrained, and kind of horrible.","In my mind, I was always a comedian who was going to branch into writing.","All the truly great stand-ups say, 'I go onstage, and I work on jokes. The inspiration will happen while I'm doing my work.' To me, in the end, the surest thing is work.","Before doing my first open mic, I was sitting in the back watching all these comedians banter back and forth and fire jokes and up each other, and I thought, 'This is where I wanna be.'","To get asked to do stuff like 'United States Of Tara' and 'Caprica' is terrific. I can't complain.","There's nothing wrong with doing comedies, and I'm not against comedies, either, but I always want to do stuff that keeps me off my guard and gets me out of my comfort zone.","I'm going to continue to try to strike a balance, because I really, really do love doing stand-up, and I don't see why it should affect the acting.","I wish I had a really cool, esoteric answer, but what the process is to me is going onstage night after night after night after night until I get a new hour. And then once that hour is solidified and recorded, I move on.","One of my groupies gave me a film that they made, and it ended up being amazing, so I got it shown at South by Southwest. If I can help get their stuff out there, then great.","This sounds like a brag, but I know how to make good fried rice. I learned in college. There are two secrets - take the rice after you cook it and let it get cold in the fridge. Then cook the egg like you're making a fried egg and just before it's done, dump the rice and veg on it and swirl it around.","Every audience is different, even within the same venue. You have to just make every audience your audience; you can't pre-judge an audience based on the size of the room or the type of room.","I'm always trying out new stuff onstage. That's where I do all my writing.","If you actually do cold readings, it's very close to how people actually talk, because you're experiencing these thoughts anew every moment, and trying to make them come out coherently.","I have a very tiny house in Burbank. I drive an 8-year-old car. I'm gonna drive it into the ground. I enjoy what I enjoy.","Having enough money has to go hand in hand with living in a way that you're not being a slave to your possessions.","I like to write, I like to do stand-up, I like to act.","I know how my body operates differently from what it did when it was 30 and when it was 20. As unhealthy as I am, I'm weirdly aware of exactly how my body functions.","If I were to just focus on stand-up, I could actually, paradoxically enough, be home way more, because I would leave on a Friday, go do a couple theaters Friday, Saturday, maybe Sunday, come home.","Like, my feelings on religion are starting to morph. I'm still very much an atheist, except that I don't necessarily see religion as being a bad thing. So, that's a weird thing that I'm struggling with that seems to be offending both atheists and people that are religious.","When you act, you're being asked to pretend in a very rigid, controlled environment. It's very un-childlike. So a lot of times, when you put kids in that situation, you hope they have a better support system outside of what they're doing to bring them back to reality at the end of the day and to keep them well-rounded.","Now we live in this DVD, iTunes, Hulu age, and show creators and networks are realizing that and letting shows develop on those terms rather than 'We gotta just punch it week to week, man.' Now they're like, 'What will happen if someone watches the entire show?'","Doing 'Young Adult' was really reassuring to me in a lot of ways. It confirmed a lot of suspicions I had about great actors.","I haven't sworn off Facebook. I'm on Facebook. There's a fan page on Facebook that I will update, but I'm on there myself under a pseudonym, because there were a lot of people able to private-message me on Facebook, and it was getting really weird.","I don't want to get into extended conversations with people on MySpace, because there are friends I have extended conversations with every day.","The Kentucky Fried Chicken corporation made a bobble head of me and sent it to my management. No card, nothing.","Here's what I'm afraid of. I know a lot of comedians, friends of mine, who just got into the 'Doesn't matter what I say. It doesn't matter. They're just gonna laugh anyway.'","I've gotten very cynical and kind of anhedonic about all the things I have to do to get to do comedy: all the travel, hotels, and airports.","If you play comedic scenes like they're really serious, then it's so much more funny than if you're going for a laugh.","There's all kinds of those moments in your life where either through a weird set of circumstances, or a song you hear, or a smell you smell, or one person says something totally out of the context without the meaning that you assigned to it, but you snap back to the way you were when you were 14 or 15. We all deal with that.","When you put an album out, you can't do any material from the album if people are paying to see you.","As much as I know people love the method and what you can draw out of yourself, a lot of acting is very imaginative.","Beyond any role that I ever had, really early on as a stand-up, I would see actors decide to try it and they would bomb miserably. What I realized was that stand-up, acting and writing are all their own disciplines.","Any acting job that I ever got, I always treated it like I was a neophyte; I didn't know what I was doing, and I was going to work just as hard as I do on my stand-up.","As you get older as a comedian and keep doing it, what you actually start to cherish on stage is not the build-up to the jokes, but how comfortable you can be in the silence and the non-laughing parts, and how long you can take the audience without a laugh to then get a huge reaction.","What you want to worship above youth, I think, is beauty, and beauty is so beyond just appearances after a while. Because you can be with someone who's good-looking; if they open their mouths and they're an idiot, then they cease to be beautiful very quickly.","A lot of nerds aren't aware they're nerds. A geek has thrown his hands up to the universe and gone, 'I speak Klingon - who am I fooling? You win! I'm just gonna openly like what I like.' Geeks tend to be a little happier with themselves.","I look pretty nondescript. I don't go out of my way to... I don't express my personality with my clothes, with my car or my, you know, house. I express with my personality; so as far as what I wear - I don't really care about that.","Wars are usually really popular with people that aren't gonna be affected by them. 'Cause it's just entertainment, and it's just weird, like, 'Well, we've got to show the world that we're strong.' No we don't. And by the way, that has nothing to do with you. Why are you equating yourself with that... you know what I mean?","I've had some pretty good arguments with people, but I've never regretted it. I've had people come up where it's all emotion and no fact. That's always sad.","I never said that movies were struggling behind TV. I'm just saying that movies have a better creative cache.","If Kevin James or Paul Giamatti drop weight, I'm done. I don't want to be the last pudge out there.","I grew up in such a featureless, personality-less suburb. There was nothing to push against.","It wasn't until I went to college and met different people from different areas of life - and then went to San Francisco and met people who really knew who the hell they were - that I kind of caught up in a hurry.","There is a part of my generation that is not on social media because they have happy lives and they're not trying to connect with anybody. And there are other people who are on social media because they need to connect.","I can't say that I ever abided nerd stereotypes: I was never alone or felt outcast.","Everything we have today that's cool comes from someone wanting more of something they loved in the past. Action figures, videogames, superhero movies, iPods: All are continuations of a love that wanted more."],"Patty Berg":["What does it take to be a champion? Desire, dedication, determination, concentration and the will to win.","People are what this election is all about.","Always keep learning. It keeps you young.","It's not how fast you get there, but how long you stay.","It's a wonderful day for me, I made it to 80.","There is nothing in this game of golf that can't be improved upon if you practice."],"Patty Duke":["As much as I loathe this aging thing, I'm beginning to recognize that I am now a healthier person in terms of self-worth and knowing who I am and where I fit in the world. That's been a good trade-off for the wrinkles.","It's toughest to forgive ourselves. So it's probably best to start with other people. It's almost like peeling an onion. Layer by layer, forgiving others, you really do get to the point where you can forgive yourself.","We have developed this unbelievable ability to deny. We have to. If we didn't, we'd go crazy.","One of the reasons I survived as well as I did was my genetics. My mother and father both had very tough lives, and boy, were they survivors.","Nobody gets through life on a pass.","The mania started with insomnia and not eating and being driven, driven to find an apartment, driven to see everybody, driven to do New York, driven to never shut up.","I can't tell you what I had for breakfast, but I can sing every single word of rock and roll.","Reality is hard. It is no walk in the park, this thing called Life.","At the age of 19, I removed myself from society for almost four months, setting off years of manic episodes, including outrageous overspending. I bought several Mercedes because I thought I could. I had no money, but I rented a jet.","For the first time, I lived alone... in a luxury apartment on Sunset Strip. For a few days I loved the idea, but I got lonely and restless.","No amount of therapy will take care of a chemical imbalance of the brain.","Bipolar indicates that you're not - you don't just experience depression, but the mood swing goes up, and it can go very up.","I still have highs and lows, just like any other person. What's missing is the lack of control over the super highs, which became destructive, and the super lows, which are immediately destructive.","Actors take risks all the time. We put ourselves on the line. It is creative to be able to interpret someone's words and breathe life into them.","I joke around a lot about the manic times because they're funny. We manics do outrageous things and it is part of our colorful nature.","I'm going to be 58, and I'm a woman. In this business, that seems to be a bigger crime than being mentally ill.","No matter what your laundry list of requirements in choosing a mate, there has to be an element of good luck and good fortune and good timing.","I've survived. I've beaten my own bad system, and on some days, on most days, that feels like a miracle.","Human beings have speculated about the relationship between inspiration and insanity for centuries.","I believe that all the important people in my life prior to 1982 were victimized by my illness.","I have two books that were published quite some time ago. I start to read about three sentences. I have to close it. I am so self-conscious. Who did I think I was?","I tell people to monitor their self-pity. Self-pity is very unattractive.","I'm not sure I want all my neuroses cleared up.","My recovery from manic depression has been an evolution, not a sudden miracle.","The doctors must tell you that one of the risks of surgery is that you might die. This poor doctor was talking to an actress. It was very dramatic to me. To him, it was just a thing he had to say.","The Eleanor Roosevelt Award that I received for women's rights activities is one I treasure.","The panic attacks - I still have them. They started when I was around 8. They always have to do with my death.","I'm surviving a life-threatening illness. Many do not, such as those without celebrity and fortune who have to depend on the public healthcare system.","If stars behave in an erratic fashion, it's called 'colorful,' as opposed to, 'Well, maybe there's a problem there.'","I can't even remember how many times I tried to kill myself.","I had been very close to Anne Bancroft when we worked together in The Miracle Worker.","I have a picture of myself in my mind as I walk around every day, until I look in the mirror-and then I'm stunned.","I have been afraid all my life that I am going to die. All my life it has been stuffed in my imagination.","I kind of like the position of being the fair-haired savior of my mother.","I knew from a very young age that there was something very wrong with me.","I never did quite fit the glamour mode. It is life with my husband and family that is my high now.","I think my real depressions started when I was about 16 and doing The Patty Duke Show. I would go to bed at about 10 o'clock on a Friday night and not get up again until 6:30 Monday morning.","I'm living out a childhood fantasy. Our house is in a historic district of a small town that I used to read about in storybooks.","I've come to believe that whoever I am didn't start on December 14, 1946, and isn't going to end on whatever that mysterious date is in the future.","If I have any message for others, it is to go for help early and not to be a resistant patient.","Sometimes it is the simplest, seemingly most inane, most practical stuff that matters the most to someone.","When I don't know what the music is going to be for a scene, I imagine some sort of orchestration going on and damned if they don't usually come up with a similar kind of thing.","When I'm 80 and sitting in a rocking chair listening to the Rolling Stones, there is absolutely no way I'm going to feel old or forget my younger days.","You can have manic-depression without having an ounce of creativity.","I met my husband while I was making a movie.","I'm spoiled rotten, as my children would tell you.","Due to my sometimes erratic behavior, my children tried very hard to avoid me and not do anything to set me off.","I was a very isolated teenager.","I've gotten to the age where I'm comfortable with just about everything - except getting old!","Without a sense of humor, I would have been gone a long time ago.","When we want to say something negative to somebody we say, 'Aww, you're so crazy.'","My life was ripped off!","I worshipped my father.","I was a truly loving mom, but I didn't have the tools to do the job.","Fairness is really important to me.","It's not a giant thrill to hear someone give you the label 'manic-depressive,' but to me I was so relieved. What I was suffering from had a name and could be treated.","During the rocky times, it never occurred to me that one day I would hold a position of respect and responsibility in the community."],"Patty Griffin":["It's occurred to me I need to laugh at myself more, and that I don't need to be some sad folk singer all the time. I don't want to be the queen of pain.","I was asked to sing with Mavis Staples on a gospel compilation called 'Oh Happy Day.' And, you know, other than being totally intimidated at the prospect of singing with Mavis, I was honored. I don't really have much of a background in gospel music.","I'm going to be doing solo stuff. The idea is to do 'small' and 'off my beaten path,' or go back to an old, beaten path - do some smaller things that I haven't done in 15 or 20 years. Just to sort of get my feet wet, because I haven't done my own material for a couple of years - I've been doing a lot of other things.","Studios are designed to pull out all of that beautiful ambience you get from singing in a room, and then the engineer puts it back in digitally or through whatever machinery you've got.","I was brought up to express myself only when asked to express myself, and then to do so in a way that's pleasing to hear. But I've always had a need to make my presence known. I was just sort of born that way, I guess. It's my natural tendency.","God as 'He,' as a patriarchal thing, is offensive to me. It's standard fare for America, 'He, He, He.' Every time I hear that it's like another blow against females. It's very radical talk at this point for females to say this kind of stuff, but nationwide I still hear females referring to God as 'He.'","From the age of 12, I had an understanding that singing was something I loved to do more than anything, and I did say to myself, 'Why not?' But there were definitely some doubts along the way.","I'm confused that there is a lack of faith in listening to and deciding what is a great song and instead going for these formulaic, bad songs over and over again. But that's what happened when people from beverage companies bought record labels and radio stations as opposed to people who love music owning record labels.","I grew up as a Catholic, and there was so much that was beautiful there, and also so much that was troubling. The whole patriarchal thing, the whole male-dominated approach, really bothered me.","I grew up listening to AM radio in the '70s and hearing all of that great soul and rhythm and blues music, which definitely influenced the way I sing. But singing gospel has made me a much more humble person. There are so many people who were geniuses who only a few people knew about when they were alive.","I think listeners are hungry to hear quality.","When I started performing, I played acoustic music, partly because that way you don't have to worry about interacting too much with other people creatively. Asserting myself in that way was not really a strong point for me.","Fame is a can of worms I haven't really had to contend with.","I think there are times when a song can be a spiritual experience - just making music, in general, is pretty much that.","There's an imbalance when if a woman goes out for a walk at 3 in the morning and something happens to her it was somehow her fault, and with a man that's not true.","Often I have to move my body in a certain way, like exercising, to begin to get into the right rhythm for writing a song.","Everyone is tortured. Do you know anyone who isn't?","Along the way, I've had different advice from different music producers. I've been told to tone it down, that the quiet parts of my voice are appealing and there's harshness to the loud part of my voice.","I grew up Catholic, so I have these defenses about listening to anything with too much religiosity; some of the lyrics didn't sit well in my mouth. One of my beefs is the patriarchal setup. Having the 'he, he, he, God, God, God, king, king, king' stuff was hard for me.","I've noticed more people coming to shows and I've had a feeling that they were from a part of the culture I haven't been able to get to before, younger people. I think on iTunes they've been experimenting with my songs and the digital radio world has been very kind to me.","I don't actually have to think very hard when I'm writing. I mean, there are times where it's a task, and you have to plug away and plug away. But then there are times when a song writes itself in 15 minutes, and you're just struggling to keep up with it.","One of the great things that I loved about doing solo - which I ended up doing because I was too shy to ever try out for bands back in the day - I could sit there with a list of songs and 'paint away' for the show."],"Patty Hearst":["They called themselves an army. They were planning on recruiting more armies. They were planning on splitting up and forming smaller cells and going into different areas, recruiting more members and just growing until they had started a full scale war in this country.","Through my mind, is just the horror of these people. I had been held by them, I knew how violent they were.","For me, my awakening came when I was kidnapped.","Well, you know, it's really been, you know, quite a trip for me.","I finally figured out what my crime was. I lived. Big mistake.","I mean, they call it Stockholm Syndrome and post traumatic stress disorder. And, you know, I had no free will. I had virtually no free will until I was separated from them for about two weeks.","The son of the victim, you know, has been virtually forgotten until recently.","You know, my daughters have been through their entire lives and knowing about my case.","There is - you know, there's receipts for rented cars and license plates and guns and hand prints and palm prints and fingerprints. You know, I want to wait until I'm in a court.","There are two other SLA members who have been granted immunity and then also, one of the SLA members had confessed to two other people, and those people, I'm sure, will be called as witnesses, as they were at the grand jury.","My daughters have grown up knowing all about my kidnapping and the case and what happened.","I had not seen that until - and when it first came out I was told. I had not seen or been aware of all of that physical evidence. And when I saw it, I was horrified. It was so astounding to me to see that there was that much evidence.","And you probably remember all of those papers and documents that they had published in the newspapers. And, you know, when you look at that, it really was their own little jihad that they had going. It just wasn't taken very seriously then.","I had been, you know, held in the closet for two months and, you know, abused in all manner of ways. I was very good at doing what I was told.","Well, you know, they were - they were a terrorist group. They - when I was kidnapped they published all of their statements about their war that they declared on the United States.","But even before that, in 1980 I went so far as to write a book about what had happened. And I wrote all about the bank robbery, I went ahead and printed it even though I had no use immunity for it.","And, quite frankly, I fully expected to be charged with murder, because they weren't charging anybody. I did it in terms of, I felt like I was throwing down the gauntlet saying look, this is what happened. There's a family out there that needed to know what happened.","You know, sitting in the car when they got back in and - first of all, it was relief. I was not - there were two get away cars or switch cars they were called. And, you know, the group tended to include everyone.","Well, you know, one lawyer says I'm the only witness and I'm not credible. Another lawyer says this witness - there's tons of evidence that's been available for years.","It's hard to know what to say about somebody like that, except there are people who look for trouble. And trouble is very easy to find when you go looking for it.","I was not inside the bank. But I am still not the only witness.","I think Charles Manson was a hair's breath away from just being a terrorist. He wanted to start a war, too.","I mean, Emily Harris was his wife. And she seemed to resent his leadership, but on the other hand, she felt like a good soldier, that he had to be the leader.","I frankly don't think it's going to be a successful war on terrorism until law enforcement agencies like the FBI are willing to share with other law enforcement agencies. If they can't share information, there's no way this war can be won.","I do remember that I was very relieved that I did not have to go into a bank with them. I had, as you recall, I had already been brought into a bank before and it was better to be sitting outside.","Even to me, as I was trying to tell the government what had happened, it just didn't seem to matter.","But now Americans, they felt a sense of peace and protection because they've been separated by so many thousands of miles of ocean. And you know, the fact that it's come to the U.S. like this is so sad, and yet you know, what can you do? It's here.","And, you know, like I said, I'm not looking forward to a trial.","And here in Los Angeles, once again, I'm going to go down and be a witness. There's a guilty plea. I don't mind being on the witness stand, but I think they mind it a lot.","And for any victim of a violent crime, when you actually get to go in and realize and see their faces and know that they can't hurt you any more, there is no feeling like that. It finally frees you from a lot of demons."],"Patty Jenkins":["When people are crass or loudmouthed, it's not because they don't give a damn. It's from fear and insecurity.","It's not easy to be a hero. You do it because of what you believe, not because of what other people deserve.","I think that what Wonder Woman stands for is gorgeous and incredible.","We're all always wondering about our own limits, what we're capable of.","I'm excited to see her power really soar and us have a great time having a great Wonder Woman in our world.","To make a masterpiece would be my life's dream.","I have passed on a lot of things that would have been extremely lucrative, because they were nothing else.","Every villain has their belief system that makes perfect sense to them.","New kinds of heroics need to be celebrated - like love, thoughtfulness, forgiveness, diplomacy - or we're not going to get there.","If you want more diversity in the industry, you need diverse people writing scripts and developing them.","It's not about superheroes. This is the method of universal storytelling that all people have... To me, they're the same as the Greek myths or the Roman myths or religious figures of every religion. These are common characters that we use to express stories about being a better person or what you would do when faced with various things.","A woman doesn't have to direct a woman's film and a man doesn't have to direct a man's film; otherwise, where would we be?","I'd just sort of gravitated toward the arts, and I had always loved music and really loved theater, even though I didn't want to act. For some reason, being in Kansas, you can either be a graphic artist or a visual artist, so I decided, 'I guess I'm going to be a painter.'","I grew up in a bit of a feminist fantasy with a single mom. I was totally shielded, in a way, from an idea that I couldn't do something.","My father was a fighter pilot, so I moved around the world when I was young. Then I ended up in Kansas. I'd just sort of gravitated toward the arts, and I had always loved music and really loved theater even though I didn't want to act.","As soon as I went to painting school in New York, I took an experimental film course, and everything clicked and came together. I realized my love of music and drama and the visual arts all came together. This happened in 1989. Since then, it's been a long road of educating myself in every possible way.","Movies always had a captive audience, so they were able to do deeper, more complex things. Television was always about, 'Look at me now! Look at me now! Now go away!' That's starting to change.","The need to look behind the curtain is great for a filmmaker. But whether you want to deconstruct what you like as a viewer, what you like and don't like, I wish we could let films stand on their own a little bit.","To be a director, you need to be reliable, on time, confident, calm, all of those things you see demonstrated in the military.","I try not to buy into that whole, crazy 'you are what you drive' mentality here, but I wouldn't want to be seen in a Ford Fiesta - you know what I mean?","If you look at the history of Wonder Woman, you look at the iconography, the images that have kept her alive - they're not dark. The thing I think is so important to always keep in mind about her is how positive and bright and shiny she is - very much in the same way that Superman has been.","I think making a film that you think is good and you believe in is going to be difficult forever.","I can't stand characters with contradictory information.","I have a real pet peeve for women who play damaged characters but don't look damaged.","Frankly, I like DVDs having lots of things on it, but I have issues with it as well, too.","It's not palm trees and neon signs in Florida; it's strip malls, highways, hot sun beating down on you.","When I'm on a movie, I'm unavailable every day for a year and a half. You can't do that with a little baby. Somebody might be able to do it, but not me.","There's Batman, there's Superman, there's Wonder Woman. She's the full-blown real deal.","The idea of getting to make a movie like the ones that impacted me as a child is my life's dream.","My fantasy is that I could wake up looking amazing, that I could be strong and stop the bully, but that everybody would love me, too. I think that's intrinsic to fantasy - fantasy is fantasy.","Longevity of focus, I think, is the hardest part. You know it's to have a vision and then try to hold that vision and not have it change.","I have a long love of superhero films, and I'd been saying over and over again to my agents at CAA that I'd like to do one.","Hollywood can't stand heroes who aren't sympathetic.","I was a closet Journey fan when I was growing up.","It's rare that a character film is easy to fund.","There are a lot of pretty actresses in Hollywood who try to act tough, and the audience laughs.","It's been my experience with damaged people: they don't wake up every day and wallow in the bad things that have happened to them.","Strangely, I have a huge aversion to movies that try to teach healthy people an abusive lesson about the darkness in the world.","I have more information than anybody's ever had about this case. I have 7,000 letters from Aileen Wuornos and all the letters between her and her girlfriend.","If a film is based on a true story and you don't use anyone's name, you can do what you like.","De Niro didn't gain all that weight to play Jake La Motta just to prove he could get fat - every single one of those transformative things is grounded in the character.","I know that a man's version of a tough woman is very different from a woman's version.","I had to adapt to other worlds, and that helped to educate me that we are all basically the same.","That was devastating to me: how a bright, energetic kid could turn doomed and desperate.","I think that, for whatever reason, we've gotten to a place where, particularly in Hollywood, things have to be very pat. Like 'I'm a good guy. I'm a bad guy.'","I'd spent summers growing up in Mississippi, so I had an idea of what the South is like.","You do what you believe in.","Hollywood is driven by beautiful faces. Always has been.","Any sympathy won for Aileen Wuornos based on a lie is not sympathy at all. The question is, can we have sympathy for the circumstances of someone's life? That's what I was interested in.","Making a movie is such a huge commitment of emotion and time that I didn't want to be beholden to doing it for money.","My father was a fighter pilot, so I moved around the world when I was young. Then I ended up in Kansas.","As soon as I went to painting school in New York, I took an experimental film course, and everything clicked and came together. I realized my love of music and drama and the visual arts all came together.","I've been influenced by a lot of films. And a lot of them are the typical interesting, artsy films. But I haven't talked enough about how there are those few big blockbusters that really rock your world.","Superhero movies are so famous because of the metaphor that they trigger in one's self about who you could be if things were different.","I want to make great films in my lifetime, and I really want to make a great film about Wonder Woman.","Being the person who gets to make a movie about Wonder Woman, of course, I take that incredibly seriously. I am a huge Wonder Woman fan, and the aspiration comes totally naturally to me.","Who should make a great movie about Wonder Woman? It should be somebody who loves Wonder Woman. And I know that I'm that. So let's go and try.","There's an idea that action movies are more attractive to one gender than the other or different kinds of people or whatever. The truth is action is not any different than any other part of a story.","I remember when I read in the news that 'Wonder Woman' had been cast, and my heart sank. I had been talking to the studio for so long about doing it, and I was like, 'Well, 'that's that.' I'm sure we wouldn't have made the same choice.","It was harder, I think, to get attention for the films that I wanted to do than I expected it to be.","I don't think I focused on the financial part of it, but definitely, my ambition is to be great, and that always meant that the sky was the limit for what I was hoping to do.","I was thinking I would love to make something that is a successful film that everybody sees, but I wasn't thinking about the actual dollar amount. I just wanted to make a great film that people responded to. That's always a good ambition because you'll never totally hit it.","I think you need to have a strong vision of your own.","We want to teach a better way and to be a hero, and there's no one like Wonder Woman to do it.","I can't take on the history of 50 percent of the population just because I'm a woman.","What I never want to do is start phoning it in and making things just to show that I can keep my foot in the door and do big movies.","I grew up in a family of fighter pilots, and I have a real kindred spirit to that kind of fast-moving aggression and momentum.","I have an aggressive streak of my own.","It's like there's something very maternal about Wonder Woman: when push comes to shove, if nobody else wants to do it, Wonder Woman would step up and take care of business. But she doesn't want to do it, and she would never take any delight in it. That's Wonder Woman to me.","I don't think I could have made a good movie out of 'Thor 2' because I wasn't the right director. And I don't think I would have been in the running for 'Wonder Woman' as a result. And that's one of the reasons why I'm glad I didn't do it.","I think that in superhero movies, they fight other people; they fight villains.","To me, superhero movies are like Greek myth.","There's a lot of mythological stories you can tell. There's not just one. I appreciate all of those different kinds, but what I was personally missing was grand, classic, true-north hero. Pure and simple emotion, and also aiming for big time emotion, like love story as well, in a very sincere way. Like 'Superman: The Movie' had done for me.","To me, the two things that Gal Gadot - who is an amazing actress, and she played a great Wonder Woman - but the true things that she actually has inside of her are this incredible warmth and charm that is also informed by great intelligence. It's those two things.","I had an interesting moment with 'Wonder Woman' where, when I first thought about doing 'Wonder Woman 2,' I thought, 'Well, these are so intense, making these movies. It's a lot to think about doing more.' But then I had an epiphany, and I thought, 'Oh, it's not more - it's better.'","Just look at Gal Gadot when she smiles or when she meets somebody and shakes their hand. That is the embodiment of Wonder Woman. She is so beautiful and powerful, but kind and generous and thoughtful. She's just an amazing person.","It is ironic you could make an animated film about a dog that's a universal character, but God forbid it be a human being who is not a man.","I'm making a movie about Wonder Woman, who I love, who to me is one of the great superheroes, so I just treated her like a universal character, and that's what I think is the next step when I think you can do that more and more and when studios have the confidence to do that more and more.","When I made 'Monster,' I didn't think about it being about a woman. I didn't think about that she was a lesbian. I was telling a story about a specific person who was tragic and looking for love in the world, and the more I could make her you, the more of a victory.","I always say that 'Star Wars' had a huge effect on me, too, but what 'Star Wars' did for some people, 'Superman' did for me.","I've had tragedy in my life, and it doesn't stop comedy, so I think it's important to do both. Particularly in a superhero movie, but in any movie that accesses all people. Nobody wants to be abused for two hours.","The education of going through the 'Thor' experience was great.","I know that I'm carrying a bit of a weight on my shoulders of what I do represents more than just myself as a director. I wish that wasn't true, but it is. It makes me think about doing work that I believe in and that I believe I can do well, probably even a hair more than I would otherwise.","I never want to set a belief that a woman has to direct a woman's film, meaning she can't direct a man's film. If only films can be directed by people who are exactly the same as that, it's only gonna limit all of the women more.","I am super-comfortable with powerful women.","I love a great myth. I love a superhero origin story.","I don't love all superhero films, but I love a great one.","I believe in Wonder Woman and the true spirit of Wonder Woman, and I wanted to tell that story. I didn't want to make her an alt version of Wonder Woman.","Ultimately, so many things come down to money, but particularly when it comes to superheroes - people really thought that only men loved action movies and only men would go see a superhero movie.","I did not necessarily feel that Hollywood was interested in what I wanted to do. They wanted me to do what they wanted to do.","I love that duality of Wonder Woman: that she both wants peace and means peace, but when push comes to shove and someone needs to be put down like a dog, that's what she would be willing to do.","The thing about 'Wonder Woman,' which is very feminine and definitely different, is that her objective is to bring love and truth to mankind.","I grew up very inspired by 'Superman One' and by kind of the promise of the genre of what a superhero origin story can do.","I have a high bar for myself already; I always want to do something beautiful and meaningful.","I was aware that I was the first person of all time getting to direct a Wonder Woman film, and that was taken very seriously.","There was a movie I was trying to make right after 'Monster,' a bigger behemoth: the Chuck Yeager story. It was a life dream, but it just didn't line up. We just had issues with the life rights, ultimately.","There was a very difficult time when a female hero was a man in a woman's body. 'Hunger Games' really changed that: a woman leading a non-woman's film in the action genre. I think 'Wonder Woman' does that on a very big scale.","My father wanted to be a hero. He went to the Air Force Academy, was valedictorian, and then he found himself strafing villagers in Vietnam in a war he didn't want to be in and didn't understand. He was extremely conflicted about the line where he went from being the good guy to possibly being the bad guy.","I'm as interested in exceptional characters as men are.","TV is really hard to break into. This may be the worst piece of advice, but make an independent film. TV oftentimes takes people who are established. The great benefit of not breaking in yet is purity of voice.","I like to work, and I worked for years as a camera person before I directed.","At the end of the day, making 'Monster' was unbelievably hard, as making any movie is. And the only thing that made it worth it is not those awards and all those kind of things that I can barely remember because I was so overwhelmed. It was really that night in the editing room, that day on set. It was those things.","I do care about success and all of those things. But I don't care enough to do movies just for that reason.","There's the 7-year-old me that pretended to be Wonder Woman running around the schoolyard. Like, what an incredible thing to imagine that when the bully shows up or the villain, you would be strong enough to do something about it. But, also, you look like Lynda Carter while you're doing it - like, 'Oh, my God.'"],"Patty Judge":["I would certainly look at a proposal for tuition-free community college for two years if the students kept a certain high grade-point average.","Donald Trump at the head of the Republican ticket affords Democrats a great opportunity.","I was the first woman elected as secretary of agriculture in Iowa.","When I ran for secretary of agriculture in Iowa in 1996, people... were sure that Iowans would not consider electing a woman to that position.","I have worked with Chuck Grassley off and on through the years, and always had what I considered and what I think he'd consider a cordial working relationship.","I've had a lot of careers in my life. When I think about it, I think every piece of that - from being a nurse, a farmer, dealing with real estate - has added to a skill set that I would have been able to use throughout my political career.","I'm never very quiet; that's not my nature.","I don't know that free trade... is good for our country and good for Iowa and Iowa workers.","In rural communities, people are upset with the government, upset with what they see as business as usual. They saw Obama as a change agent, and they saw Donald Trump as a change agent.","I am not afraid to cross the party line. I never have been.","What I will stand up for is what I think is right and for the best interests of the citizens of the state of Iowa.","Washington is broken.","Our culture has changed. It has become more violent. People are literally afraid to go to the movies or to school.","From here in Iowa, it seems to be the wealthy and big corporations get enough help.","I think it is possible to meet people in the middle, to have a discussion even though you may not agree on solutions, and find some common ground and get to consensus.","The people in Iowa know that Washington isn't working. It's devolved into partisan politics and a lot of gridlock and obstruction.","Climate change is real.","We must reduce the influence of money in politics, beginning by overturning Citizens United and taking back our system from the millionaires and billionaires who can give unlimited and undisclosed amounts of money to influence our elections.","I am really not clear in my mind what a sanctuary city is.","Oh, what could be more delicious than replacing Chuck Grassley on the Senate Agriculture Committee?","We have to get back to a government where leaders are willing to talk across party lines and do not have absolute politics as the goal.","If you are elected to do a job, you are supposed to do it to the best of your ability.","I think women bring a different perspective and that we tend to be more collaborative in our approach. I served in the Iowa Senate back in the '90s, when there weren't a lot of us. At the time, I think there were five or six women, and two or three of them were Republicans and two or three were Democrats."],"Patty Loveless":["Good-byes are hard, but life is about changes.","I cut 'Diamond in My Crown' in my home in Georgia, because I wanted to use an old 1848 pump organ that my mother-in-law had gotten for Emory for Christmas one year. His mother would be proud to know that pump organ was made use of.","A lot of people have a cough that doesn't go away, or go up and down stairs and get shortness of breath, and they don't think about COPD. They could have a problem, though, and catching it in the beginning stages is crucial.","I get around nature. I have a vegetable garden, and I enjoy being outside. I do work quite a bit around the house.","My dad never missed a day of work, and he was always smiling when he came home.","I recalled how a lot of my older siblings would go to a friend's house and borrow records to play and sometimes borrow a turntable because we didn't have a turntable in the house until I was 8, about the same time we had a TV.","I love Miranda Lambert; I think she's wonderful. I love the song 'Love Letters' and 'Famous in a Small Town.'","It's kind of odd when you think of Loretta Lynn, when she was first traveling and recording country music. It was all built through word of mouth. If you pleased the fans, they would pass it around to their friends and family.","I started to perform when I was 12... I don't talk too much. I let the music do the talking.","I may not be able to re-record a song, but I can do a better job each time I sing it.","Music was always a big part of my family. Only a few of us had the talent - or the courage - to walk out on a stage.","I go out and walk around the yard. Sometimes I'll cut grass.","My sister, Dottie, suffered from COPD for quite a few years before we knew what it was. Hers was a form of emphysema, and she was 48 when she passed away.","After living out of a suitcase for years, it's a feeling of peace to wake up in the night and know where I am.","It's hard for me to sit still. Now if you'll sit me in front of a great old movie, I'll sit still, because I love that, too.","When I listen to my own records, I always think, 'Oh, I could have sung that so much better.' But you have to finish something and turn it in. If I didn't have folks who say, 'Come on, we need the record now,' I probably would never finish one.","I've had a wonderful career and shared the stage with Vince Gill, who was my second love.","George Jones is country soul. Once this kind of music sits in you and you take it all, it reaches down into your soul. George Jones to me was one of the most soulful singers of any genre. That drew me to his music. He knew how to present a song without really thinking about it.","I look for songs that the listener, when they hear it, they believe what I'm singing about, that I know what I'm singing about. That's my whole deal. I try to choose songs that a male or a female can perform and relate to."],"Patty Murray":["I think what's been lacking from our discussion for a long time is really that other part of what a Budget chair does, which is set the priorities for this country in terms of making sure we invest in the right places, in education, in job training, and to make sure we do a balanced approach moving forward.","The FDA is redefining birth control as abortion. The FDA is setting the bar higher for this kind of drug.","Good education means learning to read, write and most importantly learn how to learn so that you can be whatever you want to be when you grow up.","I'll be at the table, as I've been, willing to talk to any Republican who says, 'Look, my country is more important, this pile of bills is not going to go away, the challenges that we have is not going to disappear, we need to cross that divide.' I'm ready. I'm waiting.","I get the, you know, 'In my generation, we all had victory gardens, we all participated in this country's success.' It's that kind of sentiment that I hear from everybody, that we're all in this together.","Funding privatized accounts with Social Security dollars would not only make the program's long term problems worse, but many believe it represents a first step toward undermining the program's fundamental goals.","Caring for our veterans is the duty of a grateful nation. Unfortunately, the Bush administration and congressional Republicans have not lived up to this duty.","Security is still the most important issue facing Washington state residents and millions of Americans - the security of having a job, of access to affordable health care, of a quality education, and of protecting our homeland and defending our nation.","People are really worried about their jobs. That's what everybody talks to me about today.","I see success as bringing some confidence back to the American people that despite our differences, we can find some ways to move forward.","I want to make sure that all kids get a good education and enjoy what they learn.","Violence is a problem we all want to solve. I want to make sure that kids learn to deal with anger by learning how to talk with people to solve problems. Here in the United States Senate I want to make sure we have safe schools, safe neighborhoods and good things for kids to do after school!","We have sent our troops to war without paying for it. Now, we are bringing them home without saying how we are paying for it.","There is nothing new about these Republican attacks on our family planning decisions. In fact, from the moment they came into power, Republicans in the House of Representatives have been waging a war on women's health.","For the state of our union to be strong, we need to place value in Americans.","Guess what - I am one of the ONLY senators in the whole United States Senate that is computer literate!","We haven't been out in many of these countries helping them build infrastructure. How would they look at us today if we had been there helping them with some of that, rather than just being the people who are going to bomb in Iraq and go to Afghanistan?","If the Republicans get control back of the United States Senate, we will no longer have a check and balance on the White House, on the Republican Congress.","I am a mom as well as a senator!","I am fighting for those middle-class families who want us to deal with our debt and deficit, but they also want the investments that are critical to our country moving forward.","The Republicans can send the nation into turmoil, but we will not come to any agreement that does not include new revenue - and not just token new revenue. It is their choice."],"Patty Smyth":["I partnered with Headstrong because they give free and fast mental health support to our veterans who are most at risk. There is no red tape, and they get help within a day or two instead of weeks.","It's funny. You travel all over the world, and you wind up with a guy from your hometown.","Scandal rarely toured after those first few hits. I want to go out and sing and connect with fans who may have never seen us live.","I'd love to have a Christmas classic under my belt. It's hard to write a Christmas song.","I've lived most of my life in Manhattan, but I lived in Brooklyn for a while as a kid. I went to junior high school there. Girls in Brooklyn have to be tough - I mean real tough - just to get by. It's life in the combat zone.","Honesty is always hip.","Tennis players shouldn't get married. It hurts your game.","You had to have a great voice or talent as a musician before imaging or marketing plans came into play.","I'm not a Pat Benatar clone. I wish people would forget about that comparison.","When Scandal had a top 20 video, no one knew what I looked like. I had all this stuff on me.","We shot the video for 'Broken' where both my parents grew up. There was always a strong sense of serving our country in the neighborhood - my father and all my uncles served, and most of them enlisted.","Bios are always so dull and boring.","With a baby, you have to be responsible, selfless, and patient. I was never into those things. I got what I wanted. I did what I wanted. I didn't consider myself a patient person.","I listen to country music. I listen to jazz. I listen to R&B. I listen to Jimi Hendrix a lot.","In the past, I've allowed myself to record songs that I wish I had not, but agreed to for one reason or another.","It took a while for me to figure out how it all fit in, being a mother and being a woman and being a rock singer.","When I was a kid, those were carefree days without much pressure.","I went through a period of being disillusioned with touring.","When you have a different mother, you want to be in her world. Because in mine, I didn't feel like I fit in.","Being a mom was a full-time job. I was never willing to sacrifice everything for my career.","There aren't any coincidences. I think things really happen for a reason.","I haven't always made all of the right decisions from a career perspective, but things worked out in the end.","I'm able to do nothing.","You had to be tough to survive in my neighborhood.","When 'The Warrior' came out, Scandal was no more.","I'm a lead singer of a band, and that's so enough. It's not like I need to have my name on everything. The new name 'Scandal, Featuring Patty Smyth' was just to make it clear that I wasn't leaving the group.","The more rocking, the better.","Back when I first started with Scandal, I felt like I had to carry a lot of the weight because it was up to me to sell those songs.","You can't keep doing the same things when you get married and have a family. You have to slow down. You have to be responsible.","I don't want to bore people with stories about being in rock n' roll and being a mother. Other singers do it. I can, too. I just do what I have to do. It's not that hard. It's just different."],"Pau Gasol":["I won't forget the hood. I won't forget the days of catching a bullet on the way to the mailbox or bricks with death threats that somehow made their way through the window.","No one could have prepared for me BBQ on pizza. I mean, both are great. But together? It was incredible.","It doesn't matter who gets what. It's just a matter of doing what it takes to win.","Making the playoffs three consecutive seasons is a great accomplishment.","In-N-Out is incredible, but don't tell coach I've been going there. He would flip out and put some curse on me.","I'm not a person or a selfish player, but we have to move the ball more, and we have to look further the team game, because we have enough talent to use different players."],"Paul A. Volcker":["By the time I became chairman and there was more of a feeling of urgency, there was a willingness to accept more forceful measures to try to deal with the inflation.","I am suspicious of the idea of a new paradigm, to use that word, an entirely new structure of the economy.","It was the biggest inflation and the most sustained inflation that the United States had ever had.","The speed of communication, the speed of information transfer, the cheapness of communication, the ease of moving things around the world are a difference in kind as well as degree.","Well, by the standards of a lot of countries, by Latin American standards, it wasn't so bad.","Less emphasis on inventories, I think, may tend to dampen business cycles, because business cycles are typically in the grasp of inventory cycles and heavy industry cycles.","When people begin anticipating inflation, it doesn't do you any good anymore, because any benefit of inflation comes from the fact that you do better than you thought you were going to do.","What's the subject of life - to get rich? All of those fellows out there getting rich could be dancing around the real subject of life.","You could not buy a house in those days without just assuming that the house was not only a place to live, but it was a good investment, because it was going to keep up with inflation or get ahead of inflation, and it was just - that was America.","Double-digit inflation is a terrible thing - and it got up to 14 or 15 percent on a monthly basis for a while, shortly after I became chairman of the Fed."],"Paul Allen":["We've had some tough times, but we've hung in there.","You look at things you enjoy in your life, but much more important is what you can do to make the world a better place.","I'm a very private person that prefers a low profile.","Technology is notorious for engrossing people so much that they don't always focus on balance and enjoy life at the same time.","As a species, we've always been discoverers and adventurers, and space and the deep ocean are some of the last frontiers.","You've got to enjoy time with your family and friends, and if you're involved in sports franchises, those peak moments in playoff games. You have to enjoy life.","The possible is constantly being redefined, and I care deeply about helping humanity move forward.","What should exist? To me, that's the most exciting question imaginable. What do we need that we don't have? How can we realize our potential?","In the first eight or so years at Microsoft, we were always chained to our terminals, and after I got sick the first time, I decided that I was going to be more adventurous and explore more of the world.","In the computer industry, you've got an interdisciplinary team of people who can come together, attack the problem, and work in a collaborative style. You knock down one problem after another, cobble things together, and then hopefully turn the crank at some point.","That would be such a life-changing thing, for us all to know that there are other beings out there who we could potentially communicate with, or maybe we are listening to a signal that they transmitted hundreds of millennia ago.","Traditionally, Seattle has been a great sports town and great football town. What the Huskies have achieved over the years has been pretty amazing. That's how I got my first taste of football - when I went with my father to Husky Stadium.","In my own work, I've tried to anticipate what's coming over the horizon, to hasten its arrival, and to apply it to people's lives in a meaningful way.","I am very excited to be supporting one of the world's most visionary efforts to seek basic answers to some of the fundamental question about our universe and what other civilisations may exist elsewhere.","With documentary-film projects, you hope you highlight an area of concern people haven't thought about before. A lot of times, I'm asking myself - 'This seems to be a significant problem. What can be done that hasn't been done?'","In global warming, I think everyone is scratching their heads - are there technological things that can be brought to bear that can make a difference?","Once you become an owner of a team, you get so much more into the sport and you can't help it. So I really love NFL football now to the degree of following it much more than I did previously.","I enjoy creating new ideas, working on new creative projects.","When it comes to helping out, I don't believe in doing it for the media attention. My goal is to support the organizations that need help.","The best museums and museum exhibits about science or technology give you the feeling that, hey, this is interesting, but maybe I could do something here, too.","I grew up around books. When I first held the book and it was a substantive, tangible thing, and I thought of all the work that went into it, not just my work but everybody else's and the research and so forth, there's a sense of really have done something worthwhile.","If you think about making a difference in the community, my family has always had a strong interest in the arts. I'm always interested in finding ways to innovate... It's a blend; it's not a point focus.","While I sign off on trades or free agents, I've rarely overruled my basketball people's decisions. But I'm not shy about steering the discussion or pushing deeper if something doesn't make sense to me."],"Paul Anka":["Once you realize that you're in something that you've always wanted and you don't want to lose it, you behave differently. And that means the integrity, the professionalism, and knowing what's right from wrong and still making choices that you probably wouldn't have made.","The thing is to be able to outlast the trends.","If you're in pop music, you've got to deal with the changing of the guard every few years. By the time the '70s arrived, I was well aware of the cyclical nature of the game. Pop music is a creature of the moment; it thrives on the mood of its time. Either you hook into that or you're not going to be part of it.","I've always believed that if you don't stay moving, they will throw dirt on you.","For what is a man, what has he got? If not himself, then he has naught. To say the things he truly feels, and not the words of one who kneels.","My family was a good family, I had a great Canadian education and I came up in a great, little town like Ottawa.","As long as you're growing in your profession and you're respected, you're going to stay as clean as you can, because you've got something that you love that you don't want to lose.","I believe in criticism.","I learned a lot about what I do with my craft, how I present my music. A lot of things about him were very much an influence on me and everybody else. Once you get in that fold and you're around it, you get to experience something that I don't think we'll ever see again. There will never be anybody like Frank Sinatra. Ever.","When I'm writing, I generally toy with an idea until it manifests itself - meaning a phrase or a tune comes into my head and eventually begins to jell. When something hits me, I write it down immediately. I don't wait, or it's gone.","The technology is good and it's bad. You know what you're dealing with out there musically, but my head stops at this electronic stuff. I don't quite know what I'm dealing with out there yet.","I wrote 'She's a Lady' on the back of a TWA menu, flying back from London after doing Tom Jones's TV show. Jones's manager wanted me to write him a song. If I have an idea and I don't have a pad of paper, I'll write on whatever is available. What's the difference? Paper is paper.","Canada is a good country to be from. It has a gentler slower pace - it lends perspective.","I respect Jay-Z. I like him.","My demographic of people have been very supportive.","I had this talent for these stupid little teenage songs.","I just couldn't get anyone to sing my songs, so I had to sing my own tunes.","My father, my mother, and then my father was always on top of me - 'Keep your nose clean. Do you love what you're doing?' 'Yes.' 'Then be aware, or you're going to lose it.'","Things began to pick up for me record-wise when in 1971 I wrote 'She's a Lady' for Tom Jones."],"Paul Arden":["If you get stuck, draw with a different pen. Change your tools; it may free your thinking.","You need to aim beyond what you are capable of. You must develop a complete disregard for where your abilities end. Try to do things that you're incapable of... If you think you're incapable of running a company, make that your aim... Make your vision of where you want to be a reality. Nothing is impossible.","We are all advertising, all of the time. If you want to sell your car, what do you do? You clean and polish it and make it the best you can. Some people bake bread when they are trying to sell their house because the smell adds a friendly feeling. Even the priest, with all his or her fervour, is advertising God. Everybody is selling.","Your vision of where or who you want to be is your greatest asset.","There are rules in advertising, and those rules are self-imposed by the client companies because they don't want their products to be seen as dishonest.","The world is what you think of it. So think of it differently, and your life will change.","Risks are a measure of people. People who don't take them are trying to preserve what they have. Some risks have a future, and some people call them wrong. But being right may be like walking backwards, proving where you've been.","Advertising gets such a bashing from the world. At parties you are always asked, 'Aren't you just selling people things they don't want?'","Everybody wants to be good, but not many are prepared to make the sacrifices it takes to be great. To many people, being nice in order to be liked is more important. There's equal merit in that, but you must not confuse being good with being liked.","Have you noticed that the cleverest people at school are often not the ones who succeed in life?","We try to make sensible decisions with the facts in front of us. The problem with sensible decisions is that so is everyone else.","Knowledge comes from the past, so it's safe. It is also out of date. It's the opposite of originality... Experience is the opposite of being creative.","Without having a goal, it's difficult to score.","Great people have great egos; maybe that's what makes them great.","I've now discovered that if you know what you want and try hard to achieve it, everyone else will try hard, too.","I watch TV more than I used to, and the commercials don't impress me. The standard of execution is very high, but the standard of ideas is appalling.","Having too many ideas is not always a good thing."],"Paul Auster":["The world is so unpredictable. Things happen suddenly, unexpectedly. We want to feel we are in control of our own existence. In some ways we are, in some ways we're not. We are ruled by the forces of chance and coincidence.","You can't put your feet on the ground until you've touched the sky.","I'm living in the present, thinking about the past, hoping for the future.","We all die, we all get sick, we all feel hunger and lust and pain, and therefore human life is consistent from one generation to the other. We all - most of us, anyway - want connections with other people and spend our lives looking for them.","It's extremely difficult to get these jobs because you can't get a job on a ship unless you have seaman's paper's, and you can't get seaman's papers unless you have a job on a ship. There had to be a way to break through the circle, and he was the one who arranged it for me.","You see, the interesting thing about books, as opposed, say, to films, is that it's always just one person encountering the book, it's not an audience, it's one to one.","Children, I mean, think of your own childhood, how important the bedtime story was. How important these imaginary experiences were for you. They helped shape reality, and I think human beings wouldn't be human without narrative fiction.","I really have no interest in myself.","Baseball is a universe as large as life itself, and therefore all things in life, whether good or bad, whether tragic or comic, fall within its domain.","When you pick up a book, everyone knows it's imaginary. You don't have to pretend it's not a book. We don't have to pretend that people don't write books. That omniscient third-person narration isn't the only way to do it. Once you're writing in the first person, then the narrator is a writer.","The human body is strange and flawed and unpredictable. The human body has many secrets, and it does not divulge them to anyone, except those who have learned to wait.","We are continually shaped by the forces of coincidence.","Changing your mind is probably one of the most beautiful things people can do. And I've changed my mind about a lot of things over the years.","Everything can change at any moment, suddenly and forever.","Money's important. Everyone cares about money. And when you don't have money, money becomes the overriding obsession of your life.","Don't be a writer; it's a terrible way to live your life. There's nothing to be gained from it but poverty and obscurity and solitude. So if you have a taste for all those things, which means that you really are burning to do it, then go ahead and do it. But don't expect anything from anybody.","With a computer, you make your changes on the screen and then you print out a clean copy. With a typewriter, you can't get a clean manuscript unless you start again from scratch. It's an incredibly tedious process.","Human beings need stories, and we're looking for them in all kinds of places; whether it's television, whether it's comic books or movies, radio plays, whatever form, people are hungry for stories.","Those of us who can remember our childhoods will recall how ardently we relished the moment of the bedtime story, when our mother or father would sit down beside us in the semi-dark and read from a book of fairy tales.","If you're not ready for everything, you're not ready for anything.","Writing has always had that tactile quality for me. It's a physical experience.","I think it's a very good thing to leave your country and look at it from afar.","I've always written by hand. Mostly with a fountain pen, but sometimes with a pencil - especially for corrections.","I like the sound a typewriter makes.","I never experiment with anything in my books. Experimentation means you don't know what you're doing.","Some like to think that a keen appreciation of art can actually make us better people - more just, more moral, more sensitive, more understanding. Perhaps that is true - in certain rare, isolated cases.","You have to protect it too, you can't let just any stupid person take it and do something demoralizing with it. At the same time, I don't believe in being so rigid about controlling what happens either.","I'm really trying to dredge up what one might call intellectual and moral material. For example, when do you realize that you are an American? What age does that happen to you? When do you realize what religion your parents practice? When does it all become conscious? I was interested in exploring all of that.","I knew from the age of 16 that I wanted to be a writer because I just didn't think I could do anything else. So I read and read and wrote short stories and dreamed of escape.","The funny thing is that I feel close to all my characters. Deep, deep inside them all.","For me, a paragraph in a novel is a bit like a line in a poem. It has its own shape, its own music, its own integrity.","I've never been able to witness the birth of an idea. It seems as if one second, there's nothing particularly going on, and the next second, something is there. It's coming up out of my unconscious, up from places that I don't even know where they are.","It was a wrong number that started it, the telephone ringing three times in the dead of night, and the voice on the other end asking for someone he was not.","All I wanted to do was write - at the time, poems, and prose, too. I guess my ambition was simply to make money however I could to keep myself going in some modest way, and I didn't need much, I was unmarried at the time, no children.","I guess I wanted to leave America for awhile. It wasn't that I wanted to become an expatriate, or just never come back, I needed some breathing room. I'd already been translating French poetry, I'd been to Paris once before and liked it very much, and so I just went.","I was always interested in French poetry sort of as a sideline to my own work, I was translating contemporary French poets. That kind of spilled out into translation as a way to earn money, pay for food and put bread on the table.","I don't think that you can be prescriptive about anything, I mean, life is too complicated. Maybe there are novels where the author has not in the least thought about it in terms of film, which can be turned into good films.","I don't know if she should worry too much, I mean some of our greatest writers have had movies made of their books, lots of Hemingway novels were turned into movies, it doesn't hurt the book.","We construct a narrative for ourselves, and that's the thread that we follow from one day to the next. People who disintegrate as personalities are the ones who lose that thread.","There's hope for everyone. That's what makes the world go round.","If I could write directly on a typewriter or a computer, I would do it. But keyboards have always intimidated me. I've never been able to think clearly with my fingers in that position. A pen is a much more primitive instrument. You feel that the words are coming out of your body and then you dig the words into the page.","No book includes the entire world. It's limited. And so it doesn't seem like an aesthetic compromise to have to do that. There's so much other material to write about.","I really, truly believe that writing comes out of the body; of course, the mind is working as well, but it's a double thing and that doubleness is united. I mean, you can't separate persona from psyche; you just can't do it.","Chance is an element of life. What I try to do is study what I call the mechanics of reality as carefully as I can.","I woke up one day and thought: 'I want to write a book about the history of my body.' I could justify talking about my mother because it was in her body that my body began.","Holes in the memory. You grab on to some things, others have completely disappeared.","I think if we didn't contradict ourselves, it would be awfully boring. It would be tedious to be alive.","The most challenging project I've ever done, I think, is every single thing I've ever tried to do. It's never easy.","Some things get written more quickly than others, but I can't really measure degrees of difficulty.","I guess the toughest things in translations are word play, which can never be reproduced exactly.","People look at the same passage, and one person will say this is the best thing he's ever read, and another person will say it's absolutely idiotic. I mean, there's no way to reconcile those two things. You just have to forget the whole business of what people are saying.","All through my writing life, I've had this impulse to write autobiographical works.","I write the paragraph, then I'm crossing out, changing words, trying to improve it. When it seems more or less OK, then I type it up because sometimes it's almost illegible, and if I wait, I might not be able to read it the next day.","When I'm writing, I don't feel neurotic. So it's better for the family if I'm working.","I think New York has evolved in my work just the way the city has.","Every generation always thinks it was better before, and I think people have been saying this for probably thousands of years.","Each book I've done somehow finds its own unique form, a specific way it has to be written, and once I find it, I stick with it.","When I write, the story is always uppermost in my mind, and I feel that everything must be sacrificed to it. All elegant passages, all the curious details, all the so-called beautiful writing - if they are not truly relevant to what I am trying to say, then they have to go.","I was always very curious as a young man about why older writers who I met seemed so indifferent to what was going on, whereas I, in my 20s, was reading everything. Everything seemed important. But they were only interested in the writers they admired when they were young, and I didn't understand it then, but now, now I understand it.","History is present in all my novels. And whether I am directly talking about the sociological moment or just immersing my character in the environment, I am very aware of it.","There's love, and certainly children you care about more than yourself. But nevertheless, we're alone in our heads.","Even in New York, there are a lot of very attractive girls pedaling around. That just happens to be one of the nice sights in our city, seeing a young woman on a bike.","People who don't like my work say that the connections seem too arbitrary. But that's how life is.","Our lifelong certainties about the world can be demolished in a single second.","In my studio, it is unkempt and unattractive. Once I'm in my work, I don't notice where I am.","I'm not a man deeply interested in technology. It eludes me.","The kind of fiction I'm trying to write is about telling the truth.","You see the film, you might be entertained, and if it's not a great film, it loses its power very quickly. I think even simply acceptable books stay with us a lot longer.","Movies are not novels, and that's why, when filmmakers try to adapt novels, particularly long or complex novels, the result is almost always failure. It can't be done.","I can never say 'why' about anything I do. I suppose I can say 'how' and 'when' and 'what.' But 'why' is impenetrable to me.","Stories surge up out of nowhere, and if they feel compelling, you follow them. You let them unfold inside you and see where they are going to lead.","For some reason, all my characters come to me with their names attached to them. I never have to search for the names.","I really do feel part of America to my very bones; at the same time, I know that I come from somewhere else.","I think I hate cynicism more than anything else. It's the curse of our age, and I want to avoid it at all costs.","When you're young, you keep reading new writers and you keep changing your mind about how you ought to sound.","The book that convinced me I wanted to be a writer was 'Crime and Punishment'. I put the thing down after reading it in a fever over two or three days... I said, 'If this is what a book can be, then that is what I want to do.'","I'm generous. I give good tips. It's just - the way I live my life, ironically enough, is: I don't want anything. I'm not a consumer. I don't crave objects.","I barely can go shopping for clothes. I find it difficult to walk into stores. The whole thing bores me so much.","I don't think of myself as a metafictional writer at all. I think of myself as a classic writer, a realist writer, who tends to have flights of fancy at times, but nevertheless, my feet are mostly on the ground.","I started out in life as a poet; I was only writing poetry all through my 20s. It wasn't until I was about 30 that I got serious about writing prose. While I was writing poems, I would often divert myself by reading detective novels; I liked them.","The most deeply personal of my works are the non-fiction works, the autobiographical works, because there, I'm talking about myself very directly.","Becoming a writer is not a 'career decision' like becoming a doctor or a policeman. You don't choose it so much as get chosen, and once you accept the fact that you're not fit for anything else, you have to be prepared to walk a long, hard road for the rest of your days.","What keeps me up at night? Anxiety. Anxiety, the inability to go to sleep, it's quite literally that.","What used to keep me up at night was the fact that I didn't know how I was going to pay the rent. Now that I can pay the rent, I'm worrying about people I care about, you know, the people I love. The little aches and pains of my children that I, my family. That's always first.","I believe that the whole idea of the consumer society is tottering. We've kept ourselves going by producing more and more goods, most of which people don't need. I'm anti-consumerism; I own four pairs of black Levis and that's it.","Writing makes you feel that there is a reason to go on living. If I couldn't write, I would stop breathing.","Writing is such a strange, utterly mysterious process. First, there was nothing; then, suddenly, there was something. I don't know where thoughts are born. Where the hell does it come from? I don't know. I really don't know.","How is it possible for someone who believes that the world was created in six days to have a rational conversation with me, who doesn't believe that, about other possibilities?","I've learned not to look at reviews. Early on, I did. I was always curious.","You tend to feel very hurt when people attack you and feel indifferent when you get praise. You think, 'Of course they like it. They should like it.'","We grow older, but we do not change. We become more sophisticated, but at bottom we continue to resemble our young selves, eager to listen to the next story and the next, and the next.","Films and television and even comic books are churning out vast quantities of fictional narratives, and the public continues to swallow them up with great passion. That is because human beings need stories."],"Paul Begala":["I'm very sunny. You know, I'm always optimistic.","If George W. Bush is given a second term, and retains a Republican Congress and a compliant federal judiciary, he and his allies are likely to embark on a campaign of political retribution the likes of which we haven't seen since Richard Nixon.","This gets back to the fundamental lesson of political survival that Bill Clinton taught me, which is if you make it about the American people's lives instead of your life, you're going to be okay.","I grew up in Tom DeLay's district.","Again and again, I've seen Bush turn a blind eye as his henchmen have leveled zealous attacks against his political enemies - assaults which the president himself has sometimes directly encouraged.","One of the problems we saw in the last presidential election in our party is that our nominee, while winning the election, which we ought never to forget, often lost sight of the difference between strategy and tactics.","It seems to me the American people never really forgave the Democrats for being right about Vietnam.","So one important lesson of Vietnam is, the first casualty of an unwise and unjust war are the American troops called on to fight it. Their service should be honored.","I'm a Catholic, but I used to love going to Vacation Bible School with my fundamentalist friends.","I don't like being a voyeur, looking into other people's marriages.","I try hard to be a good Catholic.","I didn't spend a lot of time on national security the American people will be glad to know.","But I think what happened was that Clinton knew how to fight back. And the way he fought back was on the issues - being tough in staying on the things that mattered to people in their lives.","If it was about lying under oath - we actually know that Clinton certainly was deceptive, as most people would be about their sex lives - but, in fact, he did not lie.","Politics is show business for ugly people.","Most politicians, when they meet with a guy like me, or a guy like Carville, tell you about how they can win.","I was the guy that told Bill Clinton he was going to win. I had gotten the final polling numbers. He had a comfortable lead. He was not going to lose.","I think too many Democrats are too wimpy. But I think they're beginning to toughen up.","There's the great line: the definition of a liberal is someone who's afraid to take their own side in a fight. And that's my problem with my fellow liberals.","I mean, for all of his faults and the troubles in his marriage, Bill Clinton is still married to a girl he met in the library 25 years ago at school. Can we say that about many of our other leaders today in America, including on the right wing?","Never interrupt your opponent when he's destroying himself.","It must kill George Bush that John McCain is the most popular and Beloved Republican in America.","It taught me that Clinton's instinct to make this about your life as a citizen, rather than his as a human being, was the right answer to these things.","My view was that the campaign had been a sacred thing, that it had been a real compact, because I was there and I saw the connection that Clinton made with people, and the connection that they made with him.","I used to go in at 5:30 or 6:00 so I could run.","Again, President Reagan was sort of an amiable presence out at the ranch by the last 6 months of his presidency. He had no effect on national policy at all.","Defining the terms of the debate generally dictates who's gonna' win it.","Bush began helping Enron in the eighties.","See, I think if it just became who's sleeping with whom, then there's no reason to prefer one party over the other, 'cause the truth is we're all sinners.","Bill and Hillary Clinton are the most investigated couple in American history - now the most thoroughly exonerated couple in American history."],"Paul Berg":["Looking back, I realize that nurturing curiosity and the instinct to seek solutions are perhaps the most important contributions education can make.","With time, many of the facts I learned were forgotten but I never lost the excitement of discovery.","Today, it is research with human embryonic stem cells and attempts to prepare cloned stem cells for research and medical therapies that are being disavowed as being ethically unacceptable.","But the prospects of designing chemical plants for industrial scale chemical processes seemed far less interesting than the chemical events that occur in biological systems.","That work led to the emergence of the recombinant DNA technology thereby providing a major tool for analyzing mammalian gene structure and function and formed the basis for me receiving the 1980 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.","Moreover, the concern of some that moving DNA among species would breach customary breeding barriers and have profound effects on natural evolutionary processes has substantially disappeared as the science revealed that such exchanges occur in nature.","By then, I was making the slow transition from classical biochemistry to molecular biology and becoming increasingly preoccupied with how genes act and how proteins are made.","Paradoxically, no such embargo exists for the drugs and therapies that have revolutionized the treatment of serious diseases although many of them were created with the same technologies.","Yet the effort to inform the public also encouraged responsible public discussion that succeeded in developing a consensus for the measured approach that many scientists supported.","But I felt it necessary to be part of the war effort and I enlisted in the Navy to be a flyer.","By that time I was hooked on a career in academic research instead of one in the pharmaceutical industry that I had originally considered in deciding to get a PhD.","Novel technologies and ideas that impinge on human biology and their perceived impact on human values have renewed strains in the relationship between science and society.","Fears of creating new kinds of plagues or of altering human evolution or of irreversibly altering the environment were only some of the concerns that were rampant."],"Paul Bettany":["The trouble with talking about acting is that it's like sex. It's enormously fun to do but just dreadfully embarrassing when you have to talk about it.","It's weird, because usually if you're British and you go to America you play baddies; but I play naughty people here and goodies in America.","The difficulty of looking at a system like natural selection if you have any sort of moral sense yourself, is almost what makes it beautiful.","I was born a Catholic and now I'm a lapsed Catholic. I'm something but I'm not a believer any more.","For some ungodly reason, I end up being naked in a lot of stuff. But there is a certain grace and kudos that come with taking your clothes off on the first day, a respect that is given by the rest of the cast.","I feel safe in saying this, and that is that Peter Weir is without a doubt one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. I'd open a door in a movie for him if he asked me to.","In America, they shoot budgets and schedules, and they don't shoot films any more. There's more opportunity in Europe to make films that at least have a purity of intent.","The only thing I think I can be accused of about paparazzi is being really naive. I didn't think about it coming along with the job and I never, during my three years at drama school, fantasized about one bit of it.","Up until like five seconds ago, I just took what jobs came along.","But I feel truly wowed by the architecture and the meaning of the architecture if you get lost in it and think about the man hours in the smallest little chapel, and the love involved. God it's fantastic.","The fact that in America bread lasts so long. You buy bread, and then it's bread forever - it's Forever Bread!","I think when you're trying to produce a relationship on screen that doesn't actually exist, perhaps sometimes there's a temptation to look at each other more, to touch each other more.","For a while, I stopped enjoying making movies and I stopped enjoying acting, because I made a few decisions that I wish I hadn't made.","So the actual privilege is that you can then take time off - and if you don't, you're a fool. You're earning all this money to support children whom you then don't see, which is absurd.","I'm sure some people have an absolute grasp of where they are in their careers. I just don't think about it that much.","I still read the British papers, but I've never been a Royalist, ever. It's funny, there always seems to be much more of a fascination with the Royal Family over here then there does in England.","Yeah, I love history and I loved it as a kid."],"Paul Biya":["I want to believe that those who have been appointed to accomplish this mission will be totally committed, devoting all their skills and determination to their work. I urge you to lend them your support so that, together, we can build that bright future worthy of our country.","We now need to look beyond our immediate future and aim higher and farther.","Slowly but surely, we are acquiring that famous culture of democracy, which is our objective."],"Paul Bloom":["We are constituted so that simple acts of kindness, such as giving to charity or expressing gratitude, have a positive effect on our long-term moods. The key to the happy life, it seems, is the good life: a life with sustained relationships, challenging work, and connections to community.","Some of the natural world is appealing, some of it is terrifying, and some of it grosses us out. Modern people don't want to be dropped naked into a swamp. We want to tour Yosemite with our water bottles and G.P.S. devices. The natural world is a source of happiness and fulfillment, but only when prescribed in the right doses.","Most of us know nothing about constitutional law, so it's hardly surprising that we take sides in the Obamacare debate the way we root for the Red Sox or the Yankees. Loyalty to the team is what matters.","Relying on the face might be human nature - even babies prefer to look at attractive people. But, of course, judging someone based on the geometry of his features is, from a moral and legal standpoint, no better than judging him based on the color of his skin.","Empathy has some unfortunate features - it is parochial, narrow-minded, and innumerate. We're often at our best when we're smart enough not to rely on it.","Natural selection shaped the human brain to be drawn toward aspects of nature that enhance our survival and reproduction, like verdant landscapes and docile creatures. There is no payoff to getting the warm fuzzies in the presence of rats, snakes, mosquitoes, cockroaches, herpes simplex and the rabies virus.","If our moral attitudes are entirely the result of nonrational factors, such as gut feelings and the absorption of cultural norms, they should either be stable or randomly drift over time, like skirt lengths or the widths of ties. They shouldn't show systematic change over human history. But they do.","We know that young babies, as they become capable of moving voluntarily, will share. They will share food, for instance, with their siblings and with kids that are around. They will sooth. If they see somebody else in pain, even the youngest of toddlers will try to reach out and pat the person.","The emotions triggered by fiction are very real. When Charles Dickens wrote about the death of Little Nell in the 1840s, people wept - and I'm sure that the death of characters in J.K. Rowling's 'Harry Potter' series led to similar tears.","One way to make a baby cry is to expose it to cries of other babies. There's sort of contagiousness to the crying. It's not just crying. We also know that if a baby sees another human in silent pain, it will distress the baby. It seems part of our very nature is to suffer at the suffering of others.","If you look within the United States, religion seems to make you a better person. Yet atheist societies do very well - better, in many ways, than devout ones.","Our best hope for the future is not to get people to think of all humanity as family - that's impossible. It lies, instead, in an appreciation of the fact that, even if we don't empathize with distant strangers, their lives have the same value as the lives of those we love.","The enjoyment we get from something is powerfully influenced by what we think that thing really is. This is true for intellectual pleasures, such as the appreciation of paintings and stories, and it is true as well for pleasures that seem simpler and more animalistic, such as the satisfaction of hunger and lust.","The irrationality of disgust suggests it is unreliable as a source of moral insight. There may be good arguments against gay marriage, partial-birth abortions and human cloning, but the fact that some people find such acts to be disgusting should carry no weight.","Periods of cooperation between political parties shouldn't be taken for granted; they are a stunning human achievement.","Humans are born with a hard-wired morality: a sense of good and evil is bred in the bone. I know this claim might sound outlandish, but it's supported now by research in several laboratories.","On many issues, empathy can pull us in the wrong direction. The outrage that comes from adopting the perspective of a victim can drive an appetite for retribution.","Maybe one of the most heartening findings from the psychology of pleasure is there's more to looking good than your physical appearance. If you like somebody, they look better to you. This is why spouses in happy marriages tend to think that their husband or wife looks much better than anyone else thinks that they do.","Humans are social beings, and we are happier, and better, when connected to others.","We'd be really screwed if we had to start our life over again as children with our brains right now, because I think we lose the plasticity and flexibility.","We are naturally moral beings, but our environments can enhance - or, sadly, degrade - this innate moral sense.","Too often, our concern for specific individuals today means neglecting crises that will harm countless people in the future.","More-radical scholars insist that an inherent clash exists between science and our long-held conceptions about consciousness and moral agency: if you accept that our brains are a myriad of smaller components, you must reject such notions as character, praise, blame, and free will.","The real problem with natural selection is that it makes no intuitive sense. It is like quantum physics; we may intellectually grasp it, but it will never feel right to us.","Perhaps looking out through big baby eyes - if we could - would not be as revelatory experience as many imagine. We might see a world inhabited by objects and people, a world infused with causation, agency, and morality - a world that would surprise us not by its freshness but by its familiarity.","I think what a lot of fiction is, is the imagining of the worst so as to prepare ourselves.","I want to convince you that humans are, to some extent, natural born essentialists. What I mean by this is we don't just respond to things as we see them or feel them or hear them. Rather, our response is conditioned on our beliefs, about what they really are, what they came from, what they're made of, what their hidden nature is.","It's really difficult working with kids and with babies because they are not cooperative subjects: they are not socialized into the idea that they should cheerfully and cooperatively give you information. They're not like undergraduates, who you can bribe with beer money or course credit.","Having kids has proven to be this amazing - for me, this amazing source of ideas of anecdotes, of examples, I can test my own kids without human subject permission, so they pilot - I pilot my ideas on them. And so it is a tremendous advantage to have kids if you're going to be a developmental psychologist.","You'd expect, as good Darwinian creatures, we would evolve to be fascinated with how the world really is, and we would use language to convey real-world information, we'd be obsessed with knowing the way things are, and we would entirely reject stories that aren't true. They're useless. But that's not the way we work.","A growing body of evidence suggests that humans do have a rudimentary moral sense from the very start of life.","The genetic you and the neural you aren't alternatives to the conscious you. They are its foundations.","Strong moral arguments exist for why we should often try to ignore stereotypes or override them. But we shouldn't assume they represent some irrational quirk of the unconscious mind. In fact, they're largely the consequence of the mind's attempt to make a rational decision.","Some scholars argue that although the brain might contain neural subsystems, or modules, specialized for tasks like recognizing faces and understanding language, it also contains a part that constitutes a person, a self: the chief executive of all the subsystems.","Enjoying fiction requires a shift in selfhood. You give up your own identity and try on the identities of other people, adopting their perspectives so as to share their experiences. This allows us to enjoy fictional events that would shock and sadden us in real life.","We benefit, intellectually and personally, from the interplay between different selves, from the balance between long-term contemplation and short-term impulse. We should be wary about tipping the scales too far. The community of selves shouldn't be a democracy, but it shouldn't be a dictatorship, either.","It is clear that rituals and sacrifices can bring people together, and it may well be that a group that does such things has an advantage over one that does not. But it is not clear why a religion has to be involved. Why are gods, souls, an afterlife, miracles, divine creation of the universe, and so on brought in?","We can imagine our bodies being destroyed, our brains ceasing to function, our bones turning to dust, but it is harder - some would say impossible - to imagine the end of our very existence.","A sympathetic parent might see the spark of consciousness in a baby's large eyes and eagerly accept the popular claim that babies are wonderful learners, but it is hard to avoid the impression that they begin as ignorant as bread loaves.","If Inigo Montoya were around now, he wouldn't need to storm the castle to bring his father's murderer to justice; the police would do it for him, and fewer people would have to die.","Families survive the Terrible Twos because toddlers aren't strong enough to kill with their hands and aren't capable of using lethal weapons. A 2-year-old with the physical capacities of an adult would be terrifying.","Part of the satisfaction of tattling surely comes from showing oneself to adults as a good moral agent, a responsible being who is sensitive to right and wrong. But I would bet that children would tattle even if they could do so only anonymously. They would do it just to have justice done.","Almost nobody believes anymore that infants are insensate blobs. It seems both mad and evil to deny experience and feeling to a laughing, gurgling creature.","Imagination tends to be truly useful if accompanied by the power of mental control - if the worlds in one's head can be purposefully manipulated and distinguished from the real one outside it.","Empty heads, cognitive science has taught us, learn nothing. The powerful cultural and personal flexibility of our species is owed at least in part to our starting off so well-informed; we are good learners because we know what to pay attention to and what questions are the right ones to ask.","Morality is often seen as an innovation, like agriculture and writing. From this perspective, babies are pint-sized psychopaths, self-interested beings who need to be taught moral notions such as the wrongness of harming another person.","I have my own difficulty with movies in which the suffering of the characters is too real, and many find it difficult to watch comedies that rely too heavily on embarrassment; the vicarious reaction to this is too unpleasant.","Imagination is Reality Lite - a useful substitute when the real pleasure is inaccessible, too risky, or too much work.","Any simple claim that you need religion to be good is flat wrong.","Even in the most peaceful communities, an appetite for violence shows up in dreams, fantasies, sports, play, literature, movies and television. And, so long as we don't transform into angels, violence and the threat of violence - as in punishment and deterrence - is needed to rein in our worst instincts.","Once we accept violence as an adaptation, it makes sense that its expression is calibrated to the environment. The same individual will behave differently if he comes of age in Detroit, Mich., versus Windsor, Ontario; in New York in the 1980s versus New York now; in a culture of honor versus a culture of dignity.","If our wondrous kindness is evidence for God, is our capacity for great evil proof of the Devil?","Modern science tells us that the conscious self arises from a purely physical brain. We do not have immaterial souls.","I don't doubt that the explanation for consciousness will arise from the mercilessly scientific account of psychology and neuroscience, but, still, isn't it neat that the universe is such that it gave rise to conscious beings like you and me?","If evil is empathy erosion, and empathy erosion is a form of illness, then evil turns out to be nothing more than a particularly awful psychological disorder.","In politics and in society, we can use our reason to rise above our parochial natures. Too bad that our elected officials don't choose to do so more often."],"Paul Bowles":["The sky hides the night behind it, and shelters the people beneath from the horror that lies above.","If people and their manner of living were alike everywhere, there would not be much point in moving from one place to another."],"Paul Bremer":["I think there really is no shortcut to sovereignty.","If you look back today over the last 25 years, it is a fact that we have had a progressive degeneration of our intelligence community in general; in particular in the field of human intelligence.","These people hate the United States, not for what we do, but for who we are and what we are.","I hope they're going to learn, and as a result of our response, that it isn't going to work. They're not going to change our life, they're not going to have us throw out our Constitution, and they're not going to chase us out of the Middle East.","I think the Iraqi people have shown extraordinary patience and courage in the last few months. They have really put a political system on the way to success, to a real democracy here.","I think we Americans, of all people, understand the importance of a good, legal, constitutional framework as the basis of political life.","I think what we've learned is that the terrorist threat is serious, but it shifts. You cannot make a single person the sole focus of your counterterrorism.","Iraq has become, for better or for worse, the front on the war on terrorism, and so we've got to do this, and I can understand why congressmen and senators would take their responsibility seriously, but I think in the end we'll get the money.","Saddam spent 35 years stealing and wasting money, and all of these systems are very fragile and brittle, and you try to fix one thing and something else gets in trouble.","There are 40,000 Iraqi police on duty around the country. If they detect an attack about to happen, the police are the ones who are supposed to stop it.","We've thrown out Saddam and Saddam, dead or alive, is finished in Iraq.","When the new wave of terrorism came on the modern world, which is the late 1960s, early 1970s, I think we spent about a decade, the United States and our allies, trying to figure out how to deal with it.","While it's very hard to know exactly how to measure public opinion there, because there's no really good polling, the fact of the matter is that in all the polls I've seen the vast majority of the Iraqis prefer to be free and are pleased that the coalition freed them.","You know, the country is basically peaceful.","I leave Iraq gladdened by what has been accomplished and confident your future is full of hope.","Iraq is a better place, absolutely worth it.","It is certainly not unrealistic to think we could have elections by mid-year 2004 and when a sovereign government is installed - my job here will be done.","We try very quickly to show that we are not at war with the Iraqi people. We're trying to deal with the people who are indeed themselves at war with the Iraqi people."],"Paul Broun":["It's absolutely critical that we audit the Fed so the American people can see what's going on over there. Do it from top to bottom so that we can have transparency in this entity called the Federal Reserve. Hopefully, the American people will see that we need to go back to the gold standard, which I've introduced, and get rid of the Fed.","We have got to protect privacy rights. We have got to protect our God-given, constitutionally protected civil liberties, and we are not doing that in the federal government. The Department of Homeland Security, as well as the TSA, is a great culprit in being a Gestapo-type organization.","As one of the most conservative members of Congress and a staunch supporter of the 2nd Amendment, I am constantly under attack for my values and beliefs.","These illegal aliens are criminals and we need to treat them as such. I'm not in favor of giving amnesty to anybody who has broken the law. I applaud what our Georgia legislature is doing in trying to crack down on this situation.","As your congressman, I hold the Holy Bible as being the major directions to me of how I vote in Washington D.C.","The Second Amendment is the one that really protects all of our liberties that we are given by our Lord, and our God-given rights, and are protected under the Constitution.","I'm very disappointed with the McCain campaign. In my opinion, it was inept.","When Barack Obama is right, then I'll support him. When he is wrong, I'll fight him.","The Constitution I uphold and defend is the one I carry in my pocket all the time, the U.S. Constitution. I don't know what Constitution that other members of Congress uphold, but it's not this one. I think the only Constitution that Barack Obama upholds is the Soviet constitution, not this one.","All that stuff I was taught about evolution, embryology, the Big Bang theory, all that is lies straight from the pit of Hell. And it's lies to try to keep me and all the folks who were taught that from understanding that they need a savior.","I don't believe that the Earth's but about 9,000 years old. I believe it was created in six days as we know them. That's what the Bible says.","Truth be told, except for foreign policy, Ron Paul's voting record and mine are virtually identical and I wear it as a badge of honor.","Obama believes in a big central government, where the federal government controls everything in our lives. That's socialism.","When I was sworn in the Marine Corps in 1964, when I was sworn into Congress, I swore to uphold the Constitution against enemies, both foreign and domestic. We have a lot of domestic enemies of - of the Constitution, those who want to pervert it, those who want to change it.","We have a tremendous lack of knowledge of how far we have gotten away from the Constitution of the United States. Democrats and Republicans alike have taken us away from the original intent. You see, I believe in this document as our founding fathers intended it.","We should have a very limited federal government.","I'm a Christian but only me and the Lord know that for sure.","America has to stand up and decide if we want to be a socialist nation or if we're going to be a free nation.","There's a lot of scientific data that I found out as a scientist that actually show that this is really a young Earth.","It teaches us how to run our lives individually. How to run our families, how to run our churches. But it teaches us how to run all our public policy and everything in society. And that's the reason, as your congressman, I hold the Holy Bible as being the major directions to me of how I vote in Washington, D.C., and I'll continue to do that.","There are more people killed with baseball bats and hammers than are killed with guns.","If I shoot it, I'm gonna eat it.","If passed by the U.N. and ratified by the U.S. Senate, the U.N. Small Arms Treaty would almost certainly force the United States to... create an international gun registry, setting the stage for full-scale gun confiscation.","They all want to be me. They do! What everybody else says they will do, I've already been doing. They all want to be me. It's become a joke in Congress how Dr. Gingrey and Mr. Kingston have been following my votes. They've even changed votes to what I voted, multiple times. Members of Congress are laughing about it.","When the media's attacking me, when the establishment Republicans are attacking me and the Democrats are attacking me, that means I'm the 'We the People' person, and I'm on the right course as far as I'm concerned.","I represent poor people, I represent working people. I represent senior citizens. I represent family businesses. I represent people who don't have the wherewithal to hire overpriced Washington lobbyists and lawyers. I want to send the powers back to the states and the people.","There are some in black robes sitting on federal benches all across this country. They're Democrats, Republicans, liberals, and even conservatives that pervert the Constitution.","If 10 percent is good enough for the Lord, it ought to be good enough for Uncle Sam.","I think the federal government should be doing only what the Constitution says it should be. We don't have authority under the federal Constitution to have a big federal criminal justice system.","Ignorance of the law is not a valid excuse for accused criminals, and it cannot be an excuse for members of Congress.","I do go against my leadership all the time because I stand firm on the four questions that I ask about all legislation. The first, is it constitutional according to the original intent? The second, does it fit the Judeo-Christian Biblical principles that our nation is founded upon? Third, do we need it? Fourth, can we afford it?","I condemn all statements - made in sincerity or jest - that threaten or suggest the use of violence against the president of the United States or any other public official. Such rhetoric cannot and will not be tolerated.","Obamacare is going to destroy our economy and destroy our freedom.","I don't want to fix Obamacare, I want to get rid of it.","It's no secret that the Democrats and liberal media would love to take away our guns and mandate every aspect of our lives, but I refuse to let them get away with that.","Georgians aren't interested in labels or affiliation, they're interested in solutions. And that begins by making Washington smaller and America bigger!","We have got to cut the spending. We have got to fix Medicare and Social Security. And actually, if we don't cut spending, this country is already broke. We are going off the financial cliff: the big cliff that is going to cause a total economic collapse of America.","I appeal to people all across the political spectrum.","TSA needs to be totally changed. I would like them to be privatized.","As a physician, I know that human life begins with fertilization, and I remain committed to ending abortion in all stages of pregnancy. I will continue to fight this atrocity on behalf of the unborn, and I hope my colleagues will support me in doing so.","We know that when law abiding citizens who know how to utilize a firearm have one on their person, it helps prevent crime.","These gun-free areas are actually - they're free-shooting zones for people because they know that there won't be anybody there that can stop them."],"Paul Brown":["When you win, say nothing. When you lose, say less.","The key to winning is poise under stress.","A winner never whines.","You can learn a line from a win and a book from a defeat.","What we have currently available is what we have available.","Football is a game of errors. The team that makes the fewest errors in a game usually wins."],"Paul Brunton":["Solitude is strength; to depend on the presence of the crowd is weakness. The man who needs a mob to nerve him is much more alone than he imagines.","Worry is spiritual short sight. Its cure is intelligent faith."],"Paul Bryant":["If you believe in yourself and have dedication and pride - and never quit, you'll be a winner. The price of victory is high but so are the rewards.","Show class, have pride, and display character. If you do, winning takes care of itself.","There's a lot of blood, sweat, and guts between dreams and success.","No coach has ever won a game by what he knows; it's what his players know that counts.","There's no use fussing on a boy who doesn't have any ability.","A good, quick, small team can beat a big, slow team any time.","You never know how a horse will pull until you hook him to a heavy load.","Don't give up at half time. Concentrate on winning the second half.","I ain't nothing but a winner.","Winning isn't everything, but it beats anything that comes in second.","In a crisis, don't hide behind anything or anybody. They're going to find you anyway.","Never be too proud to get down on your knees and pray.","It's nice to have the opportunity to play for so much money, but it's nicer to win it.","If anything goes bad, I did it. If anything goes semi-good, we did it. If anything goes really good, then you did it. That's all it takes to get people to win football games for you.","There's no substitute for guts.","If you whoop and holler all the time, the players just get used to it."],"Paul Buchheit":["Only my phone number and email are private because I don't want random people calling me. But I like the ability to share everything.","I'm just more excited about helping new entrepreneurs create the next Facebook or Google.","I think the best kind of virality is a product that people like so much that they just want to tell people about it.","I look to see what things I enjoy doing and just try to figure out how to spend my time doing things that I enjoy.","I like writing code. I like building product. I like making things that people like.","We created the 'Like' feature in FriendFeed because I realized that people wanted an easy way to let others know that they saw what their friends posted and appreciated it. Putting in those simple little gestures is very powerful.","The companies that are the most influential and most successful are the ones that care about impact and the influence they have on the world.","Google is about information and computers and making things really fast. Facebook is about the sharing and connections. These missions give these companies direction and motivation."],"Paul Butcher":["I believe the best influence you can have is not by being preachy, but by trying to live. For example, knowing you're not perfect, but trying to treat everyone kind and accepting everyone for who they are.","Being popular isn't everything; being true to yourself is!","Doing drama is a very welcome departure from comedy. Although I love doing both, I like to change it up a bit once in a while with roles in serious drama.","I do a lot of teen shows and voice over work for animation, so when I got the part in 'The Number 23,' it was really cool because now I get to be in a movie with Jim Carrey. Acting in this movie was really a learning experience for me.","The cast of 'Zoey 101' are like a family to me.","When I got a call to do the voice of Johnny in an episode of 'American Dad' titled 'I Can't Stan You,' it was a great opportunity to be a part of a really funny cutting-edge show on television. I really got into the character, and I was able to do some improvisation, which allowed me to mix in part of my personality into the script.","For 'Barnyard,' I did the voice of a 'chick,' which was really a blast because I had to manipulate my voice to another pitch.","I don't go to the mall a lot 'cause girls scream and run at me, and I get shy."],"Paul Butterfield":["I think I'm better than all the people who are trying to reform me.","They want to create rather than decimate.","A lot of people relate me to the blues but I don't think it's a hindrance at this point.

We are dependent on each other. And no matter what the issue of the day, whether it be softwood lumber, whether it be a war in Iraq, we need to continue to work together.","We are very grateful for what the Ontario provincial government is doing, and for cooperation from provincial and local police forces all across Canada.","I do want to try to put things in perspective today relative to the U.S.-Canada relationship. I would like to start by talking about how important this relationship is to the people of the United States.","When you think about the day-to-day, positive impact on the lives of U.S. citizens, there is no relationship that we have in the world that is more important than our relationship with Canada.","There is $1.4 billion a day in trade that goes back and forth across the border. That means millions of jobs and livelihoods for families here in Canada and for families in the United States.","We are also looking to Canada as we continue to integrate the North American energy market.","We get more oil from Canada than any country.","When I was Governor of Massachusetts, we worked to get Sable Island gas into New England.","This ability to have reliable sources of energy and a reliable transmission of energy here in North America is critical for both of us and for Mexico as we want to keep our economies growing.","I want you to know that, despite what you might read at times in the newspapers or see on the television news, we have actually been getting a lot of things done the last several months, the U.S.-Canada relationship.","The agreement to place the binational planning group at our new Northern Command was also signed in December.","We want to look at how we would respond because, as hard as we work to prevent terrorist attacks here North America, if we have a catastrophic terrorist attack, it is the military that is going to have to go in at the request of civilian authorities.","These are Canadian and United States intelligence and law enforcement offices who are working in teams and who are using good intelligence and good law enforcement to really stop the criminals and terrorists before they ever get to the border.","We believe, as the President has indicated, that this combination of a rogue state that possesses weapons of mass destruction and has known ties to terrorist organizations, is a grave threat to the people of the United States and to other countries around the world.","We saw when those World Trade towers came down what these terrorists will do.","We know that if al Queda or one of these terrorist organizations were to get a weapon of mass destruction from Iraq, that they would have no hesitation about using it to catastrophic consequences; the potential is for hundreds of thousands of casualties.","We need to defeat al Queda and other terrorist organizations.","I can tell you that the Canadian intelligence and law enforcement agencies have been providing outstanding co-operation with our intelligence and law enforcement agencies as we work together to track down terrorists here in North America and put them out of commission.","Another part of the global war on terrorism that Canada and the United States are working on together is in helping failed states, states like Afghanistan, where people have no voice.","Canada and the United States are also working at the World Trade Organization and in our own hemisphere with negotiations for a Trade Area of the Americas to try to help countries create a positive climate for investment and trade.","Then we can help these failed states turn around and give their people a better life. This, too, is a critical part of this global war on terrorism, and Canada and the United States are together.","This war in Iraq is part of a larger effort to remove this terrorist threat from the planet.","So we are disappointed that some of our closest allies, including Canada, have not agreed with us on the urgent need for this military action against Iraq.","But Canada remains a crucial partner in this global war on terrorism, and we are grateful for that. Canadian naval vessels, aircraft and military personnel continue anti-terrorist operations in the Persian Gulf.","Canada is preparing to play a major role in the continued stability and security of Afghanistan through ISAF.","The Royal Canadian Mounted Police and CSIS have provided extraordinary co-operation, as I mentioned earlier.","We will have a border that is open for business, open for tourism, open for legitimate travelers; but that is closed to terrorists and drug pushers and smugglers and others who seek to break the law.","Yet there is disappointment in Washington and in the United States that Canada is not supporting us fully.","Like Canada, we very much wanted the United Nations to be a relevant and effective body. But once those efforts failed, we no longer saw things from a multilateral perspective. For us, now, it is much more basic than that. It is about family.","We would be there for Canada, part of our family. That is why so many in the United States are disappointed and upset that Canada is not fully supporting us now.","Ironically, the Canadian naval vessels, aircraft and personnel in the Persian Gulf I mentioned earlier who are fighting terrorism will provide more support indirectly to this war in Iraq than most of the 46 countries that are fully supporting our efforts there.","We are at war to liberate Iraq, to protect the people of the United States and other countries from the devastating impact of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction being used by terrorists or the Iraqi government to kill thousands of innocent civilians.","Let me close as I did in Gander on September 11, 2002 when I went to that community to thank the people of Gander and the people of Canada for the overwhelming support and help that was given to us in the wake of those attacks on September 11, 2001.","We must also remember that our work is not done.","Much has been accomplished during the last year in the campaign against terrorism. This struggle will require vigilance, perseverance and sacrifice for many years to come."],"Paul Cezanne":["Genius is the ability to renew one's emotions in daily experience.","It's so fine and yet so terrible to stand in front of a blank canvas.","Keep good company - that is, go to the Louvre.","We live in a rainbow of chaos.","Art is a harmony parallel with nature.","Painting from nature is not copying the object; it is realizing one's sensations.","Pure drawing is an abstraction. Drawing and colour are not distinct, everything in nature is coloured.","Shadow is a colour as light is, but less brilliant; light and shadow are only the relation of two tones.","The day is coming when a single carrot, freshly observed, will set off a revolution.","With an apple I will astonish Paris.","If isolation tempers the strong, it is the stumbling-block of the uncertain.","A work of art which did not begin in emotion is not art.","The artist makes things concrete and gives them individuality.","Here, on the river's verge, I could be busy for months without changing my place, simply leaning a little more to right or left.","For an Impressionist to paint from nature is not to paint the subject, but to realize sensations.","Don't be an art critic. Paint. There lies salvation.","I ask you to pray for me, for once age has overtaken us, we find consolation only in religion.","The truth is in nature, and I shall prove it.","My nervous system is enfeebled, only work in oils can sustain me.","An art which isn't based on feeling isn't an art at all.","When I judge art, I take my painting and put it next to a God made object like a tree or flower. If it clashes, it is not art.","The most seductive thing about art is the personality of the artist himself.","Optics, developing in us through study, teach us to see.","It is impossible for emotion not to come on us in thinking of that time now flowed away.","I've come to the conclusion that it's not really possible to help others.","I paint as if I were Rothschild.","Painting is damned difficult - you always think you've got it, but you haven't.","The world doesn't understand me and I don't understand the world, that's why I've withdrawn from it.","People think how a sugar basin has no physiognomy, no soul. But it changes every day.","A puny body weakens the soul.","We must not be content to memorize the beautiful formulas of our illustrious predecessors. Let us go out and study beautiful nature.","I must be more sensible and realize that at my age, illusions are hardly permitted and they will always destroy me.","The clear French landscape is as pure as a verse of Racine.","I'll always be grateful to the public of intelligent amateurs.","There are two things in the painter, the eye and the mind; each of them should aid the other.","Two sittings a day of my models and I'm totally exhausted.","You say a new era in art is preparing; you sensed it coming; continue your studies without weakening. God will do the rest.","Is art really the priesthood that demands the pure in heart who belong to it wholly?","I allow no one to touch me.","I lack the magnificent richness of color that animates nature.","I am a pupil of Pissarro.","One does not substitute oneself for the past, one merely adds to it a new link.","The awareness of our own strength makes us modest.","The painter must enclose himself within his work; he must respond not with words, but with paintings.","Doubtless there are things in nature which have not yet been seen. If an artist discovers them, he opens the way for his successors.","I could paint for a hundred years, a thousand years without stopping and I would still feel as though I knew nothing.","I want to die painting.","I am more a friend of art than a producer of painting.","Tell me, do you think I'm going mad? I sometimes wonder, you know.","A thousand painters ought to be killed yearly. Say what you like: I'm every inch a painter.","I have nothing to hide in art. The initial force alone can bring anyone to the end he must attain.","My age and health will never allow me to realize the dream of art I've been pursuing all my life.","With a painter's temperament, all that's needed are the means of expression sufficient to be intelligible to the wide public.","Is it the factitious and the conventional that most surely succeed on earth and in the course of life?","I am the primitive of the method I have invented.","I have sworn to die painting."],"Paul Claudel":["All that passes is raised to the dignity of expression; all that happens is raised to the dignity of meaning.

But it wasn't until I started writing crime that things began to work for me.","There's a bunch of Stephen King books I love. 'Salem's Lot' was always one of my favourites. 'It.' 'Needful Things.'

It's hard to stay on top.","Having Wayne in town will be exciting enough.","I didn't spend a whole lot of time here, but I had the seven best years of my career in this city and having an attachment here 20-some odd years later is pretty special to me.","I went on and was still able to play some good hockey.","Anyone that coaches their son, you expect more out of your boy. I'm not talking about stats, but I expected him to be the hardest worker out there.","There are certain guys that think they know hockey because they follow it on the Internet.","Leadership is one of sports' intangibles.

But not everybody can say, 'Follow me.'","Outdoor hockey is what it is all about.","People ask me all the time now, what's the most memorable moment of your career? It's always the championships. The first goal, the 50th - it doesn't matter. It's always the championships.","I don't think longevity gets enough credit when you're talking about a player.","My mother passed away of complications of dementia. As you get older, it really makes you realize how many people are touched by this disease.","Before you become successful, you have to fall down on your face.","I was a natural skater, but I also took private lessons to enhance my skills.","There's only a couple stats that matter. No one cares how many blocked shots a guy has, how many hits.","That feeling in the dressing room after you win - nothing comes close to that. You can't get that in any other career. Maybe in the stock market back in the '80s when people were making tons of money, maybe they felt something similar. Maybe. But look at the market now. Nothing gives you that emotion like sports. Nothing. Am I wrong?","Sight is something you take for granted until you think you might lose it."],"Paul Conrad":["I've never seen bad drawing destroy a good idea. On the other hand, I've never seen a good drawing save a bad idea.","There is too much illustrating of the news these days.

There's a lot of money in weapons deals. We sell weapons, and our responsibility ends as soon as they leave the country; they're unpacked, and then before you know it, they're spread around the world.","Britain, along with the U.S.A., is war weary, and after the travesty of Iraq and Afghanistan, has grave misgivings in any future involvement in the Middle East. The ghost of Tony Blair and his single-minded determination to attack Iraq, at any cost, has cast a long shadow over British politics.

A system in which there is no countervailing power is a tyranny in which power is unconstrained and unaccountable.","Hillary Clinton, an agent for the Oligarchy, was defeated despite the vicious media campaign against Donald Trump. This shows that the media and the political establishments of the political parties no longer have credibility with the American people.","The Transatlantic and Transpacific Trade and Investment Partnerships have nothing to do with free trade. 'Free trade' is used as a disguise to hide the power these agreements give to corporations to use lawsuits to overturn sovereign laws of nations that regulate pollution, food safety, GMOs, and minimum wages.","Paul Krugman, a professor at MIT and a consultant to the IMF, the World Bank, the United Nations, and the Trilateral Commission, is certainly a member of the establishment.","The road to economic well-being is to reward productive economic activity and to provide a moderate and predictable growth of money to finance real economic growth without reigniting the fires of inflation.","Elephants are magnificient creatures.","Many foolish people believe that nuclear war cannot happen, because there can be no winner. However, the American war planners, who elevated U.S. nuclear weapons from a retaliatory role to a pre-emptive first strike function, obviously do not agree that nuclear war cannot be won.","We need a memorial day to commemorate the victims of neoliberal globalization.","Marx and Lenin were ahead of their time. Marx wrote before offshoring of jobs and the financialization of the economy. Lenin presided over a communist revolution that jumped the gun by taking place in a country in which feudal elements still predominated over capitalism.","Despite massive evidence to the contrary, libertarians hold tight to their romantic concept of capitalism, which, freed from government interference, serves the consumer with the best products at the lowest prices.","Under Reagan's policies, inflation and nominal GNP growth shriveled much faster than predicted, throwing off government revenue estimates and resulting in budget deficits.","The neoconservative ideology supports American financial and military-political imperialism or hegemony.","Western capitalism is a looting mechanism. It loots labor. It loots the environment, and with the transpacific and transatlantic 'partnerships,' it will loot the sovereign law of countries.","Marxism is a success because it fuses the two inconsistent strains in Western thought - moral skepticism and moral indignation - and makes them complements in the attack against existing society.","When I met with Chinese policymakers in 2006, I advised them that there was a limit to how long they could rely on the U.S. consumer market, as jobs offshoring was destroying it.","Clearly America is exceptional in its immorality, lack of human compassion, and disrespect for law and its founding document.","War is the only destination to which Washington can lead.","Governments unaccountable to law are tyrannies, whatever they might call themselves, no matter how exceptional and indispensable they declare themselves to be.","In the United States, journalists receive awards for lying for the government and for the corporations.","Clearly what differentiates the U.S. from other countries is the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution defines us as a people. Without the Constitution, we would be a different country. Therefore, to lose the Constitution is to lose the country.","Marxism is the only doctrine that both satisfies the demands for progress and provides a safe outlet for moral expression in a skeptical age.","I have argued that the Soviet story is one of the interaction of speculative excess or utopian aspirations with refractory reality.","The human capital of most macroeconomists, heavily invested in demand management, was wiped out by the policy failures of the 1970s.","The U.S. is ruled by private interest groups and by the neoconservative ideology that history has chosen the U.S. as the 'exceptional and indispensable' country with the right and responsibility to impose its will on the world.","There is no independent American print or TV media.","Both political parties, Republicans and Democrats, are dependent on the same private interest groups for campaign funds, so both parties dance to the same masters.","As the U.S. is import-dependent, this will translate into higher domestic prices.","As the dollar's exchange value declines, so will the value of dollar-denominated financial instruments, regardless of how many bonds the Federal Reserve purchases.","Few, if any, corporations absorb the full cost of their operations. Corporations shove many of their costs onto the environment, the public sector, and distant third parties.","Progressives regard government as the white knight that protects the public from the greed of capitalists. If only.","The public subsidies provided to miners, loggers, and ranchers are as extravagant and as harmful to the public interest as the subsidies that the Federal Reserve and Treasury provide to the 'banks too big to fail.'","The Western media is a Ministry of Truth that operates full-time in support of the artificial existence that Westerners live inside The Matrix where Westerners exist without thought. Considering their inaptitude and inaction, Western peoples might as well not exist.","In the Matrix in which Americans live, nothing is ever their fault.","Once a country descends into evil, it doesn't emerge.","The great problem with corporate capitalism is that publicly owned companies have short time horizons. Unlike a privately owned business, the top executives of a publicly owned corporation generally come to their positions late in life. Consequently, they have a few years in which to make their fortune.","By offshoring the production of their products, U.S. corporations transferred technology, physical plant, and business knowhow to China.","Offshoring manufacturing jobs left Americans with fewer high-value-added, well-paid jobs, and the U.S. middle class downsized. Ladders of upward mobility were taken down.

They are too busy representing a handful of private interest groups such as the financial sector, the military/security complex, and agribusiness.","The way to attack the entitlements problem is to bring the jobs home. This could be done by taxing corporations according to the location, domestic or foreign, at which they add value to their product.","If all countries are exceptional, the word loses its meaning.","A government that cannot survive truth and must resort to stamping out truth is not a government that any country wants.","The office of U.S. Trade Representative was created in order to permit corporations to write law that serves only their interests.","There are no free financial markets in America or, for that matter, anywhere in the Western word, and few, if any, free markets of any other kind.","The financial markets are rigged by the big banks, the Federal Reserve, and the Treasury in the interests of the profits of the few big banks and the dollar's exchange value, which is the basis of U.S. power.","The Soviet Union was a partial check on capitalist looting in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. However, with the Soviet collapse, capitalist looting intensified during the Clinton, Bush, and Obama regimes.","Corporations and Wall Street in pursuit of short-term profits have given the economy away.","The American people and the entire world need to understand that the threat to life on earth resides in Washington and that until Washington is fundamentally and totally changed, this threat will remain as the worse threat to life on earth.","It is impossible to work out a reduction in nuclear threat as long as one side is going all out to demonize the other.","The propagandistic American 'media' and the crazed neoconservatives have set humanity on the path to destruction.","I have come to the conclusion that capitalism is successful primarily because it can impose the majority of the costs associated with its economic activities on outside parties and on the environment.","In the U.S., society and the environment have to pick up the tab produced by capitalist activity.","The unambigious fact is that U.S. capitalism is a mechanism for looting the many for the benefit of the few.","If it turns out that global warming and ocean acidification are consequences of capitalism's carbon-based energy system, the entire world could end up dead from the external costs of capitalism.","If you want to learn real economics instead of neoliberal junk economics, read Michael Hudson's books.","Trump has more understanding and insight than his opponents realize. For a man such as Trump to risk acquiring so many powerful enemies and to risk his wealth and reputation, he had to have known that the people's dissatisfaction with the ruling establishment meant he could be elected president.","I did not think the Oligarchy would allow Trump to win. However, it seems that the oligarchs were deceived by their own media propaganda.","The Federal Trade Commission is supposed to enforce U.S. anti-trust law. Instead, the federal agency routinely violates U.S. anti-trust law by permitting monopoly concentrations of business interests.","Because of the failure of the federal government to enforce federal law, we now have 'banks too big to fail,' unregulated Internet monopoly, and the evisceration of a dispersed and independent media.","If the Obama regime gave a hoot about 'humanitarian crisis,' the Obama regime would not have orchestrated humanitarian crisis in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and Yemen.","There was no terrorism in the Middle East until Washington brought it there with invasions, bombings, and torture.","The offshoring of American jobs by global corporations and the deregulation of the U.S. financial system have resulted in American economic failure.","Peace is costly to the profits of the military/security complex. Washington's gigantic military and security interests are far more powerful than the peace lobby.","When America's Newspaper of Record is nothing but a propaganda ministry, what is America?","The foreign policy of the United States rests entirely on propagandistic lies.","The neoconservative doctrine declares that it is the principal goal of U.S. foreign policy to prevent the rise of any country that would have sufficient power to serve as a check on American unilateralism. This neoconservative doctrine puts Russia and China in Washington's crosshairs.","God made a mistake when he gave to humans, infected as they are with evil, jurisdiction over Earth. He should have given jurisdiction to animals.","Looting is the only way left for the Western financial system to make money.","For a country to be looted, its people's voice must be silenced.","Putin responds to threats, to illegal sanctions, and to incessant propaganda with statements that governments need to respect each other's national interests and to work together for common benefit. No politician in the West speaks in this way.","I have no sympathy for debunking human achievements that, in the end, gave ordinary people liberty.","Beginning with the Clinton Administration and rapidly accelerating with the George W. Bush and Obama regimes and Tony Blair in England, the U.S. and U.K. governments have run roughshod over their accountability to law.","Everyone who ever trusted Washington has been betrayed. Possibly there is an exception somewhere, but the betrayals are vast and are sufficient in number to define Washington as the least trusted entity on the earth.","Clearly the climate is changing, whether caused by CO2 emissions or some other cause.","The planet is being polluted with many forms of wastes.","On one hand, our food is polluted with herbicides and on the other hand by antibiotics. And then we have hormones and pesticides.","Capitalists make money by exploiting labor and by externalizing the costs of the wastes produced by the productive process by imposing the wastes on the environment.","It is the nature of government and of technology to establish control.","People everywhere face the threat of control by government and technology.","As truth is Washington's worst enemy, everyone associated with the truth is Washington's enemy.","In 21st century America, capitalism has been unfettered from the regulations that democratized it and made it serve society.","When I was a young man, an individual with one million dollars was very rich. Anyone with a few millions more was considered richer than rich.","There is no reason for a person to have thousands of millions of dollars.","Every public institution in the United States and most private ones are corrupt.","Law is just one public institution, but it is a cornerstone of society. When law goes, everything goes.","Few Americans other than the One Percent have a stake in the American economic and political system.","Globalism is a scheme for impoverishing First World labor and taking power and influence from the hands of the many and putting them in the hands of the few.","The champions of globalism are the champions of America's destruction.","I have come to the conclusion that the West is a vast lie machine for the secret agendas of vested interests."],"Paul Crouch":["God as my witness, may He strike me down if this allegation is true.","Regarding comments attributed to me in the Los Angeles Times - allegedly made on a bus trip from Germany to Holland in 1998 - I emphatically denounce such comments as false.","The statements of four witnesses of unquestioned integrity, traveling with me that day, attest that such comments were never made and confirm that it simply did not happen."],"Paul Cullen":["In a very simple sense I want everything that's in a work to be there for the reason that it's needed. It's not an ornamentation. It's not there because I thought it looked nice but because it has to be there.","It's a matter of reducing the work to its very simplest possible state, eliminating all of the things that lead away from the guts of the work, the thing the work is really about. Anything that's there must build towards its over-all organization and meaning."],"Paul D. Boyer":["Mountain hikes instilled in me a life-long urge to get to the top of any inviting summit or peak.","An unexpected benefit of my career in biochemistry has been travel.","A painstaking course in qualitative and quantitative analysis by John Wing gave me an appreciation of the need for, and beauty of, accurate measurement.","During my early years at Minnesota I conducted an evening enzyme seminar.","The excitement of vitamins, nutrition and metabolism permeated the environment.","In marked contrast to the University of Wisconsin, Biochemistry was hardly visible at Stanford in 1945, consisting of only two professors in the chemistry department.","I am told that I had a bad temper, and remember being banished to the back hall until civility returned.","The experience reminds me of a favorite saying: Most of the yield from research efforts comes from the coal that is mined while looking for diamonds.","The geographical isolation and lack of television made world happenings and problems seem remote.","More by example than by word, my father taught me logical reasoning, compassion, love of others, honesty, and discipline applied with understanding.","Family trips to Yellowstone and to what are now national parks in Southern Utah, driving the primitive roads and cars of that day, were real adventures.","If our society continues to support basic research on how living organisms function, it is likely that my great grandchildren will be spared the agony of losing family members to most types of cancer.","Her death contributed to my later interest in studying biochemistry, an interest that has not been fulfilled in the sense that my accomplishments remain more at the basic than the applied level.","It wasn't until late high school and early college that I gained enough size and skill to make me welcome on intramural basketball teams.","I participated on debating teams and in student government, and served as senior class president.","It was always assumed that I would go to college.","The Brigham Young University (BYU) campus was just a few blocks from my home and tuition was minimal.","I have a tendency to be lucky and make the right choices based on limited information.","Concentrated serum albumin fractionated from blood plasma was effective in battlefield treatment of shock.","This led to the discovery that long chain fatty acids would remarkably stabilize serum albumin to heat denaturation, and would even reverse the denaturation by heat or concentrated urea solutions.","The war project at Stanford was essentially completed, and I accepted an offer of an Assistant Professorship at the University of Minnesota, which had a good biochemistry department."],"Paul Daniels":["You'll like this, not a lot, but you'll like it.","I am still working on patter and presentation.","Even though the vast majority of my work was outside television, the amount of creation and inventing that went into the TV shows was non stop and, unknown to me, a great strain.","I don't particularly have any magical ambitions, but then, I never did. I just enjoyed the game.","I don't get many hecklers now but answering them is an art form in itself.","When people say to me don't the years go fast I have to be honest and say that whereas I don't realise where they go in the long term, I pack so much into a year it seems to take forever."],"Paul Dano":["In tragedy, it's hard to find a good resolution; it's not black and white: it's a big fog of gray.","I'd always been fascinated by people who allow themselves to be so rude and irritated and foul-mouthed and hostile, but usually you can sense there's something vulnerable beneath them - a shield they use to protect that vulnerable side. Finally, when they expose that soft spot, it's kind of touching.","I don't like to spend a lot of money on haircuts: I'll sometimes grow my hair and get an acting job and get them to cut it for free. I think for a lady, though, it's okay to spend a lot on a haircut.","I love Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath and Guns N' Roses and AC/DC.","The world of the homeless is a tough and interesting world.","'Little Miss Sunshine' was really important to me.","I am baffled by good writing.","I do think the first time you read a script, that gut response is very important, and that probably plants a seed that continues to blossom throughout the whole experience.","I love cereal. I eat several bowls a day, mostly a few late at night.","People have asked me about playing outsiders. I don't consider myself an outsider. Maybe that's why I'm interested in that. I'm not really sure.","You look at the part in '12 Years A Slave,' you finish that script - I mean, it's a powerful story. You go, 'Man, I have to play a bad character in this.' And then you go, 'Well, do I want to play a bad character and contribute to a good story?'","Everything you do, every experience that you have, enlightens you a little bit or worsens you.","One of my favorite films is 'Dumb and Dumber.' I'd love to do some really silly comedy someday.","I started acting pretty young, so I haven't had too many odd jobs. But I used to sell candy out of my locker in middle school.","Being actors is a strange job.","I feel like, once you're doing a job, you shouldn't talk about it.","There's a lot of people that I would love to work with. There's a lot of different kinds of parts I wanna play. As your career progresses, you hope that you get some more opportunity or some more choice.","I think that one of the strangest things about being an actor is, it's almost freelance work.","It's a funny thing. You sort of never figure it out with acting. You're always learning.","I tore my ACL playing basketball.","I mean, to feel in good hands as an actor... it's the best feeling.","George C. Scott, man, was a powerful dude.","One thing you notice is, there's a lot of people with raw talent, and then there's people who take that talent and work hard.","Have I seen any plays that I've been in? Uh, you know, might be a little weird.","I like characters that make me feel challenged and sort of inspired.","I really don't want to go to work every day convincing myself of what I'm saying. I want the material to make me a better actor; then I try to return the favor to the material.","As an actor, the toughest thing is being subject to circumstance. Meaning: What scripts are out there that are available?","I think 'American Pie' is great.","There's that thing that if you want to have any kind of lasting love, I think you have to love the whole person and not just the parts of them that you choose.","I'm not a person who needs to chit-chat between takes by any means.","With somebody like Harrison Ford, they're so commanding and confident, and you know, he does have a certain power or charisma, and those are things that are sort of ineffable.","I think the idea is to try and understand everything about the characters and where the character is coming from, from their point of view, why they say what they do. And not, 'Oh, but I would never say that. Why does the character say that?' But then making it as personal as possible.","Homeless people really upset me when I was little. A lot of kids have this reaction, but I would get really worried or sad or concerned or cry.","I think was overly empathetic for a while in my life.","I don't want my learning curve to be stunted by just all of a sudden doing work all the time and not being careful about the work that I'm doing.","You try to get to know your character as best as you can before you start filming - what's written and not written.","I've definitely been in ruts, and I think having some kind of perseverance is important.","I like movies a lot, and I feel really excited when I see a movie that moves me the right way.","I've seen people, where if they have to wait around the set for three hours, and they call you at the wrong time, and they're not ready for you, some people don't like that.","I love filming in New York. I love New York movies, too. I just like it when people can take New York and make it their own, because there are so many different New Yorks.","I sort of grew up doing theater. And that's how I got into film, actually.","Theater is hard.","Certainly, being on stage is a rush.","I don't know that praise is always a good thing.","Nobody is a perfect actor.","I think it is important to make sure that I have my real life as well, because Hollywood can certainly seem like an alternate reality sometimes.","When I'm not excited, it makes acting very hard for me.","I'm very low-maintenance.","I don't like tight pants on guys.","I don't normally like getting dressed up, but when I go to events, I like to look put together. I've got to say, getting in a nice suit feels good.","I don't really know what kind of actor I am.","Some projects go as you hope or imagine, and some change or reveal themselves in a different way; it depends.","One of my favorite things I read was John Steinbeck's journals while he was writing 'East of Eden,' which was so cool.","The idea of writer's block or not having inspiration is totally terrifying to me.","The hardest thing about working with your partner is that the work starts to become first.","The way Hollywood works, you're never sure if their first thought is to make a great film and honor the material or just another business property.","In 'There Will Be Blood,' my character was someone who was an actor himself almost. He had a rehearsed quality about him. He was a performance artist in a way.","It's hard to talk about acting because I don't think it's quite as explicit as a lot of people might think. And that's probably the best thing about it.","I've definitely had mentors, whether parents or friends or actors who I like.","I grew up in Manhattan, and now I live in Brooklyn.","I like the idea of finding parts that I know I can do but I don't totally understand them right away.","A lot of people think I must be weird because of the films I've done. I get that.","New York is kind of a mythological city in may ways.","I'm a sucker for period pieces. There is always great opportunity for research and to delude yourself into feeling like you are in a different time and place.","I know I am always pumped, as an audience member, to go and see a Western.","I think that the Western went away for a while because part of its function was that it used to be America's action film.","In life, you have to keep certain parts of yourself in check because you want to be a decent human being. But one of the guilty pleasures of acting is that sometimes you get to let a little something out that you don't in life because it's not right.","I know I'd like to direct a film at some point, and maybe I'll write it.","I'm a private person, but I don't feel afraid to walk out of my door or anything. I get recognised occasionally, but not overwhelmingly so.","I want to do some bigger films, so long as there's some sort of exciting creative element or a good filmmaker behind them.","There are maybe 100 actors I look up to, but my first two favourite actors were Dustin Hoffman and Jack Nicholson.","I don't have any tattoos.","'Looper' was a wonderful script. Rian Johnson is the real deal and a really talented filmmaker.","As an actor, I always feel you basically have to be able to delude yourself.","As people, no matter what we are doing, your whole body is living and breathing.","To be called a genius at 17 or 18 years old can sometimes cause arrested development.","Sometimes we fall in love with the idea of a person and have trouble seeing the real thing.","I guess sometimes fear is a good thing. It's a really good motivator.","I remember going to the theatre when I was little and the lights going down and just getting really scared about what was going to happen up there.","The only constant I can find is hard work.","The whole being-in-a-room interview thing, at a junket or a film festival, is very inhuman. You meet the person, have five or 10 minutes to talk, and it's not like a conversation.","When you repeat yourself so many times, even if you're speaking the truth, the repetition starts to feel false. Sometimes, you just feel like the words you're speaking, even if they once had meaning, have lost it. And that makes you feel kind of silly.","I know an actor who would play one type of part but could never get cast as tough. Once he got cast as tough, as a cop, he only got offered cop roles. It's a funny business in that regard. It's all about perception.","I'd love to do a really broad comedy at some point.","On 'There Will Be Blood,' I was cast at the last minute. I had 3 and a half to 4 days to get ready for the first day. I just went for it, threw myself in there and gave it everything I had. That was just guts and instinct, not a lot of preparation.","I've been fortunate to work with several actors and directors who I look up to, and learned from each of them.","Your director is your main support - actors don't generally give each other advice on set, not in my experience.","At the heart of drama is conflict.","One of my favorite films is 'Dumb and Dumber.'","When I'm not acting, I like to go home and be really normal. So I usually grow out my hair until I get the next part.","I do like the idea of consequence and how our actions play themselves out, but I am completely scared of knowing what the future would be like. I would never go near a fortune teller, even though it's probably not even real. I just don't wanna know.","I feel like I have to be responsible for what I'm participating in or putting out into the world.","I go down to the dive bar around the corner when I go out. I don't go to the showbiz parties.","People think memorizing lines is hard, when that's the last thing you worry about. You get that done, and then you've got to worry about the internal stuff, which is the challenging part.","I used to write a lot of songs. I was an English major in college. I was a deluded poet for a year. Totally deluded.","Films can be entertaining without shying away from exploring something. They can be magical and have fantasy, but also can have enough reality that you can be really emotionally invested.","I approach every role from scratch.","I can obviously relate to a character who is an artist, because the creative process is a big part of my life.","Listening to hard rock on the subway doesn't work for me, especially modern hard rock. Driving in L.A. helped me to understand the appeal of that music.","Robert De Niro's sort of like a surfer: he doesn't really force anything. So if he catches the wave, or something spills out - to watch a guy be a force at what he does. He has a good worth ethic.","I would not take a girl to a club on a Thursday. I would not take her to a really noisy, swanky restaurant.","Spring and fall in New York are the best seasons here to get out and about. I like the little park in Dumbo between the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridge. I like Prospect Park.","I like a restaurant called Bruci, and there's some really nice people who work there and good food. They change their menu a lot, so maybe that's what keeps me coming back. I never know what I'm going to get.","Let's say honorary favorite New Yorker is John Lennon, and favorite real New Yorker is Biggie, because he's the best.","My first paying job might have been doing a play, actually. My mom paid me to dress up as a flounder at my sister's 'Little Mermaid' - themed birthday party when I was little.","When my girlfriend's away, I cook a big vat of meaty pasta and sauce and eat that for about a week. Then I eat out the rest of the time. When she's home, we eat at home probably twice a week. I chop, she cooks.","I'm not a big shopper. I'm a pretty simple dresser, and that's not my pleasure go-to thing, looking for clothes.","I volunteered at a homeless shelter in preparation for 'Being Flynn,' and when I'm walking along the Bowery, that's the first thing that comes to mind. That's a nice memory.","It's a lot of fun to be a part of films that you don't exactly know how they're going to turn out.","I like listening to my playlist on the iPod. I don't want radio with commercials.","I think control is a two-way street; sometimes people want to control things to keep them safe if they are afraid of life.","I went to private school in Manhattan, and at a young age, they made us do public speaking. For some reason, I was good at standing in front of the class and speaking.","Even when I'm alone, my life revolves around film. I think that's why I live in New York, not L.A., where it's so concentrated.","Sometimes I think your intellect can get in your way as an actor or an artist. When you come from a world of improv and comedy, you're able to let it flicker and fall out.","To be running away from explosions with Harrison Ford, you know, that's pretty great.","The better the acting is, the harder it is to see what the process is.","I love Brooklyn; it's a part of who you are.","I think you sometimes have to go hit rock bottom before you can grow and rebuild as a person.","I always ask for more takes. I like doing takes, so I'll do as many as I can."],"Paul Darrow":["I think the intelligent thing about it is that you have to carefully listen to it all to grasp it, and because I'm not in every scene - colossal disappointment to everybody that it may be - I'm not getting the full picture here today while recording it.","To tell you the truth, it's a complex piece, so I can't really answer your question at present.","If he is a ghost, then it's very disappointing for me, because he is banished in the story, and that could mean that he won't be coming back, and that would be terrible, wouldn't it?","Also, from a technical point of view, as you're standing in front of a microphone all day, it's quite a good idea that I should play a laid back sort of character because if he was too frenetic, I'd be exhausted by lunch!","He's psychologically damaged, I suppose, if you stand back and look objectively at him, but then, who isn't?","He has all those different aspects to him, so I can more or less decide as a performer how I'm going to deliver a line in a particular scene, or play a particular scene in total."],"Paul Davies":["Is there anything science should not try to explain? Science is knowledge and knowledge is power - power to do good or evil. Sometimes ignorance is bliss.","General relativity is the cornerstone of cosmology and astrophysics. It has also provided the conceptual basis for string theory and other attempts to unify all the forces of nature in terms of geometrical structures.","It will be in the convergence of evolutionary biology, developmental biology and cancer biology that the answer to cancer will lie. Nor will this confluence be a one-way street.","A universe that came from nothing in the big bang will disappear into nothing at the big crunch. Its glorious few zillion years of existence not even a memory.","My feeling is that scientific method has the power to account for and interlink all phenomena in the universe, including its origin, using the laws of nature. But that still leaves the laws unexplained.","The birth of science as we know it arguably began with Isaac Newton's formulation of the laws of gravitation and motion. It is no exaggeration to say that physics was reborn in the early 20th-century with the twin revolutions of quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity.","The origin of life is one of the great outstanding mysteries of science.","Science, we are repeatedly told, is the most reliable form of knowledge about the world because it is based on testable hypotheses. Religion, by contrast, is based on faith. The term 'doubting Thomas' well illustrates the difference.","In science, a healthy skepticism is a professional necessity, whereas in religion, having belief without evidence is regarded as a virtue.","For me, science is already fantastical enough. Unlocking the secrets of nature with fundamental physics or cosmology or astrobiology leads you into a wonderland compared with which beliefs in things like alien abductions pale into insignificance.","Scientists have no agreed theory of the origin of life - plenty of scenarios, conjectures and just-so stories, but nothing with solid experimental support.","A permanent base on Mars would have a number of advantages beyond being a bonanza for planetary science and geology. If, as some evidence suggests, exotic micro-organisms have arisen independently of terrestrial life, studying them could revolutionise biology, medicine and biotechnology.","Searching for alternative life on Earth might seem misconceived, because there is excellent evidence that every kind of life so far studied evolved from a common ancestor that lived billions of years ago. Yet most of the life that exists on Earth has never been properly classified.","When I was a student, the laws of physics were regarded as completely off limits. The job of the scientist, we were told, is to discover the laws and apply them, not inquire into their provenance.","The language of chemistry simply does not mesh with that of biology. Chemistry is about substances and how they react, whereas biology appeals to concepts such as information and organisation. Informational narratives permeate biology.","The way life manages information involves a logical structure that differs fundamentally from mere complex chemistry. Therefore chemistry alone will not explain life's origin, any more than a study of silicon, copper and plastic will explain how a computer can execute a program.","Most research into life's murky origin has been carried out by chemists. They've tried a variety of approaches in their attempts to recreate the first steps on the road to life, but little progress has been made. Perhaps that is no surprise, given life's stupendous complexity.","Cancer is such a ruthless adversary because it behaves as if it has its own fiendishly cunning agenda.","Cancer cells come pre-programmed to execute a well-defined cascade of changes, seemingly designed to facilitate both their enhanced survival and their dissemination through the bloodstream. There is even an air of conspiracy in the way that tumours use chemical signals to create cancer-friendly niches in remote organs.","In the frantic search for an elusive 'cure,' few researchers stand back and ask a very basic question: why does cancer exist? What is its place in the grand story of life?","Astonishingly, in spite of decades of research, there is no agreed theory of cancer, no explanation for why, inside almost all healthy cells, there lurks a highly efficient cancer subroutine that can be activated by a variety of agents - radiation, chemicals, inflammation and infection.","If we do discover more than one type of life on Earth, we can be fairly certain that the universe is teeming with it, for it would be inconceivable that life started twice here but never on all the other earth-like planets.","The vast majority of terrestrial species are in fact microbes, and scientists have only begun scratching the surface of the microbial realm. It is entirely possible that examples of life as we don't know it have so far been overlooked.","No planet is more earth-like than Earth itself, so if life really does pop up readily in earth-like conditions, then surely it should have arisen many times right here on our home planet? And how do we know it didn't? The truth is, nobody has looked.","Astronauts have been stuck in low-Earth orbit, boldly going nowhere. American attempts to kick-start a new phase of lunar exploration have stalled amid the realisation that NASA's budget is too small for the job.","Clearly, some creative thinking is badly needed if humans are to have a future beyond Earth. Returning to the Moon may be worthy and attainable, but it fails to capture the public's imagination. What does get people excited is the prospect of a mission to Mars.","Perhaps the best motivation for going to Mars is political. It is obvious that no single nation currently has either the will or the resources to do it alone, but a consortium of nations and space agencies could achieve it within 20 years.","Imagine a civilisation that's way in advance of us wants to communicate with us, and assist us in our development. The information we provide to them must reflect our highest aspirations and ideals, and not just be some crazy person's bizarre politics or religion.","To expect alien technology to be just a few decades ahead of ours is too incredible to be taken seriously.","It is possible that a scientific discovery will be made that humans will later regret because it has awful consequences. The problem is, we probably would not know in advance and, once the discovery is made, it cannot be undiscovered.","Cosmologists have attempted to account for the day-to-day laws you find in textbooks in terms of fundamental 'superlaws,' but the superlaws themselves must still be accepted as brute facts. So maybe the ultimate laws of nature will always be off-limits to science.","An argument often given for why Earth couldn't host another form of life is that once the life we know became established, it would have eliminated any competition through natural selection. But if another form of life were confined to its own niche, there would be little direct competition with regular life.","Should we find a second form of life right here on our doorstep, we could be confident that life is a truly cosmic phenomenon. If so, there may well be sentient beings somewhere in the galaxy wondering, as do we, if they are not alone in the universe.","So how can we test the idea that the transition from nonlife to life is simple enough to happen repeatedly? The most obvious and straightforward way is to search for a second form of life on Earth. No planet is more Earth-like than Earth itself, so if the path to life is easy, then life should have started up many times over right here.","Scientists are slowly waking up to an inconvenient truth - the universe looks suspiciously like a fix. The issue concerns the very laws of nature themselves.","Traditionally, scientists have treated the laws of physics as simply 'given,' elegant mathematical relationships that were somehow imprinted on the universe at its birth, and fixed thereafter. Inquiry into the origin and nature of the laws was not regarded as a proper part of science.","We will never fully explain the world by appealing to something outside it that must simply be accepted on faith, be it an unexplained God or an unexplained set of mathematical laws.","Man-made computers are limited in their performance by finite processing speed and memory. So, too, the cosmic computer is limited in power by its age and the finite speed of light.","Cancer touches every family in one way or another. As other diseases are brought under control, cancer is set to become the number one killer, and is already in epidemic proportions worldwide.","Although the elusive 'cure' may be a distant dream, understanding the true nature of cancer will enable it to be better controlled and less menacing.","Things changed with the discovery of neutron stars and black holes - objects with gravitational fields so intense that dramatic space and time-warping effects occur."],"Paul Desmond":["I was overlooked long before anyone knew who I was.","I would also like to thank my father who discouraged me from playing the violin at an early age.","We used to get on planes, and they'd ask who we were, and we'd say, 'The Dave Brubeck Quartet', and they'd say, 'Who?' In later years they'd say, 'Oh', which amounts to the same thing.","Writing is like jazz. It can be learned, but it can't be taught."],"Paul Di Filippo":["The three touchstones that woke Buddha up - sickness, old age, and death - are a pretty good place to start when crafting a tragic tale. And if we need to get more specific: heartbreak, destruction, miscomprehension, natural disasters, betrayal, and the waste of human potential.","Every new generation of SF writers remakes cyberpunk - a genre often laced with dystopian subtexts - in its own image.","Once anthropology and geology had opened up the pre-recordkeeping darkness of humanity's long, slow, sustained infancy as suitable grounds for speculation, writers began trying to imagine human existence as it must have been with only stone-age technology.","Only a minority of science fiction dystopias attempt to plumb the real existential roots of oppression, the flaws in humanity's nature that undermine our best attempts at organizing ourselves into social units.","One posthumous measure of a person's life is how often you imagine his impossible return to deal with some event he never lived to encounter. You picture his reactions, his advice, his sage commentary and humorous asides. For instance, I think about Mark Twain's hypothetical take on current events several times a week.","'James and the Giant Peach' magnificently starts out Dahl's career as a blithe and droll Bad Uncle corrupter and affirmer of youth. Its influence can be subsequently traced down the decades in everything from Maurice Sendak to Lemony Snicket to J. K. Rowling.","Certainly the highest posthumous praise that can be conferred upon any writer is the assertion that his or her writing permanently altered the literary landscape for the better, opening new textual doors and engaging new readers. That the author's oeuvre was essential and irreplaceable and transformative.","Roald Dahl pioneered a new kind of literature for youngsters, one that dispensed with cant and solemnity, favoring anarchy and joy over duty and humbuggery while acknowledging that oftentimes no good deed goes unpunished. But ultimately, it was his sheer joie de vivre that carried the day.","Generally speaking, by the time a subculture such as steampunk secures the attention of major media, resulting in extensive coverage of the craze, said phenomenon is already on the way out.","Stephen King consummately honors several traditions with his rare paperback original, 'Joyland.' He addresses the novel of carny life and sideshows, where the midway serves as microcosm, such as in those famous books by Ray Bradbury, Charles Finney and William Lindsay Gresham.","The sentient beast has long been a staple of fantasy fiction and its antecedents in myth and folktale.","It's certainly a cliche to remark that a nonfiction book 'reads just like a novel,' but in the case of Jonathan Eig's 'The Birth of the Pill,' I have no other recourse, since his narrative is full of larger-than-life characters sharply limned and embarked on fascinating doings, their story told in sprightly visual fashion.","Critics, at least generally, want to regard works of fiction as independent entities, whose virtues and failures must be reckoned apart from the circumstances of their creation, and even apart from the intentions of their creator.","Jeff VanderMeer's fiction has always been entrancingly, engagingly, enthusiastically weird, a winning combination of mimesis and the fantastical that privileges neither component: perhaps the very definition of that mode categorized as the 'New Weird' and exemplified most famously by the groundbreaking work of China Mieville.","Generational change within a genre is hard to parse while it's happening. Only in retrospect can the passing of the baton from ancestors to progeny be clearly discerned.","Science fiction is a literary field crowded with strong opinions, and no SF novelist delivered himself more memorably of his views - on politics, sexuality, religion, and many other contentious topics - than Robert Heinlein.","The constituents of tragedy may be universally acknowledged, easily invoked and deeply felt, but the elements of comedy are, I think, more widely variable from person to person.","Quite often, intent on conveying how things can go wrong for a culture (science fiction) or an individual (horror) or all of magical creation (fantasy), works of fantastika often preclude comedy, because humor gets in the way of messages of doom or struggle.","Consensus wisdom has it that all modern commercial fantasy novels fall into two camps: those derived from J.R.R. Tolkien and those derived from Mervyn Peake. The 'Lord of the Rings' template or the 'Gormenghast' mold.","The SF genre, of course, is really an organically evolved, marketplace-determined, idiosyncratic grab bag of themes and signifiers and characters and icons and gadgets, some of which hew to the realistic parameters and paradigms embraced by science, others of which partake more of fantasy and magic.","Science offers no brief for the telekinetic powers of Darth Vader and hardly any greater justification for the faster-than-light travel that makes his empire possible. And yet what is 'Star Wars' if not pure quill SF?","I suspect that authors who start their careers writing for an adult audience - and who eventually produce a young adult novel or two - are more common than authors who begin by writing for young adults and who then gravitate toward composing something for an adult audience.","Any debut novel is usually a case of spitting into the wind - or, just maybe, casting your bread upon the waters. Without an established audience in place, first-time authors have to hope for resonant word of mouth and a receptive reviewer or three.","Writers begin changing the instant they append 'The End' to a novel. Readers begin changing the moment they encounter that same phrase. And even the novels themselves, through the strange transmutations of time and shifting tastes and mores, exhibit changes as we look backward upon them, acquiring retroactive meanings and tonalities.","The impossibility of a sequel ever recapturing everything - or anything - about its ancestor never stopped legions of writers from trying, or hordes of readers and publishers from demanding more of what they previously enjoyed.","Blending consensus historical events and personages with imaginary occult forces is a strong recipe for counterfactual storytelling goodness that combines the best of two worlds: resonant history with wild-eyed fantasy.","War has always been a part of science fiction. Even before the birth of SF as a standalone genre in 1926, speculative novels such as 'The Battle of Dorking' from 1871 showed how SF's trademark 'what if' scenarios could easily encompass warfare.","The lives of most authors - even, or perhaps especially, the great ones - are necessarily a catalogue of tedious inwardness and cloistered composition. Globe-trotting Hemingways and brawling Christopher Marlowes are the exception, not the rule.","Writing one's first novel, getting it sold, and shepherding it through the labyrinths of editing, production, marketing, journalism, and social media is an arduous and nerve-wracking process.","Thomas Pynchon surely inaugurated or crystallized a new genre in 1963 when he published 'V.' The seriocomic mystery or thriller with one foot set in the present and one in various historical eras received its postmodern baptism from Pynchon.","The way I was educated, maybe from just inhaling something in the air back then, I grew up believing that E. B. White occupied the apex of essay writing.","The science-fictional motif of lethal, infectious information - bad memes - is a fascinating one, with an extended history. One of the earliest instances is Robert W. Chambers's 'The King in Yellow' from 1895. Chambers's conceit is a malevolent play: read beyond Act II, and you go mad.","Sometimes magnificent visual art takes root in the humblest of soils. Advertisements painted on old barns, tattoos, fruit crate labels, hot rod embellishments - all these media and many other non-galleried forms have hosted and fostered esthetic delights that satisfy any rigorous definition of art.","There must be a rule of thumb in pop-culture archaeology that states that the allure of any topic is inversely related to its assigned importance in the affairs of humanity. The more trivial the subject, the dearer it is to most of its partisans and the more worthy of scholarship. The smallest things in life often mean the most to people.","Everyone can guess what 'Corn Flakes' tastes like, even if you've never had them. But what, pray tell, does 'High School Musical' or 'Spider-Man' cereal possibly taste like? In this late era, we have reached the ultimate deracination between product image and what actually sits on our spoon.","Just as our solar system has a certain idiosyncratic assortment of planets and moons, different from any neighboring system yet categorically equivalent, so each distinct period of human history might have special qualities and individuals, characteristics and events, yet still be essentially akin beneath the surface to all the others.","The entire Internet, as well as the types of devices represented by the desktop computer, the laptop computer, the iPhone, the iPod, and the iPad, are a continuing inescapable embarrassment to science fiction, and an object lesson in the fallibility of genre writers and their vaunted predictive abilities.","It was not until the appearance of cyberpunk in the 1980s that SF began to grapple in a broadly meaningful way with the reality of computers as something other than giant mainframes tended by crewcut IBM nerds.","For every reader and writer of steampunk fiction, there are probably hundreds or thousands of other activists who gleefully embrace some non-written manifestation of the steampunk ethos.","The juggernaut that is steampunk, like Dr. Loveless's giant mechanical spider in the 1999 film version of 'The Wild, Wild West,' seems capable of crushing all naysayers.","It is truly bracing and instructive to contemplate the End Times - at least at safe remove, in the pages of fiction - especially as the world beyond our hearths churns and convulses unknowably, yet perhaps just short of ultimate disaster.","Of the birth of subgenres, there is no end. They arise like bubbles full of miraculous hopes and potentials from the Planckian foam of the canon, inspiring writers new and established alike.","More than we sleep, play, or make love, we work. Yet despite - or perhaps because of - this dominant daily grind, much of our literature is biased toward other pursuits.","It's a heartening fact about the human race that utopian fiction precedes dystopian fiction in the evolution of literature.","Every Luke Skywalker needs his Darth Vader.","Steampunk, the repurposing of Victorian culture and technology for contemporary fun and profit, is so ubiquitous - in media, books, fashion, music, cosplay, and maker culture - that we tend to imagine its superficial aspects are all that define it.","Technically and logically speaking, actual Victorian science fiction writers cannot be dubbed 'steampunks.' Although they utilized many of the same tropes and touchstones employed later by twenty-first-century writers of steampunk, in their contemporary hands these devices represented state-of-the-art speculation.","The term 'steampunk' itself, now a badge of honor, began as a putdown, a joke. But like 'Big Bang' in cosmology, the diss became the standard.","Ribofunk indicates a focus on biology as the upcoming big science in the way that physics was for the last 50 or 100 years. If you look for a biological thread throughout science fiction, you can find it, but it's a very small percentage of the total. That's been changing in the last few years.","The advent of AIDS circa 1980 has really forced medicine and biology to take enormous steps just for sheer survival. The same way war propels hard technology, AIDS has created wartime conditions in the field of biology that will have all sorts of spin-offs.","I think humanity is not wise enough to know what genotype or somatype is going to be the most successful or the most fit - simply because we're not fully in control of our environment.","You could engineer a human to survive the greenhouse effect because you think that's what's going to happen, and then all of a sudden the glaciers are creeping down on you."],"Paul Dinello":["I felt like there was a certain standard that we held 'Strangers' to, so I think about that whenever I work on something.","Any filmmaker who has translated some personal vision into a film that actually gets shot and distributed is wildly successful. Congratulations! Anything after that is gravy.","It's never easy getting an independent film made and distributed - even when it's easy.","I don't think any of us think of ourselves as artists or actors - clowns, we'll accept that label."],"Paul Dini":["Batman is dark and moody and spooky and, in some cases, methodical.","When it's only you that you can rely on, you're surprised at the resilience you have.","You have to be kind to yourself to survive in the world.","You have to remember, when someone hurts you, that you are so much more than what they took from you.","If everybody's a winner, nobody has to try very hard.","In those times when a kid first tries to express themselves creatively, it sets them on a different path. Sometimes, that path can be really wonderful and can lead to a career doing some of the things you love. I also think that the price on that is a certain amount of alienation or distance created between a lot of the people around you.","The old Rankin-Bass animated specials seemed to exist in a loosely shared reality, which is what attracted me to them. Santa, Snow Miser, Rudolph, Frosty, even the Easter Bunny seemed to be on nodding acquaintance with each other, even if only in cameo appearances in each other's cartoons.","Creativity, for a lot of young people, is a coping mechanism. It's the only place they feel comfortable. It's the only time they feel like they're being heard or can make a difference, is if they can go into a room and do a drawing or go to a garage and play a song or retreat to this world.","Mr. Freeze is motivated by different things. He doesn't really have that much of an axe to grind with Batman. Batman is an irritation and an impediment to him, not an enemy that he hates. He doesn't have the hatred that the Joker has for Batman.","One Thanksgiving weekend, I had a lost weekend at a friend's place with 'Grand Theft Auto.'","There was a time I was willing to be a clown for people who I felt were the perfect person for me.","To overcome any form of adversity, to not give up, to not give up on yourself, your dreams, to not sequester yourself away from people - that's the most important thing to do with your life.","I take inspirations from newspaper strip cartoonists who look for ways of expanding their characters' worlds once they have established the initial concept of their strips.","You can have villains like the Penguin, who strut around in a tuxedo with an umbrella, and Poison Ivy and all of the fantastic stuff she does, but unless there's a bit of a human in there, and unless there's a credible threat, then Batman himself doesn't work.","For years, humorous characters in cartoons have been almost exclusively male.","If the opportunity came my way, if somebody wanted me to look over a script or sit in a room in sort of like a brainstorming session... I would certainly be open for that.","The Joker is a tremendous vehicle for talented actors. Cesar Romero's was a bubbly, lunatic criminal. Nicholson did him as a vain, preening manipulator. Heath's performance of the Joker was remarkable, too. His was a low-simmering crazy street clown. Joker can be played all these ways, and they're all true.","I remember when I saw 'The Dark Knight' movie, and I was sitting there watching it, and there actually came one or two places where I had trouble divorcing myself from the reality of the locations because it was filmed in Chicago, and I know that city quite well.","I always think of the Joker as the ultimate bully. Nothing he says is funny except to him.","Mickey Mouse did not stay the little squeaky guy in 'Steamboat Willie.' He went on to have many different versions.","As cool as it is to be Spider-Man at times, there's also a price to pay for that - and he has to learn to balance things out.","What makes Batman and what makes other superheroes work is the myth that when life is at its lowest, and when you need a hero, a hero swings down and helps you.","I'm not saying I talk to cartoon characters all the time, but the characters are very real to me. In a very non-insane way.","There's a little bit of Sid and Nancy to the Joker and Harley look, which I always felt would not be a bad look if they were in a live-action movie.","We're all painfully aware of how suddenly violence can occur, how crippling it is, and how survivors have to find a way back from that.","My story is just my story, and it's not nearly as traumatic as some.","There's a sort of eternal, indefinable 20th century quality to 'BTAS.' We never really pegged the decade, but it's anytime in the 20th century, so I often harkened back to things from the '40s or '50s.","I was writing a script about the Joker menacing a regular person who had strayed into his path, and I needed to give him a gang of henchmen to work with him. The idea occurred to me, let's put in a female henchperson, because that seemed like a fun variation on the regular big thug guys.","When you do an animated series and add characters who are not from the canon, you really have to win over the hardcore fans.","In every story I've written with Batman, there's an element of justice - you never want to have the story end on a defeatist or a cynical note.","I've always felt in my own small, little way that if I could just write a story where it works out well, where the scales of justice are balanced, then that's something that I do really love to see in the world.","If you let tragedies stop you along the way, then you're never going to grow as a person.","You don't have to limit yourself or feel that you've been limited by an act of cruelty.","'Boo & Hiss' has been a passion project of mine for a couple of years. I was intrigued with the idea of what would happen in a classic cartoon predator/prey relationship if the predator - in this case, a cat - got to finally do in his adversary only to have the mouse return as a ghost and bedevil the cat.","I really didn't have any plan for her other than the henchgirl role, who was better at getting laughs out of the other gang members than the Joker was. I gave her the name Harley Quinn because I thought Harley was a fun name for a girl, and a lot of 'Batman' character names have a bit of a pun to them, like E Nygma.","There's something very, very liberating about Harley Quinn. Much more so than a character like Catwoman or Poison Ivy. Those are great characters. But then again, those characters are more of the femme fatale and the temptress roles.","Wonder Woman is out there very much defending the right and being strong and being a positive role model.","Quite often in comic book movies, very good actresses are relegated to being the girlfriend or the helper or the sidekick or something.","I was one of those goofy kids whose year narrowed down to focus on Christmas from about September on. I guess I was like Ralphie in 'A Christmas Story,' in that I would get swept up into the anticipation of the holiday, watching the lights go up, hearing the songs in the stores, getting special Christmas issues of comics and all that.","As much as I liked the build-up to Christmas, the week after always socked me with the blues.","As much fun as it is gaming, I have so much to do that I've had to get away from them. I still enjoy them. When I go to a friend's house and they have a game on, I'll happily join in and play.","To some degree, I don't think 'Batman' works in a completely modern city; I think Gotham has be reflective of his personality and those of his enemies.","When you're writing for a game - even if you're using very well known characters like Batman and his villains who lend themselves to many different interpretations - you have to keep in mind that you're writing for a different medium. Things are a bit more straightforward than it is for a feature film or a TV show.","With 'Wonder Woman,' I did one story with Alex Ross, and I had a lot of fun doing it, but I don't think I could do a 'Wonder Woman' book on a regular basis, because there's so much history there and so much mythology and everything.","I felt that, with 'Zatanna,' I had a chance to do a story about a strong, driven woman.","It's a lot of fun to identify with a character who lives by their own rules.","There are some short stories in R. Crumb comics that are just wonderful and touch me in ways no other comics do.","Most female characters have either been the temptress - like a Betty Boop type - or the victim - like an Olive Oil type.","I remember very vividly going to school, being very happy, and then just having guys there who were just out to make my life miserable.","It's wrong to become a bully yourself or to take it out on other people, and in my case, I just retreated to a place where I was safe. And that place was my imagination, books, and television.","Characters do change over time; there are surprises, role reversals, and things like that.","I'm a very visual thinker, so the characters are running through my head, doing what they're doing when I'm writing them. And there'll be moments where I'll just kind of throw a look off to the side as if I'm talking to one of the characters. It's always been something that I've had with me since I was a little kid.","I look at the Marvel movies and the DC movies and various creators' creations, and I think, you know, that's really pretty cool.","I have played games like Angry Birds and, you know, Plants vs. Zombies and things like that just for fun on the phone and everything.","I think you have to serve a lot of masters when you're doing a video game: you're not just telling a linear story or doing something that's all action.","If we made the 'Batman' games more realistic, you'd have to be Bruce Wayne for half the game, counting his money and dating supermodels.","With 'Tower Prep,' Cartoon Network wanted to go into a new area where no other kids' programming was going. There were a lot of kids' sitcoms on the air, but they wanted to really go with more of like an adventure/drama feel.","I'll continue doing 'Jingle Belle' as long as I've got a good story for her.","As far as doing a TV special, I would have to be in control of it. I'd want my own team of animators to work on it.","As much as I love elements of Spider-Man's past, I don't really want to go back in and retell the Gwen Stacy and Green Goblin story in animation just so I can do my take on it. I don't want to redo the first 'Spider Slayer' story.","There's a different energy to Spider-Man than there is to Batman.","Batman is pretty much a self-trained guy. I think it would be fun to do a character like Superman or Captain Marvel or maybe Green Lantern, somebody who's got a completely different resource for fighting crime and fighting villains.","'Batman' is pretty much real world-centric.","I've always liked the Krampus character, and I've always been fascinated with him, especially the tradition that he was such a part of the holiday season in Europe, in Germany, Austria, northern Italy, various other places.","One of the things I've learned from animation is that some guys are really good at writing, some guys are really good at design, some guys are really good at directing. It's almost like working in a band - not everybody plays every instrument.","I have a great fondness for any character I work on. Whether it's somebody like Batman or Harley Quinn or whatever character I'm writing, I just really enjoy the heck out of it, and I try to do the best job I can with it.","'Jingle Belle' spins out of my love for just sitting down and reading a good, fun Sunday morning comic strip panel.","If 'Jingle Belle' harkens back to anything, it's sort of the Harvey Comics. Not really 'Archie,' but more of a teenage version of what Harvey Comics would have become, with the type of fantasy wonderland of her and her various friends.","Jeph Loeb has been great to work with, and he's been really supportive of some really bizarre ideas I've had.","If your child has something creative they really want to do, it's up to you, their parent, to help make that happen.","I grew up loving cartoons, comics, magic, and writing.","Encourage your kids to be creative. When you see them tracing a character from TV or a comic, say something like, 'That's nice. Now how about you create a character yourself?' Keep kids curious and excited about creating.","Jim Henson once allowed me to visit the Muppets on set and spent an entire day showing me how he and the other puppeteers performed Kermit and all the characters! After that, I was lucky enough to work with both George Lucas and Steven Spielberg on many fun animation projects and learned so much from them.","'Batman Beyond' started because we were tossed a curve, because the higher ups at Warner Bros. wanted a different take on him.","I think that when you've got a world in which it's plausible to have a guy dressed as a giant bat and fight evil clowns and other nightmarish freaks, I think the world has to be visually a little more arresting than a regular world.","That's the thing about writing for a lot of the villains is that, as a writer, you kind of have to put the best part of your own personality aside and instead focus on whatever little strange quirks you may have in your personality.","Hugo Strange is interesting in the sense that he's a master manipulator. He doesn't really engage Batman in any sort of physical way. His weapon is his mind, and he's very incisive and clever: he reads people and sizes them up almost instantly.","I wouldn't call the Joker exactly easy to write.","Nobody loves a good 'Batman' story more than I do.","You don't have a Batman without Bruce Wayne. Batman is the edge or scary image for Bruce to use.","Bruce Wayne needs a sense of humor to do his job. Batman, for a very long time, was going to a very dark place.","I like artists to have some freedom.","Batman doesn't use a gun. When Bruce Wayne thinks he had to resort to a street thug's level to defend himself and the girl he was rescuing, he decides he can't be Batman anymore.","Initially, kids are attracted to Superman as a hero because he can take care of problems and still appear as friendly as your dad.","Batman's got this whole cloaked 'man of mystery' thing around him and represents a wish fulfillment. He's more driven than Superman yet is also very human.","In 'Batman Beyond,' Terry McGinnis has the responsibility of protecting Gotham City, as well as maintaining a home and social life. He's also got a single mom and a pesky younger brother, which young kids will relate to.","We had established Harley Quinn as an accomplice to the Joker who was also crushing on him and found herself in the middle of this weird relationship being at the beck and call of his every whim. We wanted to stretch her and make her a stronger character, so to have her leave him and go off on her own was a story I wanted to tell for a while.","I looked at comics like a buffet table, where you take a little bit of something and leave the other stuff behind.","Without Wonder Woman, there would be no Black Canary; without a Superman, there would be no Flash. They all come from that.","Everybody looks back on what they studied and what they grew up with.","Kids love the Hulk, but they're not really sure: 'Is he a monster or is he a hero?'","I think nobody knows more about comic book characters than Seth Green. I thought I knew a lot, and he leaves me in the dust.","The agents of S.M.A.S.H. are the most powerful team in the Marvel universe in terms of muscle power.","I remembered what it was like: the weirdness, being the odd man out, trying to make my way around campus, and trying to figure out who my friends would be, who to steer clear of. I wrote it all down in a fanciful way - the feelings of alienation, the feelings of uncertainty, of being away from home for the first time.","As a writer, every time I create a character, I try to go for something to captivate the audience in some way. It's also an extension of how the audience would like to see themselves.","A lot of times, female characters - particularly the villains - come off as very one-dimensional. They get the short shrift in that they're only given the snappy comeback, or they're relegated to a very stereotypical role. I want to know what's driving them - that's what's really interesting.","I get it, cops deal with a lot, but at the same time, we crave justice, and we do want to believe things are going to be all right.","I was working in cartoons. I could go to Comic-Con, buy the Hal Jordan ring, I could buy animation cels, but at the end of the day, I come back to an empty apartment. I had a life that was only around me, and when I was broken, my world was broken.","I'm always thinking about stories and ideas, and I have a few I'd like to actively pursue, but as much as I love them, I love the process of creation, and I want to go on and create things for myself, and create new things."],"Paul Dirac":["God used beautiful mathematics in creating the world.","Pick a flower on Earth and you move the farthest star.","I should like to suggest to you that the cause of all the economic troubles is that we have an economic system which tries to maintain an equality of value between two things, which it would be better to recognise from the beginning as of unequal value.","It seems that if one is working from the point of view of getting beauty in one's equations, and if one has really a sound insight, one is on a sure line of progress.","In science one tries to tell people, in such a way as to be understood by everyone, something that no one ever knew before. But in poetry, it's the exact opposite.","The shortage of buyers, which the world is suffering from, is readily understood, not as due to people not wishing to obtain possession of goods, but as people being unwilling to part with something which might earn a regular income in exchange for those goods.","I do not see how a man can work on the frontiers of physics and write poetry at the same time. They are in opposition.","The methods of theoretical physics should be applicable to all those branches of thought in which the essential features are expressible with numbers.","The fundamental laws necessary for the mathematical treatment of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty lies only in the fact that application of these laws leads to equations that are too complex to be solved.","There is in my opinion a great similarity between the problems provided by the mysterious behavior of the atom and those provided by the present economic paradoxes confronting the world."],"Paul Downs Colaizzo":["There's so much to argue about. That was the goal with 'Really Really.' Somebody asked me once, 'How should I feel when I leave?' and I said, 'Hopefully, you're talkative.' I don't really care if you're happy or sad or loved it or hated it or hate me. The goal is that you have something to say, that you have a response.","What I learned was that we Millennials possess one factor that supposedly sets us apart from those who came before us. Is it incredibly clear skin, since most of us took Accutane at some point? No. The recurring description of our generation is 'entitled.'","A lot of us are secretly scared, for whatever reason, and so we get in our own way. But if you really want something, you have to ask for it.","Going on unemployment was a total low point for me, but it was also the point when I promised myself I'd write every day from 9 to 5. I tried to make the most out of every situation that came along.","People in their early 20s are not often considered the target demographic for new plays; musicals have had much more success in exploring that coming-of-age period of life.","I never leave a piece of theater that I love and say, 'That was a good point; They made a good point.' I leave, and I feel something.","Going on unemployment was a total low point for me, but it was also the point when I promised myself I'd write every day from 9 to 5.","The South has a way of worshipping appearances - the suburbs are all about presentation and amazing flowers and a beautiful yard and dinner parties that impress people and having the Christmas lights just right.","I'd say there are two kinds of theater: one you end with an answer, one you end with a question.","I think the hardest thing I've had to learn is that just because people might speak a certain way in real life doesn't mean it's engaging in the theater."],"Paul Dudley White":["A vigorous five-mile walk will do more good for an unhappy but otherwise healthy adult than all the medicine and psychology in the world.","We know from our clinical experience in the practice of medicine that in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, the individual and his background of heredity are just as important, if not more so, as the disease itself.","I wish we could do something useful with tobacco - like making fertilizer out of it."],"Paul E. Jacobs":["Without the materials needed to manufacture new technologies, our future innovators will not have the resources necessary to tackle the biggest challenges we face in today's society. I strongly believe in being a positive and creative force in the protection and enhancement of the local and global environment.","There's always competitors out there, one way or another.","Competition is good.","The cellphone is humanity's biggest platform. If we can't use it to change education or health care, then shame on us.","Highly skilled immigrants are critical to innovation and are important contributors to economic growth in the United States."],"Paul Eenhoorn":["From an actor's point of view, if you are watching something, and you see improv, you know it. Because of your experience, you just bloody know that wasn't written.","I've been on television since I was about 17. I had opportunities - one major opportunity I blew in my 20s. Once I started down this pathway, it was a case of not letting anyone stop me. Not my wife, not my family. It was getting too late to give it a small percentage. I had to give it one hundred percent.","I was in a band till I was about 17; then I went to television, and I spent seven years doing that. When I came to Seattle, I started to audition for things. The passion's always there, and that's what's been the hard thing: to fit that passion into a normal life. You can't do it. You can't have a normal life and pursue this dream.","I've always felt I had the talent. I've done a lot in my life. I've written, been in bands, done live TV for a network in Perth. I'm well-trained when it comes to being on a set, which gives you freedom.","I did some stage when I was a kid, around 16 or so. I was living in Melbourne and had a band. I was quite young. We weren't very good. Then I found a band in Perth. We played around for three years. We're in the 'History of Rock'N'Roll,' a book about Perth music.","I still miss music and singing. One day, I'm going to sing with a big band.","I've been writing music since I was a teenager. I play keyboards. I'm not much of a player, but I can write. That will come along. I'd like to do a musical.","Interestingly, I'm more closed on set than I am off set. On set, I'm closed. I don't want input. I want to concentrate on what I'm doing with this other person. But outside of that, I'm open. I'm everybody's friend, unless they don't like me.","I walk into a scene, and I do the scene. That's my job. I don't have an objective. I have the words, and I have whoever I'm playing with.","I'm patient when it comes to my career, which is unlike me, but there are no stars in my eyes. I make where I go. It's that sort of thing.","I'm self-opinionated, and I have a sense of self. I can be brutal with agents and have been.","There still seems to be a lack of film for the baby boomer generation, if you'd like to call it that. And I think 'Martin Bonner' showed what's possible. Later in life, when you've been working at something for a long time, to actually get some kudos for what you do is wonderful."],"Paul Eldridge":["Praises for our past triumphs are as feathers to a dead bird.","With the stones we cast at them, geniuses build new roads with them.","Jealousy would be far less torturous if we understood that love is a passion entirely unrelated to our merits.","Man is ready to die for an idea, provided that idea is not quite clear to him.","If we were brought to trial for the crimes we have committed against ourselves, few would escape the gallows.","In the spider-web of facts, many a truth is strangled.","Reading the epitaphs, our only salvation lies in resurrecting the dead and burying the living.","There are those whose sole claim to profundity is the discovery of exceptions to the rules.","History is the transformation of tumultuous conquerors into silent footnotes.","We endeavor to stuff the universe into the gullet of an aphorism."],"Paul Elmer More":["We are born knowing nothing and with much striving we learn but a little; yet all the while we are bound by laws that hearken to no plea of ignorance, and measure out their rewards and punishments with calm indifference.","In such a state, humility is the virtue of men, and their only defense; to walk humbly with God, never doubting, whatever befall, that His will is good, and that His law is right."],"Paul Eluard":["A woman is more beautiful than the world in which I live; and so I close my eyes.","Elephants are contagious.","Hope raises no dust."],"Paul Emsley":["I'm always worried about the sitter - are they cold, are they hot, are they comfortable? Photography today is so accurate and so good that it's really so much easier just to take photographs and work from them.","As an artist, you do understand you're never going to please everybody.","Critics have a job to do. I understand that. It's not just to criticize. They're trying to interpret art for the public."],"Paul Engle":["Without vision you don't see, and without practicality the bills don't get paid.","Contrary to slanderous Eastern opinion, much of Iowa is not flat, but rolling hills country with a lot of timber, a handsome and imaginative landscape, crowded with constant small changes of scene and full of little creeks winding with pools where shiners, crappies and catfish hover.","For my Oxford degree, I had to translate French and German philosophy (as it turned out, Descartes and Kant) at sight without a dictionary. That meant Germany for my first summer vacation, to learn the thorny language on my own.","The sharpest memory of our old-fashioned Christmas eve is my mother's hand making sure I was settled in bed.","Touch was important. The evening of the Third of July we would go around the neighborhood and look at the fireworks others had bought, taking them out of the brown paper sack and handling them cautiously as if they were precious stones. There was envy when we saw sacks with more in them than we had.","All families had their special Christmas food. Ours was called Dutch Bread, made from a dough halfway between bread and cake, stuffed with citron and every sort of nut from the farm - hazel, black walnut, hickory, butternut.","The corncob was the central object of my life. My father was a horse handler, first trotting and pacing horses, then coach horses, then work horses, finally saddle horses. I grew up around, on, and under horses, fed them, shoveled their manure, emptied the mangers of corncobs.","Poetry is ordinary language raised to the Nth power. Poetry is boned with ideas, nerved and blooded with emotions, all held together by the delicate, tough skin of words.","Every Christmas should begin with the sound of bells, and when I was a child mine always did. But they were sleigh bells, not church bells, for we lived in a part of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where there were no churches.","Verse is not written, it is bled; Out of the poet's abstract head. Words drip the poem on the page; Out of his grief, delight and rage.","A barn with cattle and horses is the place to begin Christmas; after all, that's where the original event happened, and that same smell was the first air that the Christ Child breathed.","Wisdom is knowing when you can't be wise.","But maybe it's up in the hills under the leaves or in a ditch somewhere. Maybe it's never found. But what you find, whatever you find, is always only part of the missing, and writing is the way the poet finds out what it is he found.","I wanted to write poetry almost a little more than I wanted to eat.","When your first marriage goes into tragedy, you become very battle-scarred... I even thought of suicide. Luckily, I had known some happy marriages.","To eat in the same room where food is cooked - that is the way to thank the Lord for His abundance.","I knew about holiness, never having missed a Sunday-school class since I started at four years. But if Jews were also religious, how could our neighbor with the grease-grimy shirt use the word 'damn' about them?","Corncobs are the greatest fire-making tinder.","I had been warned about Jews by my gentile friends - they did terrible things with knives to boys.","The years rolled their brutal course down the hill of time. Still poor, my clothes still smelling of the horse barn, still writing those doubtful poems where too much emotion clashed with too many words.","Human life is too difficult for people.","Soldiers of the American Revolution fought that 18th century war with heavy muskets. In the early 20th century, we kids fought it every Fourth of July not only with exploding powder and shimmering flares, but with all of our senses.","Our small ears never had such a workout as on the Fourth of July, hearing not only our own bursting crackers but also those of our friends, and often the boom of homemade cannon shot off by daring boys of 16 years, ready to lose a hand if it blew up.","I can still remember the feel in my hand of that most wonderful American coin ever minted, a nickel with a buffalo on one side and the head of an Indian on the other. That nickel was a daily proof of our country's past. Bring it back!","Has the painter not always gone to an art school, or at least to an established master, for instruction? And the composer, the sculptor, the architect? Then why not the writer? Good poets, like good hybrid corn, are both born and made.","There must be an alternative between Hollywood and New York, between those two places psychically as well as geographically. The University of Iowa tries to offer such a community, congenial to the young writer, with his uneasiness about writing as an honorable career, or with his excess of ego about calling himself a writer.","When I took over the Writers' Workshop, it was one little class and there were eight students. All of them, brilliantly untalented... I had an absolute vision after the first workshop meeting.","All poetry is an ordered voice, one which tries to tell you about a vision in the un-visionary language of farm, city, and love.","I grew up in the prolonged survival of the great age of the horse, with harness and saddle and sleigh bells and horse pictures, not as antiques but the facts of our lives.","Other families bought automobiles; we had a horse-headed hitching post in front of our house and drove horses.","I began to write poetry in high school, and would ride miles over sandy roads in the fine hills around Cedar Rapids, repeating the lines over and over until I had them right, making some of the rhythm of the horse help.","You come to know the aches and vanities and tastes and intrigues of an entire neighborhood at a drug store.","I have published in 'The New Yorker,' 'Holiday,' 'Life,' 'Mademoiselle,' 'American Heritage,' 'Horizon,' 'The Ladies Home Journal,' 'The Kenyon Review,' 'The Sewanee Review,' 'Poetry,' 'Botteghe Oscure,' the 'Atlantic Monthly,' 'Harper's.'","I have lectured at Town Hall N.Y., The Library of Congress, Harvard, Yale, Amherst, Wellesley, Columbia, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Louisiana State University, Colorado, Stanford, and scores of other places.","The way to praise a poet is to write a poem."],"Paul Epworth":["Pop music has greater power to change people and to affect people because it's a universal language. You don't have to understand music to understand the power of a pop song.","One of the funny things of being a producer, you have these fleeting, intense relationships with people, and they go off to global megastardom, and you don't see them.","Every musical scene has a cycle."],"Paul Erdos":["My brain is open.","A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems.","God may not play dice with the universe, but something strange is going on with the prime numbers.","Television is something the Russians invented to destroy American education.","There are three signs of senility. The first sign is that a man forgets his theorems. The second sign is that he forgets to zip up. The third sign is that he forgets to zip down.","Property is a nuisance.","I hope we'll be able to solve these problems before we leave.","Finally I'm becoming stupider no more."],"Paul Farmer":["The biggest public health challenge is rebuilding health systems. In other words, if you look at cholera or maternal mortality or tuberculosis in Haiti, they're major problems in Haiti, but the biggest problem is rebuilding systems.","You can't have public health without working with the public sector. You can't have public education without working with the public sector in education.","But if you're asking my opinion, I would argue that a social justice approach should be central to medicine and utilized to be central to public health. This could be very simple: the well should take care of the sick.","Since I do not believe that there should be different recommendations for people living in the Bronx and people living in Manhattan, I am uncomfortable making different recommendations for my patients in Boston and in Haiti.","The poorest parts of the world are by and large the places in which one can best view the worst of medicine and not because doctors in these countries have different ideas about what constitutes modern medicine. It's the system and its limitations that are to blame.","Anywhere you have extreme poverty and no national health insurance, no promise of health care regardless of social standing, that's where you see the sharp limitations of market-based health care.","For me, an area of moral clarity is: you're in front of someone who's suffering and you have the tools at your disposal to alleviate that suffering or even eradicate it, and you act.","So I can't show you how, exactly, health care is a basic human right. But what I can argue is that no one should have to die of a disease that is treatable.","I mean, everybody should have access to medical care. And, you know, it shouldn't be such a big deal.","It is clear that the pharmaceutical industry is not, by any stretch of the imagination, doing enough to ensure that the poor have access to adequate medical care.","If you look at people who seek a lot of care in American cities for multiple illnesses, it's usually people with a number of overwhelming illnesses and a lot of social problems, like housing instability, unemployment, lack of insurance, lack of housing, or just bad housing.","We've taken on the major health problems of the poorest - tuberculosis, maternal mortality, AIDS, malaria - in four countries. We've scored some victories in the sense that we've cured or treated thousands and changed the discourse about what is possible.","But as for activism, my parents did what they could, given the constraints, but were never involved in the causes I think of when I think of activists.","Civil and political rights are critical, but not often the real problem for the destitute sick. My patients in Haiti can now vote but they can't get medical care or clean water.","I'm not an austere person.","Some people talk about Haiti as being the graveyard of development projects.","You can't have public health without a public health system. We just don't want to be part of a mindless competition for resources. We want to build back capacity in the system.","The essence of global health equity is the idea that something so precious as health might be viewed as a right.","I don't know much about climate change. But I'm pretty sure we better figure out what to do to lessen its impact - at least its health impact - and that's not going to happen unless you have a lot of young talent interested in these topics.","Everybody should be interested in access to primary and secondary education for everybody.","I recommend the same therapies for all humans with HIV. There is no reason to believe that physiologic responses to therapy will vary across lines of class, culture, race or nationality.","The only way to do the human rights thing is to do the right thing medically.","I can't think of a better model for Haiti rebuilding than Rwanda.","Again, conventional Catholicism does not much appeal to me.","At the same time, it is obvious that clinicians in Haiti are faced with different, and, in fact, greater, challenges when attempting to treat complications of HIV disease.","I critique market-based medicine not because I haven't seen its heights but because I've seen its depths.","I mean we grew up in a TB bus and I became a TB doctor.","I think we will see better vaccines within the next 15 years, but I'm not a scientist and am focused on the short-term - what will happen in the interim.","I would say that, intellectually, Catholicism had no more impact on me than did social theory.","I'm one of six kids, and the eight of us lived for over a decade in either a bus or a boat.","I've been impressed, over the last 15 years, with how often the somewhat conspiratorial comments of Haitian villagers have been proven to be correct when the historical record is probed carefully.","In fact, it seems to me that making strategic alliances across national borders in order to treat HIV among the world's poor is one of the last great hopes of solidarity across a widening divide.","The human rights community has focused very narrowly on political and civil rights for many decades, and with reason, but now we have to ask how can we broaden the view.","The thing about rights is that in the end you can't prove what should be considered a right.","If any country was a mine-shaft canary for the reintroduction of cholera, it was Haiti - and we knew it. And in retrospect, more should have been done to prepare for cholera... which can spread like wildfire in Haiti... This was a big rebuke to all of us working in public health and health care in Haiti.","One of the things we have to acknowledge is that if you look at Haiti, many billions of dollars have gone into development aid there that have not been effective.","I've been working in Haiti 28 years - I thought I'd sort of seen it... I've gone through a number of coups, the storms of 2008, I thought, you know, that I'd seen things as bad as they were going to get, and I was wrong.","If you look just at the decades after 1934, you know it's hard to point to really inspired and positive support from outside of Haiti, to Haiti, and much easier to point to either small-minded or downright mean-spirited policies.","I think that looking forward it's easy to imagine more constructive help for Haiti.","The idea that because you're born in Haiti you could die having a child. The idea that because you're born in you know Malawi your children may go to bed hungry. We want to take some of the chance out of that.","Haiti is always talking about decentralization and nothing has been so obvious, perhaps a weakness, as the centralized nature of Haitian society as being revealed by the earthquake. I mean, they lost all these medical training programs because they didn't have them anywhere else.","We have to design a health delivery system by actually talking to people and asking, 'What would make this service better for you?' As soon as you start asking, you get a flood of answers.","I feel it's part of my job to make the problems of the poor compelling.","What the American public thinks is very important to the future of global health. Many people are moved by the idea that there is unnecessary suffering in the world, and we could do a lot to stop it. We have the technologies necessary to stop most of the suffering."],"Paul Feig":["For years, it's driven me crazy that women don't have better roles, especially in comedies. I know so many funny women but I always felt... misogynist streak is too strong a term - but a dismissiveness.","You just have to be classy at the end of the day. That doesn't mean you can't go with a midnight blue tux. And if you can find a deep red tux that looks classy and classic, I think you can pull it off.","Throughout my teens, I just wanted to go somewhere I could wear a Donald Duck pin and no one would care.","I love funny people, and when I'm with funny people, or people who are amusing in their weirdness, I love it. Because that to me is funny, as opposed to someone who stops and says, 'Hey let me tell you a joke.'","Where there seems to be a difference between guys being nuts and women being nuts is that guys are much more open in calling each other on stuff; lots of insults and dirty names. Whereas women will talk frankly and honesty, but there also seems to be more passive aggressiveness.","The more suits I owned, the more I realized the best besuited look a man can achieve comes from a harmony of three details: fabric, construction, and fit. If the suit fits you like a glove and it's well made, you simply feel better about everything in life when you're wearing it.","As far I'm concerned, being an adult is way more fun than being a kid. But then I was a kid who wanted to be an adult. I'd watch shows like 'Bewitched' and see Darren come home and mix a martini and I'd go, 'That looks awesome! I want to do that!'","You want a happy ending, but not such a ridiculous happy ending that it doesn't mean anything to anybody.","One of the biggest things you have is your reputation and your reputation with knowing what's good and what's not good.","Hey, I'm like the Wayne Gretsky of the entertainment biz - I have other people do my dirty work while I skate around and get to be a nice guy. What can I say? I'm a coward.","So many stars who have shows are intimidated by having people around them be funnier than them. It's always the unsuccessful ones. Look at Seinfeld - he's great because he let everyone be hilarious.","Getting away from a white or light colored tuxedo shirt is always a little dangerous. Certain staples shouldn't be mixed with. Light pink or blue is not bad, but again, you're just breaking from a classic.","Forty is the line of demarcation that says you're an adult now. You're an adult, so don't pretend you're a kid anymore.","Many Republicans have always reminded me of professional W.W.F. wrestlers. They come into the ring all pumped up and acting like they're invincible and that they're going to destroy their opponent. Then they get hit once and fall down and roll around in agony and suddenly seem immobilized by pain, calling for the ref to intervene.","Every director should take an acting class.","At the end of the day the question comes, what are you doing for the world? You have to try to do something that's going to add something positive.","What's great about the geek spirit is that life never seems to stop us, and they never seem to kill our enthusiasm, our optimism and our hunger to experience the world. We keep our sense of humor, we protect our dignity, we talk to our friends about the experience and then we start again fresh the very next day.","The director is the only person on the set who has seen the film. Your job as a director is to show up every day and know where everything will fit into the film.","My style of comedy is very real and bittersweet, and sort of always on the verge of kind of being tragic.","I'm extremely, extremely lucky to be who I am and do what I do and work with the people I work with. Even though I can always find something to complain about, I find it very hard to complain.","I'm kind of a failure. I mean, I'll be honest. I'm successful in that I'm getting to work on great stuff, but I think I'm a failure in all the personal stuff that is most important to me.","A lot of comedies fall apart because they just go from joke to joke, and the characters are all sort of being crazy off on their own.","What I do as a director is really create a safe environment that everyone can feel very comfortable in and experiment within so that they don't hold back anything. You never ever want someone to go, 'Oh I shouldn't have done that.' There isn't anything you shouldn't try. If it's terrible, who cares?","I always feel in improv that nothing is ever as good once it's repeated.","If you're not connected emotionally to a story, then you're dead. You're really just opening the door for people to lose interest and their minds to wander, for them to start picking it apart.","I always hated high-school shows and high-school movies, because they were always about the cool kids. It was always about dating and sex, and all the popular kids, and the good-looking kids. And the nerds were super-nerdy cartoons, with tape on their glasses. I never saw 'my people' portrayed accurately.","The dueling maturity levels in high school is such a source of comedy to me. I was always such a late developer. I was last to walk. I was last to ride a bike. I was last to have sex. That's why it's fun to portray one side of your childhood onscreen.","In my years of acting, the one thing I was never able to do convincingly was to laugh on camera. Fake-laugh.","I've always enjoyed people studying themselves in the mirror, and I also enjoy those 'walk and feel bad' shots. I like anything that isolates people and focuses them on themselves, or makes us focus on their faces as they're going through something.","My wife and I don't have kids and people are down on us about it. But we're just not wired that way, so don't tell me I have to.","Whatever makes you laugh is fine, and all we can do as comedy professionals is try to steer you towards something that we think is a little better - but not put you down or just perplex you in the process.","What you want is the thing that critics love and audiences love, but that's the hardest thing to do.","I have an inability to enjoy things, but that's why we're in comedy. If we were happy, we wouldn't be funny, I guess.","The hard thing is getting people to come to the theater to see something, no matter if it's good or not.","At the end of the day, successful box office just means that more people saw what you did and liked it, and that to me is the most important thing. That a lot of people saw it and liked it.","Women comedy is different than men comedy. Guy comedy is very aggressive, it's about insulting each other, name-calling, and kind of busting each other's chops, and that's not what women's comedy is.","I've never been comfortable around groups of guys when it gets into the putting-down. My past being a kind of geek - it kind of turns into an attack on the weakest of the group.","I love the pictures of Old Hollywood, seeing the directors dressed in suits and ties. Even the grips would be wearing ties. But the biggest thing is when I was a kid, I couldn't wait to be an adult, and I think what happens with most guys is that no one wants to be an adult anymore. So they're dressing like kids.","I'm just always a bit thrown when, in the immediate aftermath of some event which makes us feel like either God's out to get us or He's not doing His job as well as He can, we all still get together and continue to ask Him for help.","I was brought up in a very religious household and did a lot of praying throughout a big part of my life and always thought of God as being not only a powerful father figure and the ruler of all time and dimension but also as a friend with whom I could chat and ask questions to and get advice from.","I'm not looking for people to bow down to me or do things in my name or even pass around a collection plate for me. I say that I'd like to be God for a while because He really can get away with anything. I mean, ANYTHING.","God does things that fly completely in the face of what we've all been taught that He is supposed to do and every time He does this, we all just say, 'Oh, well, I guess there must be some good reason why He did that.'","'Nuclear' is nothing but trouble. Do you say 'new-clear' or do you say 'nuke-you-ler'? Whoever invented that word had obviously never studied the human mouth. We don't have enough muscles in our face to make that group of letters come out smoothly. The word is missing a middle syllable, for cryin' out loud.","'Constitutional' is just a real pip of a word. Positively rolls off the tongue. In fact, it's downright fun to say. 'Con-stit-too-shun-al.' It's the verbal equivalent of skipping down the street with an ice cream cone in your hand. It's like a semantic bag of Lays potato chips. You simply can't just say it once.","I was a standup comedian, which is kind of like writing and directing yourself.","I'm glad I took the leap away from acting into going behind the camera because it's much more satisfying - I love acting and I still do, but it's much more satisfying to be able to make the stuff.","As a director, I really wanted to learn and I needed to get away from my own stuff to figure out how to just do things and work with good people.","I'm a pretty feminized geek, you know? I have that point of view, I grew up around a lot of girls, so I'm pretty sensitive to that. But I don't dare say 'I know how women think.'","What you never want to do is have a story that doesn't track emotionally, because then you're going joke to joke and you're going to fatigue the audience. The only thing that's going to string them to the next joke is how successful the previous joke is.","You can never have a thousand percent batting average on jokes - it's just never going to happen.","Everyone takes pause at 40. It's the age you have to assess everything in your life. It's the fictitious marker that's always coming up when you're young. The world really does look at you to kind of have it together by 40, and be successful by 40. Whatever success means.","It's healthy to have older friends. You go, 'Look, I'm younger than them!' That's always the nice thing, if you can be the youngest one in the room at times. Like if you're always the oldest one in the room, you'll start to feel like the oldest person in the world. So get older friends, because they're cool. Get cool older friends.","When I went to high school, in the late 1970s, disco was in full swing and anyone who was into it dressed the part. I know I did.","I'm from Mt. Clemens, Michigan. It's right outside Detroit. The suburbs. I was always very heavily involved in theater back then. I was always in drama club or forensics. Anything that you could do that had some performing, I was doing it.","I've never had to get a job as a waiter or anything. I've always been able to support myself in 'the biz.' Which is great. It's really fantastic to be able to say that, because I know it's hard to do.","Period costume films are fun to discover, but they're not relatable. It's more, 'Wow, that's cool - did it really look like that back then?' Whereas with a comedy, you're like, 'Yeah, that's me, that's my friends.' No matter what, I want people to relate.","The reason most comedies don't win awards is that the filmmakers put the comedy first. This means you have to create a story around the jokes.","The awards world can be ridiculous, but I'm not one to bash it. I love awards! When I've been nominated for Emmys and when I won my DGA Award, I couldn't have been happier. I always liked getting a gold star in class.","Bad women's comedies are made by men who didn't consult enough women.","Ever since I was a little kid, I've felt comfortable in a suit. It all started when my mom bought me a three-piece Pierre Cardin suit. I wore that thing everywhere. Eventually I realized I was going to be the kid who got beat up in school, but I kept wearing it.","With a suit, even if you're having a nervous breakdown, you still look like you're in charge.","What's so great about working with really funny women is that vanity comes second. Whatever makes it real and funny, they're going to go for, and it's just great.","I couldn't be happier to not be acting. I miss it, but I don't miss the auditioning or trying to get work.","What I don't like is when I see stuff that I know has had a lot of improv done or is playing around where there's no purpose to the scene other than to just be funny. What you don't want is funny scene, funny scene, funny scene, and now here's the epiphany scene and then the movie's over.","We didn't used to be so precious about women in comedy back in the old days.","I can't impress enough upon people that if you tell an honest story that people relate to and people believe and invest in, you can do anything.","The greatest way for people to experience a comedy is to go in not knowing anything about it. But because of marketing, it's impossible. Marketing meaning that in order to get people to come you can't just go, 'Hey, there's a great movie - we're not going to show you anything from it but trust us!'","At the end of the day if you want to entertain people, you've got to take your ego out of the equation.","At the end of the day, I just want a movie that's great, that people are going to love and laugh at and be affected by, and also have an emotional journey.","There's nothing worse than the sequel that's a letdown from the first movie.","Yeah, you know, I like to throw myself on the sword so that others may feel better about themselves. I tell the stories that you all want to forget, but when you remember it, it hopefully makes you laugh.","I've never been to a class reunion or anything because I'm always afraid of that one - there's going to be some 'Carrie'-like incident.","Women's humor seems to be a little more supportive. It's just kind of trying to make the other one laugh through funny voices and kind of talking about other people. I respond to that. I feel less like I'm going to get beat up in a room full of women than I do in a room full of guys.","As tempting as it seems to wear tennis shoes with your tux, don't do it. I think it looks ridiculous. If you're 14 years old, maybe give it a shot. In general, don't portray anything that says 'I'm too cool and I don't care.'","You need to have one element about your outfit that is imperfect, that says you live in it and you're not letting it control you. I think men and women both need a softness about them with formal wear.","Wearing a tuxedo isn't as simple as it sounds. I've been to a lot of award shows in Hollywood over the years and have seen some pretty sad tuxes. It's surprisingly easy to go off the rails.","Man up and add a tux to your wardrobe. Just find one you like and get it well-tailored to your own measurements.","Whatever you wear, you have to own it. Make it yours."],"Paul Fleischman":["I should tell you that many people think that authors just cut and paste from real life into books. It doesn't work quite that way.","I grew up in a house that might have had the only front-yard cornfield in all of Los Angeles.","The few words of a title are the hardest words for any author to come up with.","I'm a very careful, slow writer, and I think a lot of that comes from the care required to be a hand-printer, where if something isn't spaced out enough, you take little slivers of brass or copper and put them between each letter.","Parents should keep 'Eyes Wide Open' next to the 'Kinsey Report' on their shelves.","Science explains what nature is doing; money often explains what we're doing.","People don't like to be nagged. When people nag us, we instantly resist, but when the facts force us in that same direction, we instantly adapt.","I actually went on a vegan diet. So I was nagging myself there. I don't nag other people about it. It was sort of an interesting experiment, and I found it wasn't that hard at all.","What could be more exciting when the writing is going well and things are falling into place? It's just like riding a fabulous wave for a surfer. There's no better place to be.","Warming is incontrovertible, so in general, you're going to have more droughts, more fires. So I think events like that are the best thing that could happen for righting our ship and getting us on a safer course."],"Paul Fussell":["I find nothing more depressing than optimism.","The more violent the body contact of the sports you watch, the lower the class.","Americans are the only people in the world known to me whose status anxiety prompts them to advertise their college and university affiliations in the rear window of their automobiles.","The worst thing about war was the sitting around and wondering what you were doing morally."],"Paul Gallagher":["I'm in the facial-hair phase of my career.","I thought you were supposed to be flying this thing, not pleasuring it."],"Paul Gallico":["Kittens can happen to anyone.","No game in the world is as tidy and dramatically neat as baseball, with cause and effect, crime and punishment, motive and result, so cleanly defined.","If there is any larceny in a man, golf will bring it out.","Nobody's a natural.

Then I would try and train and it was no good, then have another drink just to pass the day away.","If I want to be a better person for whoever is in my life, I have to learn.","I'll tell you the truth: I had a double brandy before the game but, before, it used to be four bottles of whisky. Not any more. I was fine. I had a glass of wine after the game. But it was just a mouthful.","I've learnt and I just want to be respected for what I've achieved on the pitch. I know I haven't achieved much off it but I do know I've given pleasure to people watching me play football over the years.","I am going to continue and bring this club forward. I am Paul Gascoigne the footballer.","The drink? Yes, I've had tough times in my life, especially the last year, regarding my ex-wife, my kids, I nearly broke my neck, I was on death row with pneumonia.","You learn, right, a lot of people's problems - why they get upset, why they get down, why they turn to drink - is because they can't say one word and it's N-O, no.","I never predict anything, and I never will.","Anyway, how can you sack anyone who still hasn't got a contract. I'll be there for the game and I'll stand behind the dugout giving instructions to the players from there. They will respond to me more than the next manager.","At the end of it, I'll maybe do a coaching badge but I'm not going to get forced into things.","But then I always wanted to play for Rangers. Man United is a great club and Alex Ferguson is a legend.","Hopefully everybody will just let me get on with my life. I'm going to.","I do want to be a manager one day. It might be 10 years, I don't know when.","I don't really do pranks any more. I have a laugh in the dressing room here, where it's safe, and the guys don't go to the papers and tell them what I've done.","I fought back, got injured again and I had to have another operation. I got down and depressed and I think I was drinking more than I should. Well, I know I was.","I had to accept that I was an alcoholic, that was the main thing. I think you've got to. But I try not say that I'm an alcoholic. I prefer to say that it's a disease I've got.","I know as a manager you have to abide by the chairman's decisions. But his decisions were this team, that team, this player, that player. The chairman is a control freak.","I like to help create team spirit in the dressing room. I feel that I've got loads of love to give.","I never refused an autograph, never refused to buy someone a drink. Now I'm learning to say I've got other things on, instead of doing it and wondering why.","I take responsibility for myself and what I do now.","I thought I did well for someone who has been out for 10 or 11 months. Then I was sub against Liverpool and tried to play for the guys and work on my fitness.","I won player of the year and players' player, two cups and two championship medals, had a great time.","I'm going to do things when they are right for me.","I've got a bit of money in the bank. I'm quite comfortable.","I've had to deal with everything but everyone has helped me, including Sir Alex Ferguson, to get through. George Best was a good friend of mine. We loved each other, we both knew where we were coming from.","If the fans want me out, I'll put my hands up and leave. Like a proper man. I won't make excuses, I'll leave.","Then all the foreigners started coming over. I don't mind that but a lot of teams are laying out fortunes for ordinary players and that's no good for our youngsters coming through.","Well, I did know - but I just wanted the day to pass and the next day to come and then I wanted that one to pass. It was a horrible cycle. I felt so close to having to pack the game in."],"Paul Gauguin":["Art is either plagiarism or revolution.","Life has no meaning unless one lives it with a will, at least to the limit of one's will. Virtue, good, evil are nothing but words, unless one takes them apart in order to build something with them; they do not win their true meaning until one knows how to apply them.","Stressing output is the key to improving productivity, while looking to increase activity can result in just the opposite.","I shut my eyes in order to see.","We never really know what stupidity is until we have experimented on ourselves.","Civilization is what makes you sick.","The history of modern art is also the history of the progressive loss of art's audience. Art has increasingly become the concern of the artist and the bafflement of the public.","Many excellent cooks are spoilt by going into the arts.","Art requires philosophy, just as philosophy requires art. Otherwise, what would become of beauty?","There is always a heavy demand for fresh mediocrity. In every generation the least cultivated taste has the largest appetite.","It is the eye of ignorance that assigns a fixed and unchangeable color to every object; beware of this stumbling block.","Life is hardly more than a fraction of a second. Such a little time to prepare oneself for eternity!","In art, all who have done something other than their predecessors have merited the epithet of revolutionary; and it is they alone who are masters.","Concentrate your strengths against your competitor's relative weaknesses.","Life being what it is, one dreams of revenge."],"Paul Giamatti":["I was the youngest child and got a lot more freedom than my brother and sister. I used to wander, doing my own thing under the radar, but I didn't get in bad, bad trouble.","I learned how to fire a sniper rifle, which I'm sure will be useful at some point.","I consider myself an atheist. My wife is Jewish. And I'm fine with my son being raised as a Jew. He's learning Hebrew and is really into it. I will talk to my own son about my atheism when the time is right. But there's a great tradition of Jewish atheism, there are no better atheists in the world than the Jews.","In a weird way, I like to find the quirkiness in ordinary things. I like to find what is ordinary in quirky people.","Lead roles are fun, but I'm especially happy other, more colorful supporting stuff has come along.","I like playing weird, kind of shady people.","You are absolutely free to describe me as a turtle or something.","Now, actors get so familiarized with Eastern Europe. I never imagined I'd get as familiar with Budapest and Prague and places like that in my life.","I don't consider myself a very interesting person. I have the mentality of a supporting actor.","Academia is a rarified culture, especially an Ivy League academic background.","I definitely had a top-notch education.","With 'Duplicity', I was a little bit like, 'This isn't that hard of a movie.' This isn't like some huge brain trust of a movie. You gotta be a little bit awake to follow the plot, but it's really just a kind of light entertainment. It's like those Cary Grant movies, which are not meant to be anything other than diverting. In a nice way.","I'm pretty easy to get along with on set, but I'm probably hard on myself.","Am I really cool? You're telling me I'm cool? Well, that's good to hear.","Well, you know, when people say stuff about you, it's always really flattering. But does it mean anything to me? It's not really real to me; there's no reality to it.","It'd be disingenuous to say I don't like attention - I'm an actor for God's sake - and it's flattering and all, but attention was never my big goal. I just like to work and have a good time.","This whole business feels kind of intense, like a bad fit. Round peg, square hole. But whatever, I'll take it.","I've got to be the geekiest guy in the world in a lot of ways. I'm like a zeta male.","Acting can be a really silly thing. It's like playing dress-up.","I definitely have a tendency to only see the blemishes of things, and see lots of things about my acting that I don't like.","I've very critical of myself, and film has been an adjustment for me.","I don't mind being stereotyped in some way and playing certain kinds of guys, but if I can find something to occasionally get a break from that, that would be nice. And I feel like I manage to.","I always would be happy to make a character even more unlikable, but you know, there's a limit and if you go there, you get into a very different kind of movie, man.","I find that the crazy narcissists, the selfish loons are often the most fun to be around, weirdly.","Sometimes, I think I may be more recognizable because I'm character-looking.","I'm not a big wine guy. And bars, I never go to bars anymore. It's such a drag, man.","I get tired of myself pretty fast.","I like to work - I probably work too much.","I don't mind talking about acting. I don't have anything interesting to say about it, but it's interesting talking about it.","I never thought I would have any particular career in movies at all.","Somehow whatever I play ends up being sleazy.","I mean, I'm not going to play the hero of something.","It is because my dad died suddenly that I became an actor. I thought, I'm going to make money doing this thing I enjoy.","As an actor, to have achieved financial stability is amazing. But I always have this weird fear that I'm not going to get any more work; it's about not having enough money.","I'm clearly not Brad Pitt, and I'm never going to be Brad Pitt.","The supporting thing can be harder to pop in and out of. The hardest thing is the people who have to come in and play, say, the bartender for a day - that's a lot harder than playing the lead role. You have to pop in and get it right. It's a lot of pressure to just pop in there and fit in and find your footing really fast.","I suppose there must be some way in which I'm compelled to show some side of myself - or of people - that's paranoid and fraught and beleaguered and downtrodden, just as Tom Cruise wants to show that he's terrifyingly upbeat and terrifyingly heroic all the time.","I have the mentality of a supporting actor.","I still want to be the guy who can get on the subway and check out the freak on the subway.","I don't think film actors need training, really.","I wanted to play Zapruder, as he is a man you really don't know much about: a faceless, anonymous figure.","There is something pleasurable for an actor to produce something and not be in it.","If I play a more aggressive, stronger guy, I often go through my day feeling a bit better than when I play somebody who's not.","I was more used to acting onstage, for a long time. I don't know, maybe I was temperamentally more suited to stage stuff. And there are things about the stage that I miss in a lot of ways.","'Capricorn One' just seemed like... wow. That was it, y'know? Nothing was ever going to be better than that movie.","Most conspiracies interest me because of the people who are into them, and the lengths they'll go to expose it or the evidence they think they have. All that stuff. There's just something so beautiful to me about people who sincerely believe we never went to the moon. It gives me so much joy.","I remember when I was at the first showing of 'John Dies at the End' at Sundance, and I was talking to some of the people in the standby crowd who were outside and didn't have tickets. They were just waiting in line to see if they could get in. It was this whole gang of die-hard sci-fi wacko people, and they were just fantastic.","I don't really have any opinion about my performance in 'Big Momma's House.'","I was a big 'Planet of The Apes' fan, so I was really excited about being in it. I had a really good time. I liked wearing all that stuff, and I liked playing the part.","I don't feel like I've ever done anything - even 'Big Momma's House' - that I didn't really have some desire to do.","I would probably choose supporting roles if I had to make a choice. It's actually a really hard thing to say. It's all on a role-by-role basis, ultimately. I shouldn't be so quick to say that. I feel like you're given greater license to be colorful and eccentric in supporting roles, and that's interesting to me.","It's funny: most people who recognize me on the subway and stuff - it's much more they think of me as a funny guy. I get much more of people telling me how much I make them laugh, actually. Which is nice.","I played old men back in drama school. It's just now that I'm drawing level with the age of the characters I play, but I'm fine with that, and I've certainly never envied people who became hugely famous when they were young.","I was never the class clown or put on shows at home. I never thought of acting as something I could do with my life. When I was a kid, I used to run around wrapped in toilet paper so I could be the Mummy. But that wasn't a sign that I was dreaming of being an actor. I was just an odd child.","The white male is one of the easiest things to be. There's always a job; there's always something for you to do.","I don't think film actors need training, really, but I needed any help I could get.","I've never not been proud of the work I was doing; I have nothing I have any shame about.","Do you know Don Coscarelli? 'Bubba Ho-Tep?' That's one of my favorite movies in the world. And I love the 'Phantasm' movies.","I did a movie called 'American Splendor', based on the comic book writer Harvey Pekar.","One of my favourite things growing up was 'Asterix', those books.","Am I an anxious guy? I think I have been called upon as an actor a lot to access emotions like that. But I don't really think I am a big worrier. I don't see myself like that. But I guess other people do. Which is maybe worrying in itself.","The problem with getting injured when you get older is that it takes longer to recover.","The 'Planet of the Apes' movies made me wanna - probably unconsciously - be an actor. Seriously. And The Mummy - and 'Hammer horror' movies. 'Fantastic.' I loved stuff like that, and that stuff probably did more than anything to make me wanna do it.","When I did 'Lady in the Water,' the most exciting thing to me was to get to work with Bob Balaban - I couldn't leave the guy alone. I drove him crazy. He's fantastic and a hilarious guy.","I worked with J. T. Walsh - it was one of the best experiences I ever had - a fantastic actor and a great guy. I was in the last movie that he did: 'The Negotiator.' He died a couple of months after that. He was great.","I was an English major at Yale, but I did do undergraduate theater there. And I went to the graduate school for acting.","I really do like a really good science fiction movie and a really good horror movie. Those are the kinds of things I really like. But, I mean, I'm not into sort of like slasher movies. I like a really good science fiction movie, which is hard to do. They don't make many really good ones any more.","I really only started doing film in '97. I mean, before then, I just pretty much did theater.","My father died in 1989 before I knew what I was going to do with my life. I had just graduated from college. My mother died just before 'Sideways' came out. She knew I was an actor, but she never saw me become successful.","Religion features more now in my life than it did when I was a kid - my dad rejected the Catholic church as a young man. I had no religious upbringing, but certainly, Dad was a kind of secular humanist. I don't know if he was an atheist or agnostic. I regret I didn't talk to him about it.","Growing up, I didn't know where I was headed, except to the grave or maybe to the gutter. I went through wanting to do a lot of things, but acting wasn't one of them.","I think one of the great things about acting is the instant gratification: you just get up and start being a part of the story. The immediacy is something you get really addicted to.","'Rosemary's Baby' is a real New York movie, even though you wouldn't necessarily think of it as one, though I do.","I want to be a villain with steel hands or something. I want to be the crazy, world-domination-obsessed villain. I would love to be a Bond villain.","I try to avoid people as much as possible. They might change my life!","Honestly, I never wanted to be more than a good supporting actor. Really, I enjoy it."],"Paul Gillmor":["America's health care system provides some of the finest doctors and more access to vital medications than any country in the world. And yet, our system has been faltering for many years with the increased cost of health care.","As the cost of gasoline rises and our dependence on foreign oil continues to increase, the effect of sending over $100 billion each year to OPEC nations hurts every American.","While not widely reported, our victories in Iraq are plentiful. National elections, a democratic parliament and the drafting of a constitution are just some of the victories throughout this embattled country.","The American economy has always been driven by the entrepreneurial nature of its citizens, and blocking access to affordable health care will only suffocate growth within the small business sector of our economy.","We must have a relentless commitment to producing a meaningful, comprehensive energy package aimed at conservation, alleviating the burden of energy prices on consumers, decreasing our country's dependency on foreign oil, and increasing electricity grid reliability.","In this life and death case, I felt Mrs. Schiavo should receive the fullest due process from our legal system.","I represent the views and the values of the people of the district.","It does seem fair to give them the option of a better return.","We haven't had a good energy policy in this country for decades and we're trying to get one.","The current system punishes communities which make the investment in creating landfills, only to have them filled by states which refuse to adequately address their waste issues.","We are putting more and more power into a system which is less and less able to carry it reliably.","More than seven months ago, our country learned that the horrors portrayed in Hollywood's make-believe world could actually come to life before our very eyes.","Americans in all places and levels of government have begun to consider the areas where we need to prepare ourselves from future threats, including the latest weapon: bio-terror.","I believe it is incumbent upon Congress to act aggressively to ameliorate fear and help our country take the essential steps that will make our communities and lives safer.","We should not forget, no matter how we quantify it: 'Freedom is not free.' It is a painful lesson, but one from which we have learned in the past and one we should never forget.","Enrolling in the Medicare Prescription Drug Program will be a great savings for most senior citizens.","It has been a top priority of Congress to reduce the drug costs of all seniors.","Following the devastation of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, $3 per gallon gasoline became common and our nation has come under considerable strain.","In the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, our nation has been put under considerable fiscal pressure.","The fact is, almost every year since the founding of these United States, our government has lived beyond its means.","To date, every American citizen has nearly $27,000 in public debt riding on our backs.","Spending on programs such as national defense and funding the operating budgets of all federal agencies represent only 39 percent of our yearly budget, an all-time low.","In order to effectively protect our loved ones, we must provide the American public with unfettered access to know who these dangerous criminals are and where they are living.","The Declaration is a magnificent document.","The Declaration of Independence is a sacred part of American history.","The beliefs expressed in the Declaration of Independence remain a standard for our nation today. They also remain a standard for those nations across the globe striving to achieve democracy.","Insurgents throughout Iraq continue to threaten our efforts and pose a danger to stability in the region. They fight not for their country, but rather against ours.","The lack of health care coverage has remained very important to me during my time in Congress and as a member of the House Subcommittee on Health, I am working hard with my colleagues to correct these inequalities.","While there are many influences on gas prices in America, I believe the passage of a national energy bill will help relieve this burden on our country.","Among the many important provisions in the energy bill are the creation of an estimated half million new jobs, increased oil production, blackout protection, controlling fertilizer costs by stabilizing natural gas prices and enacting new efficiency benchmarks.","In addition, each barrel of oil we save through conservation further decreases our dangerous reliance on unstable Middle East oil."],"Paul Gleason":["My biggest weakness is patience, wanting to see things happen too quickly or get changes in place right away. Not having the patience to let things develop.","That ability to take in your surroundings and sort out the important stuff, to be aware, to be vigilant.

And even though it's full of cars, its shape and form didn't get created around the automobile."],"Paul Goodman":["Enjoyment is not a goal, it is a feeling that accompanies important ongoing activity.","Few great men would have got past personnel.","There is such a thing as food and such a thing as poison. But the damage done by those who pass off poison as food is far less than that done by those who generation after generation convince people that food is poison.","It rarely adds anything to say, 'In my opinion' - not even modesty. Naturally a sentence is only your opinion; and you are not the Pope.","In America you can say anything you want - as long as it doesn't have any effect.","It takes application, a fine sense of value, and a powerful community-spirit for a people to have serious leisure, and this has not been the genius of the Americans."],"Paul Gosar":["I am honored to have heard from so many voters, supporters, and local elected officials who have been pleased with the work I have done on their behalf.

Whiskey's for drinking; water's for fightin' over.","When it comes to wildfires, 2013 wasn't a good year, which is why I'm especially proud that the majority of my wildfire prevention legislation was signed into law today.","I've asked the Department of the Interior inspector general to look into how much manpower and taxpayer money has been spent responding to ALEC-supported bills that force federal land managers to give land to states.","It is my hope that Pope Francis realizes his time is better spent focusing on matters like religious tolerance and the sanctity of all life.","The president and his open border allies may hate the fact that the Constitution gets in the way of their political agenda, but it's up to Congress to take bold action and stop this lawlessness.","One of the responsibilities of Congress is the power of the purse, but there is also oversight. In order to have proper oversight, you have to have agency administrators, directors, and secretaries of those agencies speak frankly and about the facts.","I wish my brother well. We agree to disagree, but he is a good man. He is my brother.","The integrity of our government, our Republic, fundamentally relies on the principle that no person, not even the president or the nation's chief law enforcement officer, is above our laws.","You're not going to find me cringe from my record.","The consequences of Fast and Furious are higher crime and more deaths.

But to promote questionable science as Catholic dogma is ridiculous.","If the Pope plans to spend the majority of his time advocating for flawed climate change policies, then I will not attend.","It is difficult to convey the excitement I first felt when it was revealed that His Holiness Pope Francis was invited to Washington D.C. to address the world from the floor of the House of Representatives.","The earth's climate has been changing since God created it, with or without man. On that, we should all agree.","If the Pope spoke out with moral authority against violent Islam, I would be there cheering him on.","If the Pope urged the Western nations to rescue persecuted Christians in the Middle East, I would back him wholeheartedly.","I don't need to be lectured by the Pope about climate change.","I am endorsing Sen. Cruz because I have worked with him in the trenches, fought battles with him on the Hill, and he has proven himself to be honorable, tough, and a man of his word.

And once all the chips have been played, you make sure you're working on behalf of Arizona.","American citizens and communities should be free to choose where they would like to live and not be subject to federal neighborhood engineering at the behest of an overreaching federal government.","Administrator McCarthy committed perjury and made several false statements at multiple congressional hearings and as a result, is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors - an impeachable offense.","Article I, Section 8, Clause 4 of the Constitution grants Congress clear jurisdiction with regard to U.S. citizenship and immigration matters.","Congress has consistently rejected policies that aim to allow illegal aliens to serve in the military.","NDAA should be about providing critical funding for our troops, not debating immigration policy.","I think pressure gets to people when it appears they're trying to cover things up.","It appears that the Obama Administration is attempting to silence public comments and once again pander to extremist mining opponents seeking to undermine a bipartisan jobs bill that is estimated to create approximately 3,700 new jobs and generate $60 billion dollars for our economy.","When more land is locked up by the federal government, real people suffer, and opportunities for future prosperity are reduced.","It is time to go on the offense. Hold people accountable for the wrongdoings they do and commit against the American people, use the vestiges of the Constitution which gives us the outline of how we hold them accountable and make the Justice Department do their job.","The magic of the American experience is that we've upheld the rule of law for everybody, everybody treated equally beneath the law.","If you're not going to have consequences to a bad decision or to mislead Congress or any other aspect of life, that only incubates people to hatch bigger ideas that are not forthright and not abiding by the law.","Perjury before Congress is perjury to the American people and an affront to the fundamental principles of our republic and the rule of law. Such behavior cannot be tolerated.","That part of life is the thing that we really need to concentrate on. If you lose the way children look through their eyes at the world, it really becomes kind of a doldrum.","There are things that should be allocated to states' rights - that's Gryffindor - and certain things allocated to the federal government, which is Slytherin.","Being from Arizona, the federal government is kind of a Slytherin.","One of the things that Dumbledore is always trying to do is to empower the kids to take ownership of issues and be creative and involved. That's what we see today. We need to empower America to be a creator of its solutions going forward in a new, very confusing world.","Revoking Bill Cosby's Medal of Freedom won't undo his actions or heal the wounds of his victims, but it will signal to the American people that we will not tolerate such lewd behavior.","I'm very proud of Arizona as being a leader.

And I applaud Arizona in regards to this.","Nobody's lesser or greater; that's what our Constitution is about.","All men are created equal.","The thing about it is, I'm one of these people that if you're not getting anywhere, you gotta change it up, and you gotta ask more questions.","I'm results-oriented.","Like so many Americans, I am sick and tired of watching the rapid decline of our culture right in front of our eyes.","It is time to reclaim our nation's moral compass.","We impugn the private sector, we impugn main street America, and the bureaucracy cannot be held to any different standard whatsoever.","Leadership has a price.","The only way that we can disincentivize Central American immigrants from illegally entering our country is if we change our policies, tweak our laws, cut the bureaucratic red tape and immediately send them back to their countries of origin. Until then, this self-imposed crisis will continue to worsen.","A government that can take all and can seize all, a government that doesn't trust its citizens, a government that says it's their way or the highway... that's the scary part.","If the United States has normalized relations with Cuba, why would we treat illegal immigrants from that nation any different than those from other countries? It is time we level the playing field and end the outdated, preferential treatment for Cubans.","Our leadership in D.C. should be bold and determined.","We do not need more status quo.","We do not need mindless spending bills with no reforms attached.","We do not need $1 allowed for the president to enact amnesty.","Water's about everything. And when the federal government controls water, it controls everything - that's the problem.","I refuse to go along with the status quo of more wasteful federal spending, and I refuse to let the Obama Administration continue to force their misguided ideology through regulatory overreach.","Our country needs more bold, conservative leaders that will actually do what they promised to do prior to coming to Washington D.C.","While Secretary Napolitano may be gone, she will not be forgotten. Her inaction and incompetence on border security will continue to plague our nation for years to come.","I have been relentless in my pursuit to hold Eric Holder accountable for his actions and will not rest until the door officially hits him on his way out.","The people around the nation, but specifically in Arizona where operation Fast and Furious was carried out, deserve more from their president and their attorney general. I will not rest until full answers are given about this project, justice is served for those responsible, and Attorney General Holder takes responsibility for his role.","108 members of congress have signed onto my Resolution of No Confidence in Attorney General Holder as a first step towards recognizing that he must be held accountable for the actions of his department and for his personal unwillingness to cooperate with congressional oversight requests.","You don't have to agree with my vote, but you need to at least understand how I came to my vote.","Shockingly, the Government Accountability Institute has reported that the 2008 and 2012 Obama campaigns received questionable contributions of more than $500 million as a result of poor disclosure requirements.","When you have over 500 million dollars in questionable contributions, shouldn't that start to alert people?","I know Gov. Palin is a classy lady and has her head on straight.","When it comes to politics, it's nice to be mired with Sarah Palin. But I'm Paul Gosar. I'm my own person.","We were sent here to hold government accountable.","It's really hard to judge people until you see what they do with the job.","We have farmers in southwestern Yuma, so immigration - they wanted to talk to us about it.","We need immigration reform, but we need open-air, smaller bills that are germane to an issue and have an open discussion with the American people.","We shouldn't have to pass a bill to find out what's in it.","I have nothing to hide.","Our border security is laughable.","America's angry. America's scared. They want security from their country.","We have to learn to do more with less.","I will continue to ask the president and his subordinates to work with Congress rather than against it.","It's absolutely shameful that Rep. Grijalva would try to use tribes as political pawns to implement the misguided agenda of extremist environmental groups."],"Paul Graham":["Dressing up is inevitably a substitute for good ideas. It is no coincidence that technically inept business types are known as 'suits'.","We don't have to go that far to sell our beer because our immediate accounts sell so much. Places that sold 10 cases before, now they're selling 30.","I get a lot of criticism for telling founders to focus first on making something great, instead of worrying about how to make money. And yet that is exactly what Google did. And Apple, for that matter. You'd think examples like that would be enough to convince people.","Everyone by now presumably knows about the danger of premature optimization. I think we should be just as worried about premature design - designing too early what a program should do.","There are plenty of smart people who get nowhere.","It's hard to say exactly what it is about face-to-face contact that makes deals happen, but whatever it is, it hasn't yet been duplicated by technology.","If you imagine someone with 100 percent determination and 100 percent intelligence, you can discard a lot of intelligence before they stop succeeding. But if you start discarding determination, you very quickly get an ineffectual and perpetual grad student.","What I tell founders is not to sweat the business model too much at first. The most important task at first is to build something people want. If you don't do that, it won't matter how clever your business model is.","I suppose I should learn Lisp, but it seems so foreign.","A programming language is for thinking about programs, not for expressing programs you've already thought of. It should be a pencil, not a pen.","For the most ambitious young people, the corporate ladder is obsolete.","Small-business customers are very conservative and very cheap. We don't have to explain ourselves for the most part.","In the startup world, 'not working' is normal.","If you really understand something, you can say it in the fewest words, instead of thrashing about.","When Facebook first started, and it was just a social directory for undergrads at Harvard, it would have seemed like such a bad startup idea, like some student side project.","Some people just get what they want in the world.","Startups often have to do dubious things.","Empirically the way you get a product visionary as CEO is for him to found the company and not get fired.","One startup I dream of funding is the one that kills the record companies.","You know your business model is broken when you're suing your customers.","Like having a child, running a startup is the sort of experience that's hard to imagine unless you've done it yourself.","If you could replace high-school yearbooks, that could be a lot of money. It's so clearly waiting for someone to come along."],"Paul Greengard":["In terms of the brain, you can in a crude way think of the human brain as a computer.","Modesty isn't one of my strong suits.","I'm sure our brains are working unconsciously. When you have a creative thought, it's parts of the brain talking to each other without your awareness.","I have a lot of confidence through my accomplishments. I'm always trying to prove I'm not the worthless child they say I was.","The knowledge we have of communication among cells does not permit my giving you a sophisticated understanding.","I didn't want to spend my life contributing to the development of more atomic weaponry.","It's a tragedy for society to spend decades training people and then depriving them of work at some arbitrary age.","My philosophy is that we should ask the most important question that's capable of being solved.","The fact is all of the most highly successful scientists I know work practically all the time.","You should only go into science if you really have a yearning to make scientific discoveries.","Science is not the glamour that's portrayed in films. It's a lot of drudgery work, along with the wonderfully exciting periods when you discover something.","We do not know with any of these neuropsychiatric disorders what the ultimate basis is. Let's say you could find that too much of protein X was involved in schizophrenia. Would you then know what schizophrenia is? You would not."],"Paul Greengrass":["Remembering is painful, it's difficult, but it can be inspiring and it can give wisdom.","When you think of the Cold War, there are various places where you imagine espionage. Espionage crossroads of the Cold War bring you to the backstreets of Berlin, or Vienna.","Speaking personally as a filmmaker, I think encoded in Bond are a series of values about Britain, about the world, about masculinity, about power, about the empire that I don't share. Quite the reverse. Whereas in Bourne, I think encoded is much more scepticism. There's an us and a them, and Bourne is an us, whereas Bond is working for them.","It's a circus life, the movies. It's a lot of travelling, a lot of antisocial hours; there's a lot of it that's about escaping from life.","In the end, it's acting, it's not real. But every director will tell you that you have to create conditions that create tension, because tension is what makes drama feel real.","The people who went on that airplane were unexceptional.","Why are people saying it's too soon? Like the people on that flight, we need to agree about what to do about terrorism. And I think we need to have that conversation now.","To make a film is eighteen months of your life. It's seven days a week. It's twenty hours a day.","Tom Hanks has built his career playing ordinary men.","Making a film, every film, is a big gamble, large or small. The more that you do it, the more you're aware of that.","With a franchise movie, it's got to turn the wheels of the industry, and the studio has to have them. So you start with a release date. They say we're going to make a new 'Bourne' film, and it comes out summer of X. Then they start on a script, and invariably, the script is not ready in time.","In my little imperfect way, what I'm trying to do is understand the world. As a filmmaker, you realize as you get older that each film is part of a dialogue you're having with yourself. That started when I was working in documentaries. And in a way, I've never deviated from it.","Making movies is both entirely ludicrous and incredibly hard. It's a preposterous way to spend your time. You give up a lot for the privilege of doing it, and one of the things you get are relationships of immense trust that you see forged in situations of immense stress.","Directing is all tied up with childhood loneliness. It's such an odd thing to end up doing.","I'd always suspected my face wouldn't fit in drama departments. And it never did!","I just don't get on with institutions. I need simple relationships with people who believe in me.","Studio people are bright. Empowering. They don't want to have to interfere creatively. That's their horror story, too.","I always tell young film-makers, 'Find the song that only you can sing.' It doesn't just come to you. It's trial and error and disappointment before you find, slowly but surely, the confidence to express your film-making identity.","Action is only really compelling when it reveals character - character revealed through action, and not action for its own sake.","Acting is many things, and one is an exercise of will. In any given scene, you're trying to find where the drama and conflict is and then deploy the actors to play at that point of conflict with precision, control, and complete will.","It's no good in a scene to have one actor lie down because the scene says it's the other actor's moment. Each actor has to believe that with extra will, the outcome of a scene can be different. An actor can win the scene if he exerts the most powerful will in that moment.","The most important thing as a filmmaker, the hardest journey you'll have, is to find your point of view.","My films express me, my sense of rhythm, my sense of impact, my sense of kinetic energy. I like films to move, but I like also clear storytelling and characters, and most of all, I like authentic emotion.","All directors make films in individual ways. But the classical kind of view of filmmaking is that you have a script, and it's very linear. There's a script, then you're going to shoot the script ,and then you cut that, and then that's the end of the film. And that's never really been how I've seen it.","Very few people do bad things because they're bad. They generally do bad things because they think they're the right thing to do, but they're misplaced.","What attracts me to Bourne's world is that is a real world, and I think I'm most comfortable there. But I come to a Bourne movie to have fun as a filmmaker, to strut my stuff, and that's part of the fun of franchise filmmaking.","One of the things that makes the Bourne movies so exciting, I think, is you do get to go on a journey. Generally, through the franchise, that journey is in Europe.","I think there's something about a character facing the huge problems and challenges of the contemporary world and meeting them with - head on with courage, allowing for darkness and mistake, but ultimately always moral. That's incredibly, incredibly inspiring, and that's honestly what I think.","No one person is the author of a Bourne film. The truth is it's a coalition of people who share the same vision for Bourne and his world, and we... its remarkably collaborative and collective.","It's funny: when you make a film, you always look back, and there are always crucial decisions that get made. You look back, and at the time they don't seem like it, but you look back, and you see they were absolutely fundamental.","I'll always see myself as a British filmmaker, powerfully so.","I don't storyboard like some. I mean, all directors are different. I plan meticulously - really meticulously.","The best crime stories are always about the crime and its consequences - you know, 'Crime And Punishment' is the classic. Where you have the crime, and its consequences are the story, but considering the crime and the consequences makes you think about the society in which the crime takes place, if you see what I mean.","This new global economy, it's all based on the sea routes.","I am interested in seeing if you can create on film pieces that feel contemporary and urgent.","Ultimately, if you look at all my films from 'Bloody Sunday' on, they're steeped in a post-9/11 atmosphere. 'United 93' is directly about 9/11, of course, but every one of the movies deals with paranoia, mistrust, and fear.","I'm British; I live here, and I've always made my films here. And we're on a journey in British filmmaking right now. We're attracting big films again. 'Star Wars' filming here will employ thousands of people. We're world-class in so many of the craft elements, and the vibrancy of our filmmaking is strong.","Some filmmakers are more eclectic than others. I'm not one of those! I'm interested in what I'm interested in, which is films about the world, about what's going on. I started in TV documentaries with 'World in Action,' and those interests feed into the films I make now.","I've seen a lot of political violence in my life. I know what it looks like. I know what it smells like. I know what motivates young men to do it. I've talked to them about it. I know what victims feel like, you know? I know the abominable effect it has on politics. I know how intractable it is.","Deep down, all directors feel like frauds - because it's built into the nature of the job. You're the jack of all trades and the master of none. The cameraman knows the camera, the sound man knows the sound equipment - and you? You can't do anything: You can't do the acting, you can't dress the set, you don't record the sound or shoot the images.","I spent my 20s making film after film, often in very adverse conditions. You'd fly back from somewhere - Beirut, the Falklands, South Africa - on Saturday, and you'd have 24 hours to cut your film, and it would go out on Monday night.","With the dramatic canvas, I found you could still operate with the documentarist's observational eye.","I prize something that feels authentic. It's an undefinable thing, but I know it when I see it, and I think audiences do, too. One of the reasons why 'Bloody Sunday' and 'United 93' work is because they felt real, felt truthful.","Acting is many things. Acting is playing lines, of course, but it's much more profound than that. Acting is truth-telling and trying to find the truth in a human situation, which will be sketched out by a screenwriter with all the skill that a screenwriter can do; but in the end, that's just the map of the journey.","Finding where to put the camera is probably the most important thing you have to learn when you're a young director, and it's something that's a mixture of instinct and technique.","Whatever your style or subject matter, in the end, film-making is about searching for authenticity - that is what the audience will divine.","The one mistake you must never make is to agree to make a film or sign on to film that you don't believe in. Most importantly because it's unfair on that. It's not about you; it's just not fair on that project because you're doing it a profound disservice because you're not serving it - you're uncommitted, ultimately.","I don't want to feel what I'm creating on film has an outcome that is preordained. I don't think of the world as a place with a divinity that shapes our end. What you try to do with film is create, as far as you possibly can, an unfolding present - a theatre in which an outcome happens and is tested."],"Paul Guilfoyle":["The real rub is finding that authentic self and it's not something that's going to come to you overnight.","It's exciting to think that something I'm involved in is touching so many people in so many cultures.","American shows don't always translate, but this one has and speaking for myself I'm quite glad for it.","You know, dramas are much more expensive to do than say a comedy, so any kind of deficit like that is picked up on when it comes time for them to pick up new shows.","I don't know what an audience wants to see but I know what I like to see.","Well I think that the mind of a serial killer and the mind of the detectives represent the duality we face as people.","Some of the best movies made about crime are those where the crime solver can get inside the head of the serial killer, and those are the techniques we use in C.S.I.","The worst acting is about imitation.","Strive to be authentic all the time. That's sort of my philosophy on life, which applies to acting.","It isn't always hard work that does the job.","Acting is constant exploration.","I look forward to the end of all this money-making part of the career, to be truthful.","I sometimes improvise, and that's what I call 'massaging the character.'","I've always thought really good artists in general are overqualified. You're paid to stand there and do a line, but the guy has probably gone to drama school... but they have developed it to be just, like, one specific line.","I think everyone, all of us, are complicated people. We have jobs that require us to be a certain way. We all do. Unfortunately, our jobs overtake our personality, but that is the world. We live in a conundrum. You have to keep it together.","The thing that attracted me to 'CSI' is that these guys are always professional, but underneath, it's teeming with a heavy shadow. Maybe even some decadence and some weirdness with certain characters! And that always intrigued me as an actor."],"Paul Haggis":["For me, the most interesting people are ones who often work against their best interests. Bad choices. They go in directions where you go, 'No no no nooo!' You push away someone who is trying to love you, you hurt someone who's trying to get your trust, or you love someone you shouldn't.","I am really drawn to damaged characters, and I have a lot of sympathy for them. Making those complicated characters empathetic is something to strive for. It's too easy to create a good guy or a good girl.","'Crash' came from personal experience. I saw things inside me from living in L.A. that made me uncomfortable. I saw horrible things in people and saw terrible things in myself. I saw a black director completely humiliated, but the three people around me just thought it was funny. 'No,' I said, 'that is selling your soul.'","We're trying to reinvent Bond. He's 28 - no Q, no gadgets.","Film is an emotional medium; it's not a logical medium. It's not an intellectual medium, so every decision you make as a filmmaker and an actor has to be emotional in some way, even in the rejection of logic.","I like to write about things about which I have no answers, questions that trouble me. These things trouble me.","I wrote an episode for 'thirtysomething,' and a producer said, 'That's really good, but what is it about? What does it say about you? What questions are you asking yourself?' I had never thought about that. This comment changed who I was, because it made me look at my own soul, the dark corners in my soul, and accept that dark side.","You have to have empathy, knowledge and compassion for your characters if you're a writer.","The wonderful thing about Clint is you can never second guess how he is going to react to anything.","I just asked myself, what piece of that man's soul did he just chew off and swallow to get next week's assignment? You know, just to live, just to work as an artist, or to feed the family?","I don't think it's the job of filmmakers to give anybody answers. I do think, though, that a good film makes you ask questions of yourself as you leave the theatre.","Unless I'm really uneasy with what I'm writing, I lose interest very quickly.","I miss my mother very, very much.","As a general rule, I don't plan to travel with my Oscars, but we may have to make an exception.","I was trying to talk about where we are right now as a society, and talk about the fear we all live in, and certainly since 9-11, how it's affected us and the world.","We all have these tendencies in us that could go this way or that. I think that's the real key in writing. To look at a character without judgment.","We give you characters we'd feel very comfortable judging, and then go: 'Oh yeah? Watch this'.","'Crash' was incredibly personal to me. So was 'In the Valley of Elah.' There were things in 'The Next Three Days' that were questions I was asking myself but couldn't answer, like how far would you go for love? Can you believe in somebody who can't even believe in themselves? But this is highly personal.","I loved American filmmakers when I was growing up. I didn't get to film school or anything. I was a very bad student. I just devoured film, but there was a point in my teens when I started to run a little film society.","I don't know how much credit I can take for 'Walker, Texas Ranger,' because I only worked on it for three weeks. I re-wrote the pilot, and then my name was on it forever.","When I discovered European filmmakers, it affected me so deeply. It redefined what cinema could be. I mean, 'Blow-Up' ends with a dead body and mimes playing tennis. What?","I just figure if you have a modicum of celebrity, you need to use it, and you need to use it for more things than just promoting yourself or your film or your image or your product.","I made a very good living as a bad writer. I wrote a lot of comedies, 'Diff'rent Strokes,' 'Facts of Life,' while all my friends were doing the good shows, like 'Cheers,' but I loved it because I got to be a working writer in Hollywood.","Even in a comedy, you have to make people feel. You have to put your hand inside their soul and twist out their heart.","I don't pay much attention to the press. My films always get good reviews and bad reviews. I just try to make the best film I can.","There's nothing more painful than writing.","The great majority of Scientologists I know are good people who are genuinely interested in improving conditions on this planet and helping others.","Every 10 years, I know less about love and relationships. The smarter I get, the less I know.","I like taking genres and subverting them. I did that with 'In the Valley of Elah.' I said, 'Okay, this is just a murder mystery. Relax.' And then, two thirds of the way through, I broke every convention of a murder mystery.","I try not to think of actors as I'm writing because I think you do them a disservice by writing for things they've already done.","I just love actors, and I've always loved actors. I empathize with their job. Everyone thinks it's easy, and it ain't. To be that vulnerable and brave on camera is tough. The more they reveal themselves, the more we love them, but there's a lot of truth in what they're showing.","I'm a deeply broken person, and broken institutions fascinate me.","In Scientology, in the Ethics Conditions, as you go down from Normal through Doubt, then you get to Enemy, and, finally, near the bottom, there is Treason.","I have so many questions about love. How do you win at it? Especially if you're in a relationship with an impossible person? What if you believe in someone who's completely untrustworthy, who at their core can't even believe in themselves?","My kids paid the price for my career. We can say it's for our family, but it almost never is. It's about us. It's just some of us can pretend better than others.","Even a modicum of celebrity is hard to deal with. You see it with actors and directors all the time.","I'm such an antsy type of person. I can't write in a room without other people around. I write in coffee shops.","I like it when an actor is secure enough to ask questions, and the director is secure enough not to be threatened by that.","Irish and Italian are my two favourite people.","I'm a filmmaker, and I was most influenced by Hitchcock's films. How he could plant such deep enriched characters and then make us care both about the antagonist and protagonist was masterful.","You can't plan for people to like your movies. I knew that people were not going to run in droves to the theater for the 'In the Valley of Elah.' I knew they might not want to see it, but I still had to the movie; I felt very strongly about it. Wanting to keep telling a good story is what you want to do, a compelling story.","I don't know if 'Crash' is a good movie or not because I didn't set out to make a movie. Really, what I wanted to do is more of a social experiment.","I thought 'The King's Speech' was great.","I have never pretended to be the best Scientologist, but I openly and vigorously defended the church whenever it was criticized, as I railed against the kind of intolerance that I believed was directed against it. I had my disagreements, but I dealt with them internally.","I don't think I'm against all wars, but you'd have to have a damn good reason to send your son or daughter to fight, or to go yourself. So often, we are lied to and manipulated by our governments for their own very cynical reasons.","You don't make a film because the audience is ready for it. You make a film because you have questions that are in your gut.","My one guiding rule for success in the film world would be, be careful of your friends.","I moved to Hollywood when I was 22. I was married. I had a kid right away. And I had worked as a furniture mover amongst various other jobs, and I'd work eight, ten hours a day to support my family - and I'd come home and write for two hours a night or two and a half, or three hours a night.","All my work is partly biographical. I mean, 'Crash' was absolutely that, absolutely. But you just wouldn't recognize me in most of those characters. But I was in every single one of those characters in 'Crash,' because those were all fears that I had felt. Things that I had thought in my deepest, darkest heart.","In 'The Next Three Days,' even though it was a prison breakout movie, I was asking myself, 'What would I do? How far would I go for the woman I loved? How far would I go, and what would I do when the person then told me that they were guilty? Could I still believe in them?' So it was very personal.","A lot of films made me love the movies, everything from Hitchcock to Godard. But the ones that really grabbed me were Costa-Gavras's films like 'Z' and 'State of Siege.'","The worst thing you can do to a filmmaker is to walk out of his film and go, 'That was a nice movie.' But if you can cause people to walk out and then argue about the film on the sidewalk... I think we're all seeking dissension, and we love to affect an audience.","As artists, we have to be brave. If we aren't brave, we aren't artists."],"Paul Harding":["Contrary to all those times you've heard a writer confess at a reading that he writes fiction because he is a pathological liar, fiction writing is all about telling the truth.","I worry that if whatever pops into your head at any instant immediately goes online, you lose the crucial time for your thoughts to simmer and evolve and build up nuance, depth and empathy.","Don't confine truth to fact. Imaginative truth is as powerful, and often enough, more so than fact.","I was just delighted to be a legitimate, for-real published author.","I'm no online whiz, but I'm not a Luddite, either. I love that we have these laptops and tablets and smart phones; they're awesome and convenient and all that. It's more about maintaining balance. Technology should always be a predicate of the true subject: our individual humanity, our examined lives.","The fictional world seems larger, seems to have more dimension and richness when, for example, the protagonist from one novel you've read has a cameo role in another. I think that recognition is a very, very powerful phenomenon; it is one of the deepest and greatest pleasures of reading.","The silver lining of those years when I was trying to get 'Tinkers' published but couldn't were the years when I had to decide, Why do I want to be a writer? I realized that writing is the thing itself; writing is not a means to publication, writing is not a predicate of publication, so I spent years making art for art's sake.","If you want to be a writer, you write. Everybody wants to get published. You gotta play your long game.","Write as precisely and as lucidly and as richly as you can about what you find truly mysterious and irreducible about human experience, and not obscurely about what will prove to be received opinion or cliche once the reader figures out your stylistic conceit. There's all the difference in the world between mystery and mystification.","Don't write your books for people who won't like them. Give yourself wholly to the kind of book you want to write, and don't try to please readers who like something different."],"Paul Harris":["Personality has power to uplift, power to depress, power to curse, and power to bless.","Segregation never brought anyone anything except trouble.","It has been the way of Rotary to focus thought upon matters in which members are in agreement, rather than upon matters in which they are in disagreement.","When an individual, a sect, a clique or a nation hates and despises another individual, sect, clique or nation, he or they simply do not know the objects of their hatred. Ignorance is at the bottom of it.","Motherhood is at its best when the tender chords of sympathy have been touched.","Singing is not indulged in by Rotary clubs of some countries and all clubs are given full privilege to do as they please about including it in their programs.","Ignorance is a menace to peace.","The less one knows, the more he thinks he knows, and the more willing he is to employ any and all measures to enforce his views upon others.","In the clashes between ignorance and intelligence, ignorance is generally the aggressor.","Individuals and nations owe it to themselves and the world to become informed.","Ideas have unhinged the gates of empires.","The higher the general average of intelligence, all things else being equal, the less the disposition to be meddlesome, critical, and overbearing.","Many obstacles to the expansion of good will have presented themselves.","The very strength of a nation eventually proves to be its weakness.","Descendants of New England pioneers are proud of their ancestry and glad to proclaim the fact that so far as the United States are concerned, New England is in deed the cradle of religious liberty.","In the cold, shivering twilight, preceding the daybreak of civilization, the dominating emotion of man was fear.","The nation that is supreme above all others during one age, will be eclipsed by another in the next age.","It did not come naturally; in fact, it would be difficult to conceive of any more dogmatic and less tolerant people than the first settlers on New England shores.","The lawlessness of frontier life in America has been pictured as a remarkable phenomenon. In reality, it was the natural consequence of indiscriminate mixing of volatile substances.","It would not be fair to the critics of Rotary, who include some of the most brilliant of the British and American writers, to charge them with prejudice.","In course of time, religion came with its rites invoking the aid of good spirits which were even more powerful than the bad spirits, and thus for the time being tempered the agony of fears.","But primitive man had enemies real as well as imaginary, and they were not subject to priestly sorceries.","There is nothing in the genius of America more precious today than the spirit of religious and political tolerance in its application to our own people.","If there ever was a militant religion, it was that of early New England.","While the struggle for religious liberty had proceeded without large-scale bloodshed in New England and elsewhere in the United States, the struggle for political liberty had not fared so well.","If there is anything worse than international warfare, is civil warfare, and the United States was destined to experience it in the extreme of bitterness.","Much responsibility rests upon the shoulders of the song leader; it is not infrequently within his power to make or break a meeting.","To attempt to superimpose its views through the exercise of force, is seldom the part of intelligence; it is frequently the part of ignorance.","One's religion is one's own possession and he has a right to it.","One's nativity is not of his own choosing, but whatever it may be, it is entitled to respect; and all nations have honorable place in the world's family.","Permanent superiority has never been realized by any nation in history. After the rise comes the fall.","How strange it is that murder has the sanction of law in one and only one of the human relationships, and that is the most important of all, that of nation to nation."],"Paul Harvey":["Golf is a game in which you yell 'fore,' shoot six, and write down five.","Ever since I made tomorrow my favorite day, I've been uncomfortable looking back.","In times like these, it helps to recall that there have always been times like these.","If 'pro' is the opposite of 'con' what is the opposite of 'progress'?","Self-government won't work without self-discipline.","A policeman must know everything - and not tell. He must know where all the sin is and not partake.","Ever occur to you why some of us can be this much concerned with animals suffering? Because government is not. Why not? Animals don't vote.","I've never seen a monument erected to a pessimist.","Now you know the rest of the story.","Government has to be cut back like asparagus... every day... or it gets away and goes to seed. Ours did. When there's too much of it, the flower becomes a weed.","When America's early pioneers first turned their eyes toward the West, they did not demand that somebody take care of them if they got ill or got old. They did not demand maximum pay for minimum work, and even pay for no work at all.","Every pessimist who ever lived has been buried in an unmarked grave. Tomorrow has always been better than today, and it always will be.","One vote. That's a big weapon you have there, Mister. In 1948, just one additional vote in each precinct would have elected Dewey. In 1960, one vote in each precinct in Illinois would have elected Nixon. One vote.","When your outgo exceeds your income, the upshot may be your downfall.","Cut out the free feed for the boss hogs at the public trough and the spill-over they've been leaving us. We'll manage.","Like what you do. If you don't like it, do something else.","As industry's tycoons of the Thirties got their wings clipped, labor's leaders in the Eighties are getting their wings clipped. Not because of any class-related antagonism, but because any excess, ultimately, is its own undoing.","I am fiercely loyal to those willing to put their money where my mouth is.","Retiring is just practicing up to be dead. That doesn't take any practice.","We were poor, but we didn't know it. There were no government bureaus in those days presuming to determine where poorness begins and ends, but I don't remember ever being hungry.","If there is a 50-50 chance that something can go wrong, then 9 times out of ten it will.","Dependency arguments often come from elites - either aid agencies or governments - and say something about attitudes to poor people.","I was never one who sought to make the small man tall by cutting off the legs of a giant. I wanted to drag no man down to my size. Only to preserve a way of life which might make it possible for me, one day, to elevate myself until I at least partly matched his size.","What is a policeman made of? He, of all men, is once the most needed and the most unwanted. He's a strangely nameless creature who is 'Sir' to his face and 'Fuzz' to his back.","The policeman must be a minister, a social worker, a diplomat, a tough guy, and a gentleman. And, of course, he'd have to be a genius... For he will have to feed a family on a policeman's salary."],"Paul Hawken":["Good management is the art of making problems so interesting and their solutions so constructive that everyone wants to get to work and deal with them.","Sustainability, ensuring the future of life on Earth, is an infinite game, the endless expression of generosity on behalf of all.","Always leave enough time in your life to do something that makes you happy, satisfied, even joyous. That has more of an effect on economic well-being than any other single factor.","Hindered by asthma since I was six weeks old, I had begun experimenting with my diet and discovered a disquieting correlation. When I stopped eating the normal American diet of sugar, fats, alcohol, chemicals, and additives, I felt better. I could breathe freely. When I tried to sneak in a hamburger and a Coke, my body rebelled.","We need to revise our economic thinking to give full value to our natural resources. This revised economics will stabilize both the theory and the practice of free-market capitalism. It will provide business and public policy with a powerful new tool for economic development, profitability, and the promotion of the public good.","Most floods are caused by man, not weather; deforestation, levee construction, erosion, and overgrazing all result in the loss of ecosystem services.","Biological diversity is messy. It walks, it crawls, it swims, it swoops, it buzzes. But extinction is silent, and it has no voice other than our own.","What I see everywhere in the world are ordinary people willing to confront despair, power, and incalculable odds in order to restore some semblance of grace, justice, and beauty to this world.","The first rule of sustainability is to align with natural forces, or at least not try to defy them.","All is connected... no one thing can change by itself.","There is no cost difference between incarceration and an Ivy League education; the main difference is curriculum.","We have the capacity to create a remarkably different economy: one that can restore ecosystems and protect the environment while bringing forth innovation, prosperity, meaningful work, and true security.","Green business is not about tie-dyed T-shirts. It's about transforming the industrial system itself into one that looks at all the connections.","This planet came with a set of instructions, but we seem to have misplaced them. Civilization needs a new operating system.","We assume that everything's becoming more efficient, and in an immediate sense that's true; our lives are better in many ways. But that improvement has been gained through a massively inefficient use of natural resources.","Money and prices and markets don't give us exact information about how much our suburbs, freeways, and spandex cost. Instead, everything else is giving us accurate information: our beleaguered air and watersheds, our overworked soils, our decimated inner cities. All of these provide information our prices should be giving us but do not.","Commercial institutions, proud of their achievements, do not see that healthy living systems - clean air and water, healthy soil, stable climates - are integral to a functioning economy. As our living systems deteriorate, traditional forecasting and business economics become the equivalent of house rules on a sinking cruise ship.","You can print money to bail out a bank, but you can't print life to bail out a planet.","The atmosphere does not fathom whether CO2 comes from U.S. oil or Chinese coal, nor do hurricanes lose force because the Heritage Foundation doesn't believe global warming is a problem. Living systems operate on laws over which we have no say.","For the developed world, there is a choice to be made: to promote economic policies that despoil indigenous lands or to support cultures and the remaining biological sanctuaries.","Real change occurs from the bottom up; it occurs person to person, and it almost always occurs in small groups and locales and then bubbles up and aggregates to larger vectors of change.","Somewhere along the way to free-market capitalism, the United States became the most wasteful society on the planet.","I doubt very much that the chief executives of any of the Fortune 500 corporations can name five edible plants, five native grasses, or five migratory birds within walking distance of their homes, or name the soil series upon which their house sits. And I would contend that if you don't know where you are, you are in fact nowhere at all.","We have to ask ourselves, 'What kind of world is it where a baby-food executive substitutes artificial flavoring and sugar for apple juice? What kind of businesses have we created when we even lie to infants?'","Business is destroying the world, with flair, expertise, and panache.","When cattle ranchers clear rain forests to raise beef to sell to fast-food chains that make hamburgers to sell to Americans, who have the highest rate of heart disease in the world (and spend the most money per GNP on health care), we can say easily that business is no longer developing the world. We have become its predator.","Interestingly, the oil companies know very well that in less than 30 years they will not only be charging very high prices, but that they will be uncompetitive with renewables.","A local company has more accountability.","And also, more and more businesses really want to do the right thing. They feel better about themselves, their workers feel better, and so do their customers. I think this is equally true in the transnational corporations, but it is harder to express in those situations.","Businesses who are members of Businesses for Social Responsibility or the Social Venture Network are internalizing costs on a voluntary basis and therefore raising their costs of doing business, but their competitors are not required to.","I think an old style of addressing environmental problems is ebbing, but the rise of the so-called conservative, political movement in this country is not a trend towards the future but a reaction to this very broad shift that we are undergoing.","If, as is natural, you focus on the corruption and on those threatened institutions that are trying to prevent change - even though they don't really know what they're trying to prevent - then you can get pessimistic.","In short, industrialism is over.","Information from destructive activities going back a hundred years right up until today is being incorporated into the system. And as that happens the underlying framework of industrialism is collapsing and causing disintegration.","Intelligent policies will be largely self-regulating in the sense that the system of incentives and standards makes it absolutely ludicrous to not move towards clean, internalized systems of cost and production.","Local companies don't have to internalize their costs, and few actually do, but they tend to more often because the owners live there and they have to show their face in town, and their kids play with other kids.","People are naming it the Third Wave, the Information Age, etc. but I would say those are basically technological descriptions, and this next shift is not about technology - although obviously it will be influenced and in some cases expressed by technologies.","That appropriation of resources and the transformation of them into goods and services through the European production system characterized, and characterizes to this day, all industrial systems including the information age.","That inefficiency is masked because growth and progress are measured in money, and money does not give us information about ecological systems, it only gives information about financial systems.","The financial capital is being concentrated by corporations, institutional investors, and even our pension funds, and being reinvested in companies that repeat this process because it provides the highest return on that financial capital.","Thus, the forces and value systems that are most threatened by this shift are becoming the most coherent and are rising to the top as minority or plurality powers. But they do not represent either the shift, the change, or the future.","We are losing our living systems, social systems, cultural systems, governing systems, stability, and our constitutional health, and we're surrendering it all at the same time.","We are now heading down a centuries-long path toward increasing the productivity of our natural capital - the resource systems upon which we depend to live - instead of our human capital.","We can no longer prosper by increasing human productivity. The more we try to do, the more poverty we will create.","What we are missing, utterly and completely, in this government is accountability.","Writing is my way of diving deep into an issue. My approach is to watch, read and listen - sometimes for years - in order to grasp the dynamics, resistance and patterns of thought that repeat and impede progress and breakthrough.","Really, the proper study of economics is fulfilment, not consumption... It doesn't even matter if it's a green product or a green house... It's still consumption. What matters in this world is the fulfilment of people's needs and the fulfilment of their aspirations.","Natural capital is easy to overlook because it is the pond we swim in. One can live perfectly well without ever giving a thought to the sulfur cycle or wetland functions. Only when the benefits nature provides are disrupted do we take notice.","The United States prides itself on being the richest country in the world. Yet we can't balance the budget, pay for education, or take care of the aged and infirm.","Throughout the industrial era, economists considered manufactured capital - money, factories, etc. - the principal factor in industrial production, and perceived natural capital as a marginal contributor. The exclusion of natural capital from balance sheets was an understandable omission. There was so much of it, it didn't seem worth counting.","It is possible for the assembly-line worker consigned to tightening the bolts on the transmission and the office worker who processes medical insurance claims to work with pride and efficiency, but it's not easy to maintain that attitude.","The self-owned and -operated business is the freest life in the world.","Seeing the world around you clearly is a critical step in developing an idea for a business, carrying out that idea, and then thriving with an ongoing concern. Through choice, predilection, lack of education, impatience, or other causes, the entrepreneur lives, in a way, outside the mainstream.","Don't be put off by people who know what is not possible. Do what needs to be done, and check to see if it was impossible only after you are done.","When asked if I am pessimistic or optimistic about the future, my answer is always the same: If you look at the science about what is happening on Earth and aren't pessimistic, you don't understand the data.","We are the only species on the planet without full employment. Brilliant.","Trees are being saved because of the Kindle.","Class of 2009: you are going to have to figure out what it means to be a human being on Earth at a time when every living system is declining, and the rate of decline is accelerating. Kind of a mind-boggling situation... but not one peer-reviewed paper published in the last thirty years can refute that statement.","Enslaving each other was what human beings had done for ages. And the abolitionist movement was greeted with incredulity. Conservative spokesmen ridiculed the abolitionists as liberals, progressives, do-gooders, meddlers, and activists.","We have an economy that tells us that it is cheaper to destroy Earth in real time rather than renew, restore, and sustain it.","We're trained to see the world in terms of charismatic organizations and charismatic people. That's who we look to for leadership and change, for transformation. We're awaiting the next J.F.K., the next Martin Luther King, the next Gandhi, the next Nelson Mandela.","When you pollute a river, it's a supreme injustice to those who are downstream and those who live in the river who are not human beings.","Yes, population is a huge problem - birth rates are too high. And in order to take care of the environment, we have to make sure that every child that comes here, that arrives, knows that he or she is welcome, is going to be cared for and honored.","There is no polite way to say that business is destroying the world.","The responses that environmentalists evoke - fear, anxiety, numbness, despair - are not helpful, even if they are understandable. It should be fascinating, even enthralling, to be in the milieu of environmental change."],"Paul Henderson":["I get up every morning and it's going to be a great day. You never know when it's going to be over so I refuse to have a bad day.","When fairy tales are written in the west, they're known as folklore. In the east, fairy tales are called religions.","Contentment does not come from achievement.","My wife and I really enjoy a glass of red wine. We're too old to drink cheap wine, and we don't.","Contentment does not come from achievement. It comes from a relationship with the Lord.","When you have hope, and you have peace, you can handle anything.","When you have cancer, you can define the trivial from the important very quickly.","I didn't handle fame very well at first. I got a little resentful.","The Lord expects us to enjoy our lives. He says there will be some brutal times, but we shouldn't get all bent out of shape about it.","I'm so proud to be Canadian. I've been to 58 countries, and they're wonderful countries, but Canada is the best.","I don't eat fast food any more, not since I got cancer.","I'm pretty transparent and have no problem sharing my weaknesses.","Pride is about the ugliest trait somebody can have.","I'm a very, very proud Canadian, and having the privilege to represent my country on the international level was the highlight of my 18-year career.","My philosophy is I take today, live it the best way I can and if I wake up I'll take another shot at tomorrow.","My philosophy, don't let cancer ruin your life. You get up every day and use what you have and what time you have left.","I always thought Christians were the weak people. When you can't make it in life then you have to ask God. I really prided myself on being a self-made man.","There is no wrinkle-free life.","The Bible says not to worry so I don't. I just get up in the morning and ask God for help to get through the day. If tomorrow shows up then I'll take the same shot tomorrow.","After I started to understand the spiritual dimension of life, I understood the responsibilities you have as a husband, a father, a friend and a hockey player.","I get as much fan mail today and sign as many autographs as I did when I played. It's mind-boggling to a certain degree.","I have never been worried because when you have hope and peace, you can handle anything.","I think having the cancer allowed me to be able to freely talk about my faith.","Cancer is cancer. I've got a great life if I can just stay alive.","You can say what you want about me, but don't mess with my wife.","We grew up very poor, and I hated being poor. I was the oldest of five kids, and I never got a pair of skates until I was nine. It was very difficult to get an education back then and play junior hockey.","I just refuse to worry or get upset or be fearful. It doesn't do one particle of good.","I thought happiness came from achievement.","I'm not nearly as important as I used to think I was. It's a wonderful discovery."],"Paul Henreid":["I hate to think of the day when nobody remembers me as an actor and I can't get good tables in restaurants.","I never felt Lee Strasberg could act, and I fail to see how someone who can't act can teach acting."],"Paul Heyse":["After attending the gymnasium between my eighth and seventeenth years, I studied classical philology at Berlin University for two years under Boeckh and Lachmann, and with the friendly support of Emanuel Geibel and Franz Kugler, I dabbled in all sorts of poetry.","In Bonn, where I studied for a year, I changed from classical to Romance philology, taught there by its great founder, F. Diez, and at the beginning of 1852, I received the doctorate for a dissertation on the refrain in Provencal poetry.","I was born in Berlin on March 15, 1830, the second son of the royal university professor K. W. L. Heyse and his wife Julie, nee Saaling, who came from a Jewish family.","In the spring of 1854, some of my publications persuaded King Maximilian II of Bavaria to offer me, at the suggestion of Emanuel Geibel, a position in Munich with an annual salary of 1000 guilders, to take part in his so-called symposia, weekly soirees at which scholars and poets were gathered."],"Paul Hindemith":["There are only two things worth aiming for, good music and a clean conscience.","There are only twelve tones and they need to be treated carefully.","My God, how can anyone ever be a master of music?","People who make music together cannot be enemies, at least while the music lasts."],"Paul Hirsch":["The sound is the key; audiences will accept visual discontinuity much more easily than they'll accept jumps in the sound. If the track makes sense, you can do almost anything visually.","I have always had a certain rhythmic approach to my work.","When I started out, I preferred to watch my films without music, as its presence tends to mask the underlying pace of the film. I felt I could feel the rhythm of the film better without music to influence me.","I have been typecast in my career, although the type changes with the decades."],"Paul Hoffman":["The magic was in the Marshall Plan itself. It provided an opportunity for appealing and constructive work. In a sense, the mission chiefs were given the opportunity to help act as architects for the new Europe that was envisioned.","At the time it seriously troubled me, but in drafting me as Marshall Plan Administrator, President Truman did as great a favor for me as one man can do for another. It opened my eyes to many things of which I was totally unaware and it was the beginning of my real education.","The Europeans had made two promises to the United States if Marshall Plan help was forthcoming. The first promise was maximum self-help on the part of every country; and second, maximum mutual aid.","There are times we are givers, but others time we have to let others give to us.","I would like to say that no man ever was given finer cooperation than that given me by President Truman.","If there was to be a new Europe, there not only had to be a common market, but also great mobility in labor.","The full potential of labor can be utilized only if there is mobility in labor.","We should wage war not to win war, but to win peace.","Among the reasons for this was the fact that the U.S.A. is one mass market. It is only when you have a mass market that large-scale manufacturing which involves very substantial expenditures can be justified.","As far as we were concerned, we were operators, we were administrators. I don't ever recall going to Dean Acheson and asking for any counsel or advice on administration, but I had the greatest respect for him, as I have today.","But I felt that most of us in the world today gave priority to our personal interests.","However, from the very beginning of the program, we made it perfectly clear that we would be out of Europe in four years; that whatever was to be accomplished had to be accomplished in that period of time.","If he had listened to some of his advisors and had tried to make the Marshall Plan a political dumping ground for unqualified politicians, it couldn't have been a success.","In its best prewar year, Europe with almost 300 million people had a gross national product of 150 billion dollars. In that same year, the United States with 150 million people had a gross national product of 300 billion dollars.","Yes, Jean Monnet was the father of the concept of a United States of Europe and his efforts more than those of any other single man helped change the thinking of European leaders."],"Paul Hogan":["The secret to my success is that I bit off more than I could chew and chewed as fast as I could.","You're here to sweat. This program is live. There's about one thousand million people watching you. So, you remember - one wrong word, one foolish gesture and your whole career could go down in flames. Hold that thought and have a nice night.","I was flavour of the year for a couple of years, and then, like everyone else, I faded into obscurity. I didn't car;, I loved it.","Come and say G'day!","There's a bit of truth in everything I do, you know.","I'd never walked on snow 'til I was 50, you know. There's no snow where I come from.","'Crocodile Dundee' is about people; it's 10 seconds about crocodiles.","It's got more cosmopolitan, and it's lost its uniqueness, but Australia is still a great place.","Cricket needs brightening up a bit. My solution is to let the players drink at the beginning of the game, not after. It always works in our picnic matches.","Well, there's nothing strange about Americans as a whole. But, Angelinos are different!","I only work every couple of years. I go into retirement between films.","What career? A man's got a body of film of about four movies in about 10 years or something. I do it because I think I can do a good job of something and I'll enjoy it, do it, and sort of vanish. I don't want to be an actor for hire.","I didn't get into entertainment until I was like 31. I didn't star in a movie until I was 46.","I enjoy being part of the entertainment industry, although I'm the laziest person that I've met yet in this business.","People don't hassle me. It's always very friendly anywhere in the world.","I'm not an aspiring young actor; I'm a storyteller who made it late in life, and I'm therefore an inspiration to everyone who thinks that, at 23, if you're not in the Backstreet Boys, then you're never gonna make it.","There are quite a few actors in the business who are much more difficult than kids or monkeys.","Rich and famous is not bad, but poor and famous sucks.","I don't like rehearsing.","I'm the only person who's ever opened the Oscars or done a spot on the Oscars without a script and having it on autocue."],"Paul Hollywood":["I love the sensation of being out in the open air, far away from all the distractions of modern life. I will usually disappear for a couple of hours, and that time on my bike is quite sacred, as it's when I do all my serious thinking. Sometimes I will stop off at bikers' cafe and have a bacon sandwich.","My own preferred fitness regime is to use my bicycle.","Baking can be done with a few simple ingredients, so it's about simplicity and nostalgia - people are reminded of their childhood.","Ironically, when I was in Dubai with the BBC 'Good Food Show,' even though it's an urban area, when you see the vast panorama from the top of the Burj Khalifa, it feels remote, as if it's just sprung up out of the desert. I like Dubai. I didn't think I would, but the food and the people were great.","Civilisation was built around wheat, around people settling down and not being nomadic. Baking is one of the oldest professions.","A sponge is quite simple. You weigh ingredients, mix, and put it in the oven. With pastry, you manhandle it, shape it, fold it. You have to be involved with it; there is more jeopardy, more risk. But it's like making a casserole. There's a flurry of activity to begin with; then it's about leaving it to rest.","I've seen so many kids walking to school with these massive high energy drinks, and they are nine or 10. I'm like, 'What?' It was a treat for me. It is still a treat for my family.","Everyone has a favourite cake, pastry, pudding or pie from when they were kids.","To make a full-blooded puff pastry, you need time, you need patience, and you need precision. It's all about the lamination: it's all about building up the layers of butter, dough, butter, dough; as the butter melts, it creates steam, and that brings up the layers of the two doughs apart from each other, and that's what gives it the rise.","I have gone through some bad times with my own business. At one point, I was working my socks off, driving, delivering, baking. It was hard, hard work. But I worked through it. Running your own bakery is hard. I never came close to bankruptcy, but I had to cut back on staff.","I sometimes worry that by encouraging so many more people to try their hand at baking through 'The Great British Bake Off,' I'm going to find myself in court one day charged with accelerating the national epidemic of obesity! To which I will plead not guilty. A slice of Victoria sandwich is never going to harm anyone.","I drove from Naples to the Amalfi coast in an Alpha Romeo 1969 Spider, which was lovely. There have been lots of movies made down there, and I felt a bit like James Bond - the driving is quite hairy. The locals have mopeds, but you wouldn't catch me on a bike on those roads. A tank would be safer!","Naples is curiously chaotic and, if I'm honest, a bit dilapidated. It certainly has a 'lived-in' look. It's alive, it's vibrant, it's a little bit dirty, it's busy, and I loved it. I felt like this was how Rome would probably have been 2,000 years ago. There's a real bustle, and it's down and dirty.","Dad was a baker, and we lived above the bakery, so I was always popping down to have an apple pie or a doughnut or a custard or gypsy tart: I had a very sweet tooth, and I think that that was what got me into doing what I do now.","One day, I'll disappear and hide in a corner of Britain. I'll own a bakery in a village, live above it, have a big garden because I like mowing. I want to get up when I feel like it, let people queue for my products, and when they're gone, shut the shop and think about tomorrow. Creating magic - that's my dream. And I'll do it.","In recent years, I've begun the year by driving across France to the Alps, abandoning the January gloom for Alpine winter sun, even if the ski-goggles do give you panda marks when you get a tan. As a child, I was always a bit of a billygoat when I'd go camping with my mates in North Wales, around Snowdonia.","Making cake is one of the easiest things in the world.","I love Rome for their calzones and New York City for the variety of quality eateries, but I absolutely fell in love with Miami for the stone crabs at Joe's just off Ocean Drive - the best I've ever had, and the Cajun food. The steaks out there are colossal - it's like having a shark and a cow on your plate.","Baking is therapy.","I want to pass on my secrets to people who are going to say, 'I have realised that I love baking, and now I'm going to make my bread and sell it at the local farmers' market,' or who might say, 'I am going to use the local Post Office in our village to sell my cakes.' I want to give them that little bit of fire.","Years ago, I saw a job for head baker for The Dorchester Hotel in London, and I didn't want to move away from the North West. But then I thought, 'I've got to do this for my career,' because I was very ambitious. So I went for it and got the job.","For me, it is always part of my holiday to go and work my way along the shelf in the local artisan bakery with its breads, savoury tartlets, pastries and cakes. It is soul food: one of those things that tells you about a place and the history of a place and its people.","I think baking's far easier than cooking, and because of that, it's more approachable.","I was filming in Roscrea in Co Tipperary. I had great fun watching monks in the monastery there making bread. They even offered me a job as their main baker. One of them said I would make a good monk, but I told him there was a slight problem because I was married.","I grew up to the smell of doughnuts, scones, pies, and bread.","My first job at the bakery was jamming doughnuts.","Since I was a kid, baking has been part of my life.","Some people seem to think their oven self-cleans, but you need to clean it to stop things getting blocked up so you get a good rotation of air and heat inside. Get a probe to test the oven is reaching what it says it's reaching too.","It's been a huge part of my life in the past few years, and I just couldn't turn my back on all that - the bakers themselves, the bakes, the team that makes it, and of course the tent, the bunting, and who could forget... the squirrels. So I am delighted that I will be continuing as a judge when 'Bake Off' moves to Channel 4.","I love France. It's got the sun down at the bottom, the Alps for skiing, and all that wine and food.","When my career in hotels was taking off in the Nineties, I went to work as a head baker in Cyprus, where I was making Danish pastries every day. I can remember that the head chef was always on my back to put more seasonal fruits in with the creme patissiere. I'd even make them with rhubarb.","There's something clean, simple, and even detoxifying about a loaf that contains nothing more than the best stone-ground, whole-meal flour, salt, yeast and water.","It's a great thing because I've said to my lad, 'What do you want to do today - football, shopping, playing a game?' and he says, 'I want to bake with you, Dad.' And he loves it, baking with me.","I'm quite shy, really. The figure you see on TV, that's just a persona. I like getting home, putting my feet up, getting into my slippers and dressing gown.","The sugar tax is fine. I agree with that. But I think it probably doesn't go too far. But then, I work on 'The Great British Bake Off.' We make cakes with sugar and butter. I can't be too critical. It is like anything in life: it is all about moderation.","I can be a romantic. The way to every woman's heart is through her stomach. Food is at the core of everything.","I love evangelising about baking and passing the word on, and I will carry on doing that.","I don't believe in diets. They don't necessarily work. What they do is scrub your weight down, but as soon as you finish, you naturally go back up. I keep everything in my diet - gluten and sugar - I just cut it down a little bit and train more. It's not rocket science.","Crumpets I make myself. I love crumpets. You can't beat a good home-made crumpet.","My dad made these dough balls and covered them up with a cloth in front of a gas fire, which was stuck on a wall. They were rising. In my head, I think they were the best rolls I've ever had. If there was a starting point for me, that was it.","I can't go to sleep on a train anymore because people take photos of me. You know, dribbling. It's a bit embarrassing. I go to sleep with my collar up.","The key thing is to educate not just kids but adults about what goes into food. You do that in any way you can, bread machine or not.","I still pinch myself that I have a second-hand Aston Martin DBS Volante, the convertible model of James Bond's car from 'Quantum of Solace' and 'Casino Royale.'","We didn't travel much when I was little - most of what we did was visit various campsites around Conway, north Wales. My first major holiday abroad was to Ibiza with my parents when I was five. I vividly remember the plane touching down and that the hotel had great swings with lots of little lizards darting about that I was determined to catch.","It's the polar opposite of most people, but I absolutely hate carrying a ton of stuff onto a plane. I check in all my luggage and literally go through security with nothing other than my coat, in which I have my iPhone and iPad.","I find dealing with tempered chocolate a bit tricky, but that's a chocolatier's job. So I dabble, but I wouldn't profess to be good at it.","Anything that has more buttercream than it does cake is going to be a no-no for me.","I don't feel 50. I'm still ambitious, and I've only just got my licence to race sports cars. I race for an Aston Martin team called Beechdean, and it's a huge challenge.","I get embarrassed on the red carpet at awards ceremonies. The whole celebrity thing is embarrassing.","'The Great British Bake Off' has brought baking to the nation, and we've seen people from all walks of life and backgrounds experience the highs and lows of competition and, more importantly, helping each other.","Get digital scales because, for baking, balance scales just aren't accurate enough: it's all in the weighing up.","You can't beat a good doughnut. It has to be a jam one with light pastry and caster sugar on the outside. If I'm really tired, I have to hunt one down, because it gives me that sugar rush to keep me going.","I can judge a restaurant by its bread: it winds me up that a lot of places buy pre-packed ones in and don't bother putting them in the oven to crisp them up again. And you shouldn't put bread on a side-plate: it needs to be pushed back into the centre of the table.","I've never been on a diet and never will.","I like to remind the contestants where they are by playing the 'Bake Off' theme tune on my phone as they walk into the tent. They freak out, as it suddenly dawns on them that they're on the show.","I have always said I would love to go to America, and with a name like Hollywood, it's perfect isn't it?","I get marriage proposals, maybe one a week. Women do flirt, yes. They just want someone from the telly. They come and talk to you, and I guess baking is more attractive, and so they feel they have something in common with me. But I'm just a man from Liverpool. I enjoy what I do, and if that gets people baking, then even better.","The real Paul Hollywood is shy.","I've been on and off motorbikes most of my life.","I don't know any chef who doesn't like fast food.","I am fascinated by Tudor times.","I lived in Cyprus for six years where I learnt all about flatbreads.","Even I don't always come up to my own standards of perfection.","I do love my full English breakfast, but not every day. What I can't do without first thing in the morning, though, is my Danish pastry or a croissant - anything with a laminated dough, enriched with butter to make it beautifully golden and flaky.","Wherever you go in Europe, you'll find each country has particular flavours in their baked goods. It is one of the big differences between Europe and the United States.","Before I was ever a baker, I was a teacher. Or, at least, that is what I thought I was going to be. After O-levels, I went to art school in Wallasey on the Wirral, and my mate Cavan and I did a teacher training course.","I may demonstrate the various stages of making a loaf on stage, but they don't end up in the final product I lift out of the oven at the end. If it were real food preparation, I'd wear a hair net, a hat, and rubber gloves - not a pretty sight.","New Year's resolutions generally don't work for me. Or I don't work for them. I make them, like everyone else, but I can't think of one I have stuck to for more than 24 hours.","I will never, ever go on a carb-free diet.","I went to Naples to work with one of the best pizza-makers in the world, and guess how long he bakes his pizzas for? He bakes them for 45 seconds. In and out. And they're incredible. Any more than that, and it's no longer considered a pizza. I've been spouting off to people for years - six minutes in an oven.","Like most of Italy, Neapolitans like their food, and there are restaurants everywhere. But to make like a true Neapolitan, grab a pizza from a street vendor and eat it there and then. We tried a pizza that's folded over four times to make it nice and portable, then you eat it straight out of paper, like fish and chips.","I have been a baker for more than 30 years now, and in terms of equipment, all I really need is flour. It still amazes me what a versatile commodity it is, as you can do so many different things with it, and I never tire of trying new blends and recipes.","When I get home at night, I always have a soak in the tub before changing into my dressing gown and slippers.","I get a lot of Tweets from fans of 'The Great British Bake Off' asking me questions about different recipes or baking techniques, and I do enjoying getting back to people whenever I can. But as soon as I get home, I always make a point of turning my phone off, as I think it is really important to be able to unwind at the end of the day."],"Paul Horgan":["The true artist is never afraid of anything - including the glories of the past.","Everybody around me was talented and gave everybody talent. Everybody painted. My mother had a beautiful voice. My father was a marvelous drawing-room actor.","Everybody is a regionalist. Tolstoy is a regionalist - one is where one lives, where one writes.","There is hardly a person alive who does not want to know 'what happened next,' in any context.","He who fears to be out of the mode does not deserve to belong to himself.","The most valuable writers are those in whom we find not themselves, or ourselves, or the fugitive era of their lifetimes, but the common vision of all times.","I couldn't put into a capsule one thing that represents me, I don't think.","It is always edifying for mortals to look at a god.","King Charles, who was also the Holy Roman Emperor, lived and worked in hard bare rooms with no carpets, crowding to the fire in winter, using the window's sunshine in summer.","In many joyfully-admired recent novels, love appears as little more than sex-manual instruction."],"Paul Horn":["Basically, I like to pick up my flute, which is a pretty instrument, and play pretty on it.","Music is that universal language which unifies the spirits of mankind.","Yes, I played inside the Taj Mahal, but the experience was also a quiet, inner experience.","We are journeying externally from country to country. We are traveling in historical time, from the present to the distant past. We are traveling inwardly as well, through the music of meditation.","New Age music does something wonderful to the nervous system.","It's funny to find there are still people around who think if a musician has schooling, it automatically makes him a lesser jazz player. But you don't learn jazz in school.","Jazz is a way of life, and you have to learn about it on the street, so to speak. But the training comes in by giving you the tools to work with.","You have to go out and learn jazz by playing.","It was in 1967, and I was on a spiritual pilgrimage to India to study with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. That was before the Beatles saw him, by the way, when not too many people knew of him. Anyway, I visited the Taj and noticed its wonderful sound.","I don't like any category; categories are not my favorite subject. They're too confining.","I'm a romantic. The impressionists have always been my favorites. I like prettiness - beauty, or what I perceive as beauty.","The 'Inside' record definitely opened up a whole new audience.","Even back when I played 'straight-ahead,' I mixed it up. I played some free-form, classical adaptations, solo flute stuff. It was New Age in its own way.","It's not music you can evaluate in traditional ways. If you look around at a concert, you might see what look like bored people, or maybe they're drifting, but they're just having another kind of experience, an inner thing.","We were the first small American jazz group since Sidney Bechet in 1927 to play for the public in Moscow and Leningrad.","After I came out of surgery - I was in the hospital for five weeks - I found that I gravitated toward very gentle sounds: chant music, solo bamboo flute sounds, a laid-back record of my own called 'Inside.' And the music became a very real part of my recovery process.","In 1983, all of us had U.S. passports, but because there was so much tension between America and the U.S.S.R., we were announced as a Canadian group.","The enthusiasm, the adulation for us as jazz artists, in Kiev and Odessa was really heartwarming."],"Paul Hornung":["Never get married in the morning - you never know who you might meet that night."],"Paul Ince":["I love tackling, love it. It's better than sex.","I'm taking it step by step and not thinking at all about a new contract.","The problem is, when you come back in you're sweating, so I wait until the very last minute before putting on my shirt so that it's not covered in sweat.","Liverpool fans were great to me, I still live near the city and they always come up and shake my hand.","It's a shame the Manchester United situation turned sour.","The best player I've ever played with was Paul Gascoigne. He had everything. He was amazing.","Marcel Desailly was pretty hard when I played against him in a Milan derby.","We can't keep playing catch up as we have done for every season I've been here.","We do not want to be giving quality sides such as Southampton, Palace, Norwich and the rest eight or nine points start and expect to get back up with them.","When I retire I'm gonna bet on Wolves drawing every game. I'll be a multi-millionaire!","I don't like publicity, being in the limelight.","I like to knuckle down and get on with my job. I'll make mistakes, I'm bound to, but I'll write them down and I'll learn from them.","I just didn't want to walk away from football without knowing what it meant to be a manager, or even wondering what it was like to be sacked.","It's not just what you do on the pitch, it's what you do off the pitch.","Of course, I will keep myself fit, keep my boots clean and you never know."],"Paul J. Meyer":["Communication - the human connection - is the key to personal and career success.","Productivity is never an accident. It is always the result of a commitment to excellence, intelligent planning, and focused effort.","Crystallize your goals. Make a plan for achieving them and set yourself a deadline. Then, with supreme confidence, determination and disregard for obstacles and other people's criticisms, carry out your plan.","Success is the progressive realization of predetermined, worthwhile, personal goals.","Enthusiasm is the yeast that raises the dough.","Writing crystallizes thought and thought produces action.","Whatever you vividly imagine, ardently desire, sincerely believe, and enthusiastically act upon... must inevitably come to pass!","Enter every activity without giving mental recognition to the possibility of defeat. Concentrate on your strengths, instead of your weaknesses... on your powers, instead of your problems.","Consider every mistake you do make as an asset.","If you are not making the progress that you would like to make and are capable of making, it is simply because your goals are not clearly defined.","Do a little bit more than average and from that point on our progress multiplies itself out of all proportion to the effort put in.","Enthusiasm glows, radiates, permeates and immediately captures everyone's interest.","Mistakes are merely steps up the ladder."],"Paul Jacobs":["People want to be part of something that's bigger than themselves. It's motivating. It helps all of us to work harder.","One of the biggest motivators is to be part of something larger than yourself.","We need students to understand how the world has changed and be prepared to make contributions in a new way."],"Paul Johnson":["As a child I found railroad stations exciting, mysterious, and even beautiful, as indeed they often were.","Is there any possibility of giving international air travel, which we all need and use and hate, a touch of glamour, or even of reliable, soulless efficiency? I suspect future historians will puzzle over our failure. But by then, of course, we shall be in the age of mass space travel, with its fresh and unimaginable crop of horrors.","Euphemism is a human device to conceal the horrors of reality.","Margaret Thatcher had more impact on the world than any woman ruler since Catherine the Great of Russia. Not only did she turn around - decisively - the British economy in the 1980s, she also saw her methods copied in more than 50 countries.","The planet Earth, though not threatened with destruction by man-made global warming, is by no means indestructible. There are many unpredictable events within our solar system, and still more outside it, that could make Earth uninhabitable by humans.","Indeed it is the protean ability of Western civilization to be self-critical and self-correcting - not only in producing wealth but over the whole range of human activities - that constitutes its most decisive superiority over any of its rivals.","In all its myriad manifestations, the language of anti-Semitism through the ages is a dictionary of non-sequiturs and antonyms, a thesaurus of illogic and inconsistency.","Like many physical diseases, anti-Semitism is highly infectious, and can become endemic in certain localities and societies. Though a disease of the mind, it is by no means confined to weak, feeble, or commonplace intellects; as history sadly records, its carriers have included men and women of otherwise powerful and subtle thoughts.","The image of the scientist who puts the pursuit of truth before anything else has been shattered and replaced by a man on the make or a quasi-religious enthusiast who wants to prove his case at any cost. Science is becoming the tool of campaigning warfare, in which truth is the first casualty.","Courage is the essential element in any great public man or woman.","If anti-Semitism is a variety of racism, it is a most peculiar variety, with many unique characteristics. In my view as a historian, it is so peculiar that it deserves to be placed in a quite different category. I would call it an intellectual disease, a disease of the mind, extremely infectious and massively destructive.","Next to courage, willpower is the most important thing in politics.","The most evil person I ever met was a toss-up between Pablo Picasso and the publisher-crook Robert Maxwell.","One of the marvelous things about Churchill is that whatever he was doing, whether fighting or arguing or despairing or bouncing about full of energy, jokes are never far away.","The United States is a concept that works very well, even in bad times. But that's no reason to think its structure can be superimposed with success on any other part of the world, particularly when times are terrible.","What strikes the historian surveying anti-Semitism worldwide over more than two millennia is its fundamental irrationality. It seems to make no sense, any more than malaria or meningitis makes sense.","One of the categories of people I don't like much are intellectuals. People say, 'Oh, you're an intellectual,' and I say, 'No!' What is an intellectual? An intellectual is somebody who thinks ideas are more important than people.","The whole world depends on America ultimately, particularly Britain. And also, I love America - a marvelous country. But in a sense I don't worry about America because I think America has such huge strengths - particularly its freedom of thought and expression - that it's going to survive as a top nation for the foreseeable future.","I like that lady - Sarah Palin. She's great. I like the cut of her jib.","I don't write huge books any more. I used to write 1,000 printed pages, but now I write short books. I did one on Napoleon, 50,000 words - enjoyed doing that. He was a baddie. I did one on Churchill, which was a bestseller in New York, I'm glad to say. 50,000 words. He was a goodie.","I very much wanted to live in Paris when I was in the army, and I was quite determined to. I could have become a dress designer: Dior was willing to take me on as an assistant, but he did not have an immediate vacancy.","When people talk about political correctness, the only element of any value is good manners.","I very much wanted to be editor of the 'New Statesman!' But I never wanted to be prime minister, except maybe as a little boy.","Human beings are infinitely worth studying, especially the peculiarities that often go along with outstanding gifts.","The most intimidating world leader was Lyndon Johnson, who became U.S. President when John Kennedy was assassinated. He exulted in this power and liked to inspire fear.","The idea that human beings have changed and are changing the basic climate system of the Earth through their industrial activities and burning of fossil fuels - the essence of the Greens' theory of global warming - has about as much basis in science as Marxism and Freudianism.","Global warming, like Marxism, is a political theory of actions, demanding compliance with its rules.","Those who buy in to global warming wish to drastically curb human economic and industrial activities, regardless of the consequences for people, especially the poor.","Marxism, Freudianism, global warming. These are proof - of which history offers so many examples - that people can be suckers on a grand scale. To their fanatical followers they are a substitute for religion. Global warming, in particular, is a creed, a faith, a dogma that has little to do with science.","Mr. Obama would be a disheartening president even during a super boom, with his grim demeanor and empty rhetoric, as well as his obvious hatred of business bravado.","Germany's Angela Merkel exudes an atmosphere of elderly exhaustion and pooped-out pessimism. Britain's David Cameron, though by nature exuberant, feels he has to look and sound glum. And France's leader, Francois Hollande, seems determined to drive every successful businessman out of the country.","A capitalist economy hums when leading businessmen are bubbling with animal spirits and are prepared to sink their money into risky ventures.","Long periods of recession, which tend to be self-perpetuating, are usually ended by war, or by preparations for it.","In the past, the U.S. has shown its capacity to reinvent its gifts for leadership. During the 1970s, in the aftermath of the Nixon abdication and the Ford and Carter presidencies, the whole nation peered into the abyss, was horrified by what it saw and elected Ronald Reagan as president, which began a national resurgence.","To many, Heathrow in August is a paradigm of Hell.","The only thing to be said for air travel is speed. It makes possible travel on a scale unimaginable before our present age. Between the ages of 20 and four-score I visited every country in Europe, all save two in Latin America, ditto in Africa, and most of Asia, not counting eight trips to Australia and 60 to the United States - all by air.","In the long term, it is desirable that the human race, faced with the prospect of extinction on Earth, should prepare an escape route for itself to another inhabitable planet.","I was very fond of Princess Diana. She used to have me over to lunch to ask my advice. I'd give her good advice, and she'd say: 'I entirely agree. Paul, you're so right.' Then she'd go and do the opposite.","It would be wrong to say I enjoy having rows, because that would be un-Christian. If people attack me, then I respond, or if they do very wicked things. Then they must be brought to book.","Indeed, the study of universities and the great men and women who have attended them leads me to think that the best of these schools are characterized not so much by what they teach and how they teach it but by the extent they provide opportunities and encouragement for students to teach themselves.","Democracy has many enemies, and the terrorist is only one of them.","At some time in their careers, most good historians itch to write a history of the world, endeavor to discover what makes humanity the most destructive and creative of species.","The freedom enjoyed in Western society under the rule of law and constitutional government explains both the quality of its civilization and its wealth.","Where the quest for knowledge is relatively, and now almost absolutely, unrestrained, the public benefit will be great, especially where the certainty of the law ensures that knowledge is rewarded. This is exactly the combination that is the foundation of wealth-creation."],"Paul Kagame":["We cannot turn the clock back nor can we undo the harm caused, but we have the power to determine the future and to ensure that what happened never happens again.","We must create economic opportunity, build a culture of entrepreneurship, get people to take responsibility for improving their lives, rather than putting them in a position where they sit back in their poverty and blame others for it.","In Africa today, we recognise that trade and investment, and not aid, are pillars of development.","I grew up in a refugee camp. Thirty years. This so-called human-rights world didn't ask me what was happening for me to be there 30 years.","The political, the economic, the social are tied together like the strands of a rope. The social and economic, if they are firm, tend to strengthen the other.","We want to develop this can-do mentality.","I get newspapers from Britain and other countries twice a week and read them almost page to page. Sometimes I find I'm reading things I don't even need to read, because my mind is still hungry.","I'm not British. I'm not American. I'm not French. Whatever thing they practise, that is their business. I am an African. I am Rwandese.","Our world faces difficult challenges, but no more so than in the past. Working together in a constructive spirit, we can assure our children the future they deserve.","There is a need to take advantage of the change that has taken place in the Congo, however tragic that has been in its coming.","Some are short, others are tall, others are thin, others are stocky. But we are all human beings. Can we not live together and happily within one border?","I have no regrets about being who I am and being what I am in my country for my people. No regrets at all.","Africa should not just wait to be exploited or influenced. No. We should be part of the conversation. We should raise ourselves to a level where there are certain terms we dictate in the conversation because we have a lot to offer.","Let no one think that flexibility and a predisposition to compromise is a sign of weakness or a sell-out.","In a state of poverty, illiteracy, people just remain exposed to all kinds of manipulation. That's what we have lived. It's easier to tell a poor person, 'You know what, you are poor, you're hungry because the other one has taken away your rights.'","Such problems are not solved in one day but there is a great step toward peace and security in the region.","There are some who are scared by unity and by building a country on the basis of ideas.","We cannot just be a corridor to smuggle minerals out.","I would be very happy for a woman to succeed me.","I've told Rwandans it's not just what you think of for yourselves, but what others think of us.","Sometimes our partners from other countries ask us why we have not got further with our reconciliation, as if we possess a magic to just get rid of this tragic history of ours.","You kept quiet... When these victims wanted your help to survive, you kept quiet.","You requested me to lead the country again after 2017. Given the importance and consideration you attach to this, I can only accept.","I don't think that what we need is an eternal leader.","I said, maybe you need to take a risk with someone else. But they kept saying no, we want you to stay.","To be effective at delivering a decent life for all, the U.N. must treat all the people it serves with impartiality and respect.","The U.N. must be a good steward of the funds entrusted to it. Abuse and waste are therefore not a mere public relations problem. Institutional reform is not a one-off event, like applying a fresh coat of paint.","The judicial system of Rwanda is not subordinate to France or France's interests.","I try to look at problems very clearly and think, 'How do we get out of this? What will work? What will be the consequences for the people involved?'","Nothing would catch me off guard, because I understand the world I live in. I understand it very well. And the world I live in is not necessarily a fair or just world. I have dealt with these injustices for the bigger part of my life.","I don't think anybody out there in the media, U.N., human rights organisations, has any moral right whatsoever to level any accusations against me or against Rwanda. Because, when it came to the problems facing Rwanda, and the Congo, they were all useless.","You can be up there, talked about, appreciated all over the world, with people singing a lot of songs about you. But if you don't measure up and you are not really connected with your people... it will explode in your face, no question about it."],"Paul Kalanithi":["When there's no place for the scalpel, words are the surgeon's only tool.","The diagnosis was immediate: Masses matting the lungs and deforming the spine. Cancer. In my neurosurgical training, I had reviewed hundreds of scans for fellow doctors to see if surgery offered any hope. I'd scribble in the chart 'Widely metastatic disease - no role for surgery,' and move on. But this scan was different: It was my own.","Science is based on reproducibility and manufactured objectivity. As strong as that makes its ability to generate claims about matter and energy, it also makes scientific knowledge inapplicable to the existential, visceral nature of human life, which is unique and subjective and unpredictable.","During my sojourn in ironclad atheism, the primary arsenal leveled against Christianity had been its failure on empirical grounds. Surely, enlightened reason offered a more coherent cosmos. Surely, Occam's razor cut the faithful free from blind faith. There is no proof of God; therefore, it is unreasonable to believe in God.","A resident's surgical skill is judged by their technique and speed. You can't be sloppy, and you can't be slow.","The physician's duty is not to stave off death or return patients to their old lives, but to take into our arms a patient and family whose lives have disintegrated and work until they can stand back up and face - and make sense of - their own existence.","Before my cancer was diagnosed, I knew that someday I would die, but I didn't know when. After the diagnosis, I knew that someday I would die, but I didn't know when. But now I knew it acutely.","Everyone succumbs to finitude. I suspect I am not the only one who reaches this pluperfect state. Most ambitions are either achieved or abandoned; either way, they belong to the past. The future, instead of the ladder toward the goals of life, flattens out into a perpetual present.","I had spent so much time studying literature at Stanford and the history of medicine at Cambridge in an attempt to better understand the particularities of death, only to come away feeling like they were still unknowable to me.","Before operating on a patient's brain... I must first understand his mind: his identity, his values, what makes his life worth living, and what devastation makes it reasonable to let that life end.","I have sat with countless patients and families to discuss grim prognoses: It's one of the most important jobs physicians have. It's easier when the patient is 94, in the last stages of dementia, and has a severe brain bleed. For young people like me - I am 36 - given a diagnosis of cancer, there aren't many words.","People react differently to hearing 'Procedure X has a 70 percent chance of survival' and 'Procedure Y has a 30 percent chance of death.' Phrased that way, people flock to Procedure X, even though the numbers are the same.","We build scientific theories to organize and manipulate the world, to reduce phenomena into manageable units.","Science may provide the most useful way to organize empirical, reproducible data, but its power to do so is predicated on its inability to grasp the most central aspects of human life: hope, fear, love, hate, beauty, envy, honor, weakness, striving, suffering, virtue.","The good news is that I've already outlived two Brontes, Keats, and Stephen Crane. The bad news is that I haven't written anything.","Putting lifestyle first is how you find a job - not a calling.","What patients seek is not scientific knowledge that doctors hide, but existential authenticity each person must find on her own... the angst of facing mortality has no remedy in probability.","Time for me is double-edged: every day brings me further from the low of my last cancer relapse, but every day also brings me closer to the next cancer recurrence - and eventually, death. Perhaps later than I think, but certainly sooner than I desire.","I knew medicine only by its absence - specifically, the absence of a father growing up: one who went to work before dawn and returned in the dark to a plate of reheated dinner.","The tricky part of illness is that, as you go through it, your values are constantly changing... You may decide you want to spend your time working as a neurosurgeon, but two months later, you may want to learn to play the saxophone or devote yourself to the church. Death may be a one-time event, but living with terminal illness is a process.","Human knowledge is never contained in one person. It grows from the relationships we create between each other and the world, and still, it is never complete.","The root of disaster means a star coming apart, and no image expresses better the look in a patient's eyes when hearing a neurosurgeon's diagnosis.","While all doctors treat diseases, neurosurgeons' work is the crucible of identity. Every operation on the brain is, by necessity, a manipulation of the substance of our selves.","Had I been more religious in my youth, I might have become a pastor, for it was the pastoral role I'd sought.","Words have a longevity that I do not have."],"Paul Kane":["The most terrifying thing I can think of is being alone - and I mean utterly alone, like no one else in the world alone - at night. That's the nucleus of the first story in my collection and it's also where the title came from for the book.","For English assignments I was constantly coming up with these strange adventure stories... But I actually wanted to be an artist, or maybe work in the comic book industry.","I love a good laugh as well, I think that's so important in life, which is probably why I've dabbled in comedy writing as well as horror. I think if you can make someone laugh or smile it's the most special thing in the world.","I can look back at stuff I wrote in my early days and squirm at some of the mistakes I made. But we're all learning every day; we never stop. I just hope people keep on liking what I do. That gives me such a kick.","Unlike life, you've got more or less complete control over what's going on in your stories. That's not to say you can make characters do whatever you want them to - they usually have a life of their own if you've done your job properly.","Some writers would be kinder than others, I'm sure. Hopefully they might describe my techniques as a mixture of tried and tested formulas - if it aint broke don't fix it - and unexpected twists.","I believe that, like most writers, my personality comes through in the fiction. So in that respect my writing can't be like any other author's really.","I've had a lot of very positive feedback about those stories, and seem to have struck upon something that most people feel. I can also tap dance, and don't know many other authors who can.","I also paint, draw and I'm into film and photography as well, and the same thing applies to all of them. You're presenting this material to the general public and hoping that they're going to 'get' what you're doing. Some don't, some do.","Writing can be a very solitary business. It's you sat at a desk typing words into a computer. It can get lonely sometimes and lots of writers live quite isolated lives.","I'm fortunate in that I'm a lecturer too and this gets me out and about and away from the computer. I also have loads of friends all around the world, plus a core group of special people in my life that I can lean on, chat to, or just hang with.","This sort of encouragement is vital for any writer. And lastly the publication of Touching the Flame, which was on hold for two years and went through a few publishers before finding a stable home.","I know it's popular to say this because she's the woman of the moment, but Halle Berry. Not only does she have obvious audience appeal and star quality, but she's a damn good actress too.","Having said that, I'm a huge Jack Nicholson fan because he just goes nuts in everything he does. Having Jack in his heyday would also be a dream come true.","My most intimate secrets? Well, if I told you those they wouldn't be secrets now, would they? Seriously though I don't have too many secrets. I'm a very open and honest person, sometimes too honest for my own good.","As for goals, I don't set myself those anymore. I'm not one of these 'I must have achieved this and that by next year' kind of writers. I take things as they come and find that patience and persistence tend to win out in the end.","Because I'm such a creative person, and I've always got my nose in a book, I suppose it was only a matter of time before non-fiction turned into fiction again. But I never consciously set out to become a writer and I never thought I'd be doing the things I'm doing today.","It was relatively easy to write 'The Cave of Lost Souls', though, because it came to me one night in a dream. I remember waking up and having this idea for a complete story - from start to finish - in my head, so I jotted it down, then later began writing the thing.","I sometimes wonder what would've happened if I'd entered the competition instead - I'd probably have come nowhere and given up on the whole fiction game.","I don't know anyone who actually likes the dark or night-time. I don't care how much they say it doesn't bother them. That's why we used to huddle in caves and light fires when the sun went down.","Sometimes I'll hear a phrase or a word and write it down in my little black notebook (a writer's best mate), then come back to it and work a plot around it."],"Paul Kantner":["If you can remember anything about the sixties, you weren't really there.","Then you get to be involved with all the people, meet all the beautiful girls, get all the good food, get ready and locked in before all the crowds hit.","I think most non-Christians who try to be good people are probably better Christians than Christians.","Maintain yourself and everything maintains itself around you.","You can't just sit around and make protest albums all your life; eventually it comes to the point where you have to do something.","I wouldn't have expected an audience of ours to burn down our equipment.","I don't blame it on the Hell's Angels. I blame it on the people who were there.","I believe the Rolling Stones wanted to play in Golden Gate Park.","One of the main things we learned as a band in those days was not to be the headliner.","Compared to what they were, rock concerts now are like business meetings.","When we toured... I was hungry to take out people like Jeff Beck in front of us; Fleetwood Mac, just before they hit; Heart, just before they hit.","Correcting it, I don't know; just shedding the light of day on it is a first major step, being one of the earliest generations not to just accept the words.","I was raised by the Christian Brothers, who believe in that, fortunately. They were, to me, the most rebellious arm of the Catholic Church - and one of the most liberal and forward thinking.","It's a lot of random situations that combine in a certain volatile form and create a bigger-than- the-whole situation that nobody could have predicted.","You couldn't have fed the '50s into a computer and come out with the '60s.","There's that thing about the '80s, the '40s and the '60s, and the '30s, the '50s and the '70s. Something about those odd decades in this century that weren't too pleasant.","The '80s seem a real positive force. The '70s were deadening, in a lot of ways.","You can't plan for the future, because some guy's going to land in a spaceship with three heads and a big beak and take over everything.","We printed all the words out because otherwise nobody would be able to understand them.","The studio scene in California is sort of ridiculous anyway.","We're giving RCA another record, and that should finish them.","The starship thing is really political action and reaction, the natural outgrowth of Volunteers.","What we're saying now is you have a choice: You can stay, or you can go away."],"Paul Keating":["I've always held the view that great states need strategic space. I mean, George Washington took his space from George III. Britain took it from just about everybody. Russia took all of Eastern Europe. Germany's taken it from everywhere they can, and China will want its space too.","Well, I think that - I think leadership's always been about two main things: imagination and courage.","I think Australia has to be a country which has the 'Welcome' sign out.","You see, psychologically, Australia must understand it has to live in the region around it. Australia must find its security in Asia; it cannot find its security from Asia.","One tires of combat, although I can still throw a punch, you know.","Politicians come in three varieties: straight men, fixers, and maddies.","When the Berlin Wall came down the Americans cried, 'Victory,' and walked off the field.","I think the Australian people are very conscientious. During the 1980s and 1990s we proved they will respond conscientiously to necessary reforms. They mightn't like them but they'll accept them. But reforms have to be presented in a digestible format.","If one takes pride in one's craft, you won't let a good thing die. Risking it through not pushing hard enough is not a humility.","In the end, rational policy is always good.","The great curse of modern political life is incrementalism.","You know, in the WikiLeaks cables, the Chinese discovered that Kevin Rudd was urging the Americans to keep the military option open against them. This is hardly a friendly gesture.","I try to use the Australian idiom to its maximum advantage.","You see, before I became prime minister, the Australian prime minister only attended ever two meetings in the world: the British Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and the South Pacific Forum.","Well, Australians should speak for the national interests of Australia, and whatever role former Australian prime ministers may have, one of the things you do is speak frankly about the country as you see the country's best interests, you know?","I think the rise of China is one of the great events of all economic and human history, and I think this will be overwhelmingly a positive thing for the region and the world.","The United States being in Asia is unambiguously a good thing for the region.","Nobody wants to have in their CV in the upper echelons of the American economic family that they nationalised major banks.","The G7, just a European centric show, an Atlantic show, is fundamentally finished.","The great changes in civilisation and society have been wrought by deeply held beliefs and passion rather than by a process of rational deduction.","You get one chance to do something about native title. You get perhaps one chance in your life to do something about a republic. You get one chance, your chance, to build a piece of the political architecture in the Pacific. I wasn't going to give those up.","I always believed in burning up the government's political capital, not being Mr Safe Guy, you know?","I used to say in the cabinet room, 'confidence is not like a can of Popeye spinach - you can't take the top off and swallow it down.' You know, confidence has to be earned."],"Paul Klee":["A drawing is simply a line going for a walk.","One eye sees, the other feels.","Beauty is as relative as light and dark. Thus, there exists no beautiful woman, none at all, because you are never certain that a still far more beautiful woman will not appear and completely shame the supposed beauty of the first.","A line is a dot that went for a walk.","Children also have artistic ability, and there is wisdom in there having it! The more helpless they are, the more instructive are the examples they furnish us; and they must be preserved free of corruption from an early age.","Color possesses me. I don't have to pursue it. It will possess me always, I know it. That is the meaning of this happy hour: Color and I are one. I am a painter.","The painter should not paint what he sees, but what will be seen.","Art does not reproduce what we see; rather, it makes us see.","Nature is garrulous to the point of confusion, let the artist be truly taciturn.","In the final analysis, a drawing simply is no longer a drawing, no matter how self-sufficient its execution may be. It is a symbol, and the more profoundly the imaginary lines of projection meet higher dimensions, the better.","When looking at any significant work of art, remember that a more significant one probably has had to be sacrificed.","The worst state of affairs is when science begins to concern itself with art.","The art of mastering life is the prerequisite for all further forms of expression, whether they are paintings, sculptures, tragedies, or musical compositions.","A single day is enough to make us a little larger or, another time, a little smaller.","Everything vanishes around me, and works are born as if out of the void. Ripe, graphic fruits fall off. My hand has become the obedient instrument of a remote will.","One does not lash hat lies at a distance. The foibles that we ridicule must at least be a little bit our own. Only then will the work be a part of our own flesh. The garden must be weeded.","He has found his style, when he cannot do otherwise.","To emphasize only the beautiful seems to me to be like a mathematical system that only concerns itself with positive numbers."],"Paul Krugman":["The great thing about fiscal policy is that it has a direct impact and doesn't require you to bind the hands of future policymakers.","I admit it: I had fun watching right-wingers go wild as health reform finally became law.","Debt is one person's liability, but another person's asset.","I don't think I've had any great success in predicting politics or social change, nor have I really tried.","The science fiction world has a lot of people doing seriously imaginative thinking.","The problem isn't that people don't understand how good things are. It's that they know, from personal experience, that things really aren't that good.","We know that advanced economies with stable governments that borrow in their own currency are capable of running up very high levels of debt without crisis.","Social Security is a social insurance program - it is not designed to be the same thing as a 401(k).","I think so long as fossil fuels are cheap, people will use them and it will postpone a movement towards new technologies.","I have friends, political scientists, sociologists, who all share an interest at least in certain kinds of science fiction.","As I've often said, you can shop online and find whatever you're looking for, but bookstores are where you find what you weren't looking for.","The real danger with debt is what happens if lots of people decide, or are forced, to pay it off at the same time.","But Wall Street people are in fact very smart; they're funny, they're not company men who work their way up the chain."],"Paul Kurtz":["The meaning of life is not to be discovered only after death in some hidden, mysterious realm; on the contrary, it can be found by eating the succulent fruit of the Tree of Life and by living in the here and now as fully and creatively as we can.","The government doesn't have to solve everyone's problem here."],"Paul Lauterbur":["By the end of the millennium, despite the continuing excitement of the field, almost thirty years of a detour from chemistry to medical imaging began to pall, and I changed my focus to a field of chemical research, just in time for my past to catch up with me in the form of a Nobel Prize. All detours should be so productive!","With luck, you have other things to do than wait for lightning to strike.","If it doesn't seem possible, nothing much gets done.","I wanted to be free to try any silly thing I decided to do."],"Paul LePage":["If you want a good education, go to private schools. If you can't afford it, tough luck. You can go to the public school.","What I'm trying to say is the Holocaust was a horrific crime against humanity and frankly, I would never want to see that repeated.","I did not come to Augusta to provide lip service. I came to work for the Maine people. I also came to Augusta to root out crooked politicians and government corruption.","We must protect our limited resources for those who are truly in need and who are doing all they can to be self-sufficient.","I care for the poor. I am the one willing to work with the poor and have a safety net we can all depend on and make people understand that nothing in life is free. You have to get back to society.","Donald Trump is a little bit like I am. He says what needs to be said. Most of all, folks, he's not afraid of the United States liberal media. They dislike him nearly as much as they hate me.","The people of Maine were tired of being in debt and tired of being overtaxed.","And my response is 70,000 people in the state of Maine that paid income tax in 2011 will not be paying income tax in 2012.","I'm saying the federal government is taking away the freedom of Americans to make choices.","Too many Mainers are dependent on government handouts. Government dependency has not - and never will - create prosperity.","The best part of my life is I've been hired to work for the people of the state of Maine, and I'm very humble and very proud.","The worst part of my life is newspapers are still alive - sorry, I had to say it.","I was Donald Trump before Donald Trump became popular, so I think I should support him since we're one of the same cloth.","Everybody looks at the negative effects of global warming, but with the ice melting, the Northern Passage has opened up. So maybe, instead of being at the end of the pipeline, we're now at the beginning of a new pipeline.","I went to work at 11 years old. I became governor. It's not a big deal. Work doesn't hurt anybody. I'm all for not allowing a 12-year-old to work 40 hours. But a 12-year-old working eight to 10 hours a week or a 14-year-old working 12 to 15 hours a week is not bad.","My greatest fear in the state of Maine: newspapers. I'm not a fan of newspapers.","You must buy health insurance or pay the new Gestapo - the IRS.","Do I think that the ACA is going to force rationing upon the American people? Yes.","Maine's welfare program is cannibalizing the rest of state government. To all you able-bodied people out there: Get off the couch and get yourself a job.","I understand welfare because I lived it. I understand the difference between a want and a need. The Republican Party promised to bring welfare change. We must deliver on this promise.","Whenever someone forces me to do something against my will, they're infringing upon my freedoms and my liberties. And that's what I think we're doing in Maine when we have fair share, which means that you are required to belong to a union, you're required to pay dues, but you don't want to participate.","I believe if an individual wants to join organized labor and work under a union contract, they should have the legal right to do so. At the same token, a person who does not want to work under organized labor and wants to work should have the ability to do so without the threat of having to join and having to pay dues to organized labor.","Sometimes I'm overly blunt. I don't like to mince words. I like to get things done. That's the only difference between Chris Christie and I - he's a little shy.","Am I perfect? No. Do I want to be perfect? No, because if I were perfect, I would be a reporter.","Reading newspapers in the state of Maine is like paying somebody to tell you lies."],"Paul Lieberstein":["Soon, the viewer won't even know if he's watching on broadcast or the Internet. He'll just be eating his cereal and see an image on the spoon. That's how we'll be watching soon, on spoons. The commercials will be on the knives.","When we are in pre-production, this is the best job in the world. Working 10 to 7, sitting around and brainstorming with the other writers, making things funnier and writing and rewriting scenes - that's as fun as it gets.","I feel it's very important to let individual writers' voices come through. But the character has to be consistent.","The thing about many celebrities - not all - is that they're fantastic actors. If we've created a really juicy role, it just feels like a fantastic actor should be playing the part. If it's a long enough part, we consider anyone. If it's a single episode, we don't usually let a single actor on. Because that' s just stunting.","Comedy becomes intensified in short scenes.","When someone leaves an office, often there's a series of successors until you settle on one.","The thing about many celebrities - not all - is that they're fantastic actors.","Catherine Tate was a proven comedy actress from a comedy background with great taste. I knew her work, and was an incredible fan."],"Paul Lynde":["Sandwiches are wonderful. You don't need a spoon or a plate!","A room is like a stage. If you see it without lighting, it can be the coldest place in the world.","My table seats eight, so that's my maximum. Having a small number of guests is the only way to generate good conversation. Besides, your whole house doesn't get wrecked that way.","When I said I didn't have a cent, I didn't. I used to get annoyed with people who said they were broke when they had five dollars.","Comedy is exaggerated realism. It can be stretched to the almost ludicrous, but it must always be believable.","A closet full of wire hangers can be the most dangerous place in the world.","I feel now it's useless to keep hoping. The way things are today, we live in a world that needs laughter, and I've decided if I can make people laugh, I'm making a more important contribution.","An actor shouldn't undergo psychoanalysis, because there are a lot of things you're better off not knowing.","I often go on a liquid fast a couple of days a week. I never take just water. Instead, I'll have maybe six glasses of vegetable and fruit juices a day.","If I ever completely lost my nervousness I would be frightened half to death.","I don't always prepare such rich meals. Sometimes I'll just serve a simple quiche, salad and dessert for dinner. During the week I try to eat lightly.","I was obsessed with being rich and famous.","I have this beautiful antique silver wine decanter that I bought at an auction. I always pour wine from that.","My following is straight. I'm so glad.","Someday I'm going to go onstage in a dress if I want to.","I don't know who the hell Paul Lynde is, or why he's funny, and I prefer it to be a mystery to me.","If I'm not working, I don't know what to do.","I can't even get three weeks off to have cosmetic surgery.","Food was a constant topic of conversation in our household.","The whole romantic part of my life was a wipeout. I didn't even own a belt.","My dad was a ham, too. He could sell those women anything. Of all his sons, I was the only one he could trust to sell as well as he could. I was proud of that.","I think basically an actor is a salesman.","I sang in the choir for years, even though my family belonged to another church.","My kitchen is not a place to live in. I made it white so I can tell instantly if it's not clean-and I like it clean enough to be able to eat off the floors-or the tables, for that matter.","I may find something that looks interesting and then go on to alter the recipe by adding spices, things of my own. I also look for time-saving recipes, dishes that can be prepared ahead and stored.","The dining room in my old house was truly magnificent, but by far the worst room for conversation. I'd get up from the table, a very long table, and somebody would always say, Paul, I never got to talk to you.","I have an ulcer. It has an IQ of 185.","I'm Liberace without a piano.","If I hadn't become a celebrity, I'd probably be an alcoholic.","I wish I had the nerve not to tip.","Learning lines is on my mind until I do know them. I'll read the paper or paint the house to keep from starting to memorize. I've never found an easy way.","I laughed all the way through Love Story.","Politicians... talk in generalities and lies, and I think they've caused all our grief. They're so awful, they're really funny. I hate thinking this because my dad loved politics.","It was the worst moment of my life. The producer came up and talked me back into going on stage.","I don't understand why people don't remember my name.","Mothers don't want to pinch me or put me in their purse.","My sisters said, Why do you make those faces? You make yourself so ugly.","My father was adamant in his disapproval of my interest in show business.","The doctor's name was Sylvia. I told her she'd have a problem with me because Sylvia was my mother's name."],"Paul Manafort":["I have never received a single 'off-the-books cash payment' as falsely 'reported' by 'The New York Times,' nor have I never done work for the governments of Ukraine or Russia.","Mr. Trump's position has been clear from the beginning: He's under audit. When the audit is completed, he'll release his returns.","Please, let's talk to American families and sit around the dinner table at night figuring how to pay their bills.","I'm not a lobbyist.","What happened with Brexit was people taking back control.","They get the faceless bureaucrats in Brussels and Strasbourg who have ruled and told the Brits how to live and making promises for them that their lives would get better and talking about a future based on globalism versus family and individual and local community. That's what Brexit was all about.","You can't change somebody's character, but you can change the way a person presents themselves.","We don't plan on winning in August - we plan on winning in November.","Mr. Trump of course feels sorry for what the Khan family has gone through, just, frankly, as he felt sorry for the victims that spoke before the Republican Convention who lost loved ones from illegal immigrant criminals coming in and being able to travel the country freely.","You don't change Donald Trump. You don't 'manage' him.","Many women feel they can't afford their lives; their husbands can't afford to be paying for the family bills. Hillary Clinton is guilty of being part of the establishment that created that problem.","The issue that Mr. Trump is talking about and which, really, frankly, I expect the media should be talking about is protecting the American homeland from national security risks and terrorists.","Those are the two issues: Protecting the homeland and stopping the war and going after ISIS in a way that ends the terrorism.","There are some Senate candidates who aren't sure Trump is in their interest yet, but they'll come along.","The 'Never Trump' movement was never going anywhere.","The national polls are distorted. To get a national sample, they rely too much on Hispanics from New York and California, which is where large populations are but also where most of the radical Hispanics are.","Trump was doing very well on a model that made sense, but now, as the campaign has gotten to the end stages, a more traditional campaign has to take place.","The reality is, Ted Cruz has seen his best day.","It depends on who you talk to if I'm part of the establishment or part of the antiestablishment.","I have run campaigns. That doesn't make you the establishment.","What makes you the establishment is if you buy into it.","Trump is an outsider; maybe you don't know. So he is sitting in a room: he is talking business, he is talking politics - in a private room, it's a different persona. When he's out on the stage, he is talking about the kinds of things he's talking about himself; he's projecting an image that's for that purpose.","Donald Trump was not asked by the leadership to change. And there's no reason for him to change. He's just won the primary process with a record number of votes, beating a field of 16 qualified candidates. So, there's no reason for Donald Trump to change.","You talk to tax attorneys who are not politically motivated, and they will tell you they would never advise their client to release any tax information in the course of an audit.","I have one client: Donald Trump.","As far as the Yanukovych administration is concerned, you will see, if you do any fact-checking, that I was the person that negotiated the framework which is based upon which Ukraine is now a part of Europe. That was my role. That's what I did. And when it was completed, I left.","Benghazi was a tragedy. Libya is a tragedy.","The rise of ISIS is a result of - Obama and Clinton making a decision to pull our troops out without preparing Iraq is a colossal mistake.","Leadership is failing. And Donald Trump is going to take a holistic approach to how we focus on these things, and he's not going to allow disparate activities in the communities to define everything.","The point is the country has got serious problems dealing with terrorism both domestic and international.","The conversation we should be having is, what does Russia have from Hillary Clinton's server?","Trump is very plugged in. He's very connected.","Donald Trump is talking about the failed leadership of the Obama Administration.","By the way, in Mrs. Clinton's returns, you saw a lot of income coming from donors to the Clinton Foundation and people who benefitted from her State Department term as well.","Reince Priebus is a strong supporter of Donald Trump and a good friend and supporter of Paul Ryan.","Once again, the 'New York Times' has chosen to purposefully ignore facts and professional journalism to fit their political agenda, choosing to attack my character and reputation rather than present an honest report. The suggestion that I accepted cash payments is unfounded, silly, and nonsensical.","My work in Ukraine ceased following the country's parliamentary elections in October 2014.","Trump is in the position to be the next president of the United States, given the mood in America today.","I was about 15, 16 years old when my father first ran for mayor, and that's where I cut my teeth.","Like my father, Trump also understands working-class Americans.","The role that I played in Ukraine ended up resulting in Ukraine becoming part of the European community.","We've noted that the Clinton camp was the first to get it out there, trying to say there was something untoward about the speech Melania Trump gave. It's just another example, as far as we're concerned, that when Hillary Clinton is threatened by a female, the first thing she does is try to destroy the person.","I've never dealt with the Russian government, I've never had a relationship with the Russian government.","As I've said many times, Yanukovych was a pro-Western, not pro-Putin, president.","If there's anyone who's against Wall Street, it's Donald Trump, not Hillary Clinton, who basically lives off of the funding from Wall Street.","I don't think this election is about Hillary Clinton. This election is about Donald Trump.","Pence is a fan of fundraising and does enjoy doing it.","Trump is not a fan of fundraising, but he's willing to do it.","Brexit is really a good forerunner of what's going to happen here in November, I think. The same angst that drove that vote is driving the American election.","Where there is terrorist activity - Syria or Iraq - we will temporarily suspend immigration until we can establish a vetting system in which we can identify who people are who are coming in.","Donald Trump figured out that the campaign for a moderate presidency is different than it's been in the past. He didn't put together a traditional campaign.","The Republican Party is a composition of the members of the party and not just the leadership.","Donald Trump's whole candidacy from the time he started has been filled with myths by the media that he couldn't - he was not a serious candidate.","Donald Trump understands media. He's a television star. And he's connected with America.","Donald Trump is running this campaign. And I'm working directly for Donald Trump.","We're here really to let them know that we're going to run a traditional campaign with them. And when we're the nominee of the Republican Party, you know, it's going to be a Trump brand of the party, but we are Republicans. We're running as team.","Trump's negatives are negatives that deal with his personality. People don't know yet what to make of him.","As an opinion manager, a campaign consultant, fixing personality negatives is a lot easier than fixing character negatives.","I'm always careful what clients I take.","The promises that globalism is the solution, the promise that government's going to make your life better if you just give up your freedoms, the promises that we know better than you on how to make your lives better, have been rejected.","Obviously, people feeling that their government is responsive to them is in the best interest of the United States. It's in the best interest of the U.K., it's in the best interest of countries all over the world.","Trouble follows the Clintons everywhere.","People are frustrated with all of the drama around the Clinton family and the history of the Clinton family.","Mr. Trump has said that he wants a vice president who knows Washington, is able to deal with the Congress, and could be viewed as somebody who could be president.","I work directly for the boss. I listen to everybody, but I have one man whose voice is louder than everybody else's.","The point is - that Donald Trump has been making on the campaign trail is that he's financing his own campaign. That's very important for him to say now in his mind because he wants people to know that he owes nobody anything other than the American people, or the voters who are picking, choosing his candidacy.","When it comes to the general election, we are no longer running as an individual: we are running as the head of a ticket. And so the party itself will be doing some things to raise money, and Mr. Trump has indicated that he'd be willing to help the party.","The framework of the election favors Donald Trump.","If we run the campaign that we plan on running, we think we're going to win.","The simplest answer is the truth: I am a campaign professional.","Securing the Republican nomination is an intricate series of steps that requires a comprehensive strategy.","Of course he's going to work with Paul Ryan; of course he's tried to bridge the party together with Paul Ryan, but Ryan is also running against somebody who's not going to win but nonetheless is a strong supporter of Mr. Trump's.","We are organized, we are moving forward, and the Clinton machine may not like it, but we're prepared for the fight.","As I'm telling people today, 'Never Trump' is nevermore. I mean, they're just gone."],"Paul Marciano":["At the beginning, we didn't have the money to pay big names, which is how looking for new faces began a tradition that still continues 30 years into the Guess history. It's been interesting to follow their careers after a Guess shoot, for both photographers and models, because the exposure around the world becomes so huge.","Guess will always be loyal and true to its roots.","The Guess girl always combines sensuality with class. She's sexy and voluptuous, but not in a vulgar or cheesy way. Over the years, whether it was when I first saw Laetitia Casta, Eva Herzigova, or Anna Nicole Smith, the common thread when choosing the next Guess girl was an instant feeling in my stomach that she was the one.","When models started getting skinnier in the nineties and were becoming sick-looking, I didn't get it! I think that's sending a totally wrong message.","When images are in black and white, they seem timeless. When you see Carrie Otis in an ad from 1989 next to an ad with Klara Wester from 2009, you don't see a 20-year difference between the pictures.","We had just recently moved to California from Italy, and while we were driving around, we saw a billboard ad for McDonald's on Olympic Boulevard in Los Angeles. The word 'guess' was in the ad, and my brother decided that that would be the name of our company!","Since the day we started Guess, the brand has always stood for young, sexy and adventurous, and it is these same qualities that I look for in the models that become Guess Girls. They also have to look healthy.","When the waif look first came into fashion, Anna Nicole Smith was in the Guess campaigns looking like a real woman. A girl who looks too thin and unhealthy does not look sexy to me, and she does not look right for Guess.","I wish I could say that Carla Bruni's Guess campaign at age 16 led to her current role as First Lady of France, but that might be a stretch.","Drew Barrymore's Guess shoot took place as she was making the transition to serious actress after having been more known as a child actress who had become overwhelmed by the Hollywood lifestyle.","The campaigns and the models in them create the fantasy around the brand. It has always been about having strong images. Without that, we could not have gone into all the categories we did. It really has been the foundation from where the house of Guess was built.","I strongly believe that the heritage of Guess is rooted in denim, and the Guess girl looks to us for iconic and sexy styles."],"Paul Martin":["The people of Canada have worked hard to build a country that opens its doors to include all, regardless of their differences; a country that respects all, regardless of their differences; a country that demands equality for all, regardless of their differences.","In Canada, women's rights are a vital part of our effort to build a society of real equality - not just for some, but for all Canadians. A society in which women no longer encounter discrimination nor are shut out from opportunities open to others.","Have you ever, on a cloudless night, looked down from a passing aircraft flying over Canada? Endless, glowing strings of cities, towns, and homesteads. Stretching on and on, one province to the next. With only the stars in the distance.","As a people, we know what we can do, we know how to do it, and we just want to get on with it. How? By ensuring that Canada's place in the world is one of influence and pride.","At a moment that comes rarely in the life of a country. It is a time when destiny is ours to hold.","Every Canadian who wants to learn should have the opportunity to do so.","I really think Canada should get over to Iraq as quickly as possible.","I rise in support of a Canada in which liberties are safeguarded, rights are protected and the people of this land are treated as equals under the law.","If we do not step forward, then we step back. If we do not protect a right, then we deny it.","The achievements we forge in this place and in our nation will not be those of one person or one party.","The vicious circle has been shattered. Canadians now enjoy the benefits of the virtuous circle.","For years governments have been promising more than they can deliver, and delivering more than they can afford.","I rise today in support of Bill C-38, the Civil Marriage Act. I rise in support of a Canada in which liberties are safeguarded, rights are protected and the people of this land are treated as equals under the law.","The facts are plain: Religious leaders who preside over marriage ceremonies must and will be guided by what they believe. If they do not wish to celebrate marriages for same-sex couples, that is their right. The Supreme Court says so. And the Charter says so."],"Paul Mazursky":["The one thing that's closest to my story is the thing about trying out for the juvenile delinquent role and getting it. That was the start of my acting career... which I've resumed, by the way.","California is an island, and New York's an island. Maybe it's time for me to change islands.","Even when I begin with a situation that's basically funny or sad, I like to keep poking around in it. I like to get into the middle of a relationship, to explore the subtle places.","I don't like movies that are morally simple.","I wish in my own mind I were more definite - that I was absolutely convinced I'd never direct someone else's script, but I keep reading scripts, because I might find something.","I wonder if that's hurt me at the box office. Maybe audiences these days want to know exactly what to expect when they go into a movie, and my movies are hard to explain in just one way.","One thing I know is that I don't want to be a director for hire, making genre films."],"Paul McCartney":["If slaughterhouses had glass walls, everyone would be a vegetarian.","None of us wanted to be the bass player. In our minds he was the fat guy who always played at the back.","One of my biggest thrills for me still is sitting down with a guitar or a piano and just out of nowhere trying to make a song happen.","We were a savage little lot, Liverpool kids, not pacifist or vegetarian or anything. But I feel I've gone beyond that, and that it was immature to be so prejudiced and believe in all the stereotypes.","I don't work at being ordinary.","It's time to end the cruel slaughter of whales and leave these magnificent creatures alone.","When I sit down to write a song, it's a kind of improvisation, but I formalize it a bit to get it into the studio, and when I step up to a microphone, I have a vague idea of what I'm about to do.","I look a lot busier than I am, as I'm actually a rather sporadic, random person and I'll play a few gigs and then disappear for a while.","I have not practiced how to be a singer without an instrument.","I had this song called Helter Skelter, which is just a ridiculous song. So we did it like that, 'cuz I like noise.","In the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.","Somebody said to me, 'But the Beatles were anti-materialistic.' That's a huge myth. John and I literally used to sit down and say, 'Now, let's write a swimming pool.'","Think globally, act locally.","Why would I retire? Sit at home and watch TV? No thanks. I'd rather be out playing.","I used to think that anyone doing anything weird was weird. I suddenly realized that anyone doing anything weird wasn't weird at all and it was the people saying they were weird that were weird.","I've got to admit it's getting better. It's a little better all the time.","There are only four people who knew what the Beatles were about anyway.","We were pretty good mates until the Beatles started to split up and Yoko came into it. It was more like old army buddies splitting up on account of wedding bells.","With the Beatles, we'd been very spoiled because we had George Martin who worked for the record label we were going to be signed to. That was very fortunate, because we grew together.","The rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated.","When we were starting off as kids, just the idea of maybe going to do this as a living instead of getting what we thought was going to be a boring job, was exciting.","I hate the idea of success robbing you of your private life.","I used to think that all my Wings stuff was second-rate stuff, but I began to meet younger kids, not kids from my Beatle generation, who would say, We really love this song.","I don't take me seriously. If we get some giggles, I don't mind.","But with writers, there's nothing wrong with melancholy. It's an important color in writing.","Microphones are just like people, if you shout at them, they get scared.","I never look forward, because I have no idea about how any of it happened to getting here. I've no idea how the next five years are going to be.","I used to think anyone doing anything weird was weird. Now I know that it is the people that call others weird that are weird.","Love is all you need.","It's also not unusual for writers to look backward. Because that's your pool of resources.","I'm the worst on facts about me or facts about the Beatles.","I feel that if I said anything about John, I would have to sit here for five days and say it all. Or I don't want to say anything.","If children are studying the 20th century, I'm in their text books.","I'm a pretty hands-on dad and make the most of my custody. I take care of my little one whenever I can, and she determines what I can do and where I can do it.","I'm not religious, but I'm very spiritual.","I'm often reading a magazine and hearing about someone's new record, and I think, 'Oh, boy, that's gonna be better than me.' It's a very common thing.","Somewhere down the line everyone must pay for their misdeeds.","Being in the audience actually looks like quite a lot of fun.","Putting two songs together, I've always loved that trick when it works.","Nothing pleases me more than to go into a room and come out with a piece of music.","I definitely did look up to John. We all looked up to John. He was older and he was very much the leader; he was the quickest wit and the smartest.","Where I come from, you don't really talk about how much you're earning. Those things are private. My dad never told my mum how much he was earning. I'm certainly not going to tell the world. I'm doing well.","Someone like John would want to end the Beatle period and start the Yoko period. He wouldn't like either to interfere with the other.","John's time and effort were, in the main, spent on pretty honorable stuff. As for the other side, well, nobody's perfect, nobody's Jesus. And look what they did to him.","I saw that Meryl Streep said, I just want to do my job well. And really, that's all I'm ever trying to do.","I knew the words to 25 rock songs, so I got in the group. Long Tall Sally and Tutti-Frutti, that got me in. That was my audition.","I can take pot or leave it. I got busted in Japan for it. I was nine days without it and there wasn't a hint of withdrawal, nothing.","George wrote Taxman, and I played guitar on it. He wrote it in anger at finding out what the taxman did. He had never known before then what could happen to your money.","At the end of the Beatles, I really was done in for the first time in my life. Until then, I really was a kind of cocky sod.","Buy, buy, says the sign in the shop window; Why, why, says the junk in the yard.","It was Elvis who really got me hooked on beat music. When I heard 'Heartbreak Hotel' I thought, this is it.","My dad was a particularly polite kind of guy, very courteous.","She is the rock 'n' roll queen. Weirdly enough, that is one of the things her reign will be remembered for. Queen Elizabeth I, we remember Raleigh; Queen Elizabeth II it's gonna be the Beatles.","Look, people are allowed their own opinions and they don't always coincide with yours. As an artist you just have to keep plugging on.","I was still 15 when I met John Lennon at a village fete in Woolton, in Liverpool.","My dad, bless him, was a musician. And his dad had thought that his music was rubbish.","Looking back, I think I was always musical. My dad was very musical, and I think my mom was musical.","I think I always had a musicality, and I think I could tell a good song from a bad song. And I would appreciate hearing something that was new to me.","I think the pop industry is still a young man's game.","The Stones also still have a huge following. Mick Jagger leaps around like a crazy dude. And Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood and Charlie Watts are playing great too.","My so-called career is a haphazard thing.","When you first get money, you buy all these things so no one thinks you're mean, and you spread it around. You get a chauffeur and you find yourself thrown around the back of this car and you think, I was happier when I had my own little car! I could drive myself!","To keep the record straight, it wasn't always John and Yoko. We've all accused one another of various business things; we tend to be pretty paranoid by now, as you can imagine. There's a lot of money involved.","Lyricists play with words.","I think people who create and write, it actually does flow-just flows from into their head, into their hand, and they write it down. It's simple.","I never really got on that well with Yoko anyway. Strangely enough, I only started to get to know her after John's death.","I don't ever try to make a serious social comment.","I can't deal with the press; I hate all those Beatles questions.","George Martin, he's very good at a very sort of lush, sweet arrangement.","So, if I'm cooking, I'll be steaming vegetables, making some nice salad, that kind of stuff.","But you know, as a kid I would have thought of a vegetarian as a wimp.","My old school in Liverpool is now a performing-arts school, and I kind of teach there - I use the word lightly - but I go there and talk to students.","I got my first guitar when I was 15, and I just used to fool about with it, more or less, as time went by, though, I got more interested.","You see, my mother was a district nurse until she died when I was 14, and we used to move from time to time because of her work.","And I loved Fats Waller. I love his instrumental abilities, his vocal abilities and his sense of humor.","I like the idea that people hear my stuff, and if it's commercially successful, that's a good sign that it's being heard.","I love the past. There are parts of the past I hate, of course.","I'm always writing songs, and I've got a bunch that I want to record."],"Paul McDonald":["If my life were a song, what would it be? 'A Never Ending Road of Musical Good Times'.","They said just keep doing my thing, don't try to change anything, which I won't.","I've been touring for so long, I've kind of honed into exactly what I am, I'm an artist so if you like it, you like it, if you don't you don't, you know?","I don't want to be the cliche American Idol dude. I want to be different, you know - that's the whole goal, me and music. It's about being yourself and being unique.","My favorite music to sing would be my own songs, my original songs, just because I know them, you know I write the tunes, so my favorite songs are the newest ones that I write. That's what I like to sing the most, because it means something, it's real, it comes from me.","I sing both in my shower and in my car, mostly in my car, because I have this weird thing - whenever I'm singing to the radio - my friends kind of hate it - but I pick out the harmonies in my head, and I'm singing the harmonies to the tracks and I'm jamming it out."],"Paul McEuen":["Nanotechnology is the idea that we can create devices and machines all the way down to the nanometer scale, which is a billionth of a meter, about half the width of a human DNA molecule.","It's amazing that something only an atom thick can be an impenetrable barrier. You can have gas on one side and vacuum or liquid on the other, and with a wall only one atom thick, nothing would go through it.","The lessons learned as we try to build ever more sophisticated nanomachines will almost certainly inform our understanding of the origins of life.","I remember being fascinated by ants and wasps and other bugs when I was a kid. I'd set out a Coke can and stand back 20 feet and use my telescope to watch wasps land on it.","As an undergrad, I studied engineering physics at the University of Oklahoma, and all my degrees are from engineering departments. My father wanted me to join him in the oil-field business in Oklahoma, but I wanted to be a scientist.","Carbon nanotubes are amazing because they're really good electrical conductors, yet they are only a few atoms in diameter. You can make transistors out of them in the same way you can with silicon. At Berkeley, we made the narrowest device anybody had ever made. It was basically a single molecule."],"Paul McGann":["Films are artifice. We're telling stories on film. At the same time, when it works, there is a real tough immediacy and spontaneity to it, and a punch.","Brighton gives me the heebie-jeebies. When I'm near the seafront I can't sleep, I can't eat.","Coming from a large family makes you feel protected - you have friends and allies.","Careers are what they are, they don't make any sense at all when you look back. We're not in charge of them.","I'm not a sci-fi lover; I wasn't from the start. So perhaps I miss that passion for other worlds, other dimensions, that sort of scope and that magnitude of storytelling; that's not my thing though I meet plenty of people whose thing it definitely is.","I don't have a television. No. So, I don't watch anything.","I think you can make perfectly good television just from people who are genuinely interested, talking to people who genuinely know - simple as it sounds, it can be riveting.","I never thought I'd be one of those old hams who favours theatre over everything, but I'm getting that way. Telly and film seemed more fun when I was younger; turning left on planes and washing up in nice places. But there are things that you only learn in theatre.","The power of telly is surprising. If you're in a six-part series, you're famous while it's on - people point in the street. Two weeks later it all goes back to normal.","If you're in the so-called public eye you have to watch your P's and Q's.","As an actor, you get hired to repeat yourself. It wears you out.","I admire artists who are ageing and still retaining their edge.","I resent almost all of the time I spend in front of the television, but I find 'The Only Way Is Essex' absolutely riveting."],"Paul Mellon":["There is no intellectual or emotional substitute for the authentic, the original, the unique masterpiece.","Preliminary drawings or sketches in oil or pastel often have an immediacy and emotional appeal far greater than the final canvas.","Within 18 months of my parents' marriage in 1900, my mother fell in love with an Englishman who would have described himself as a gentleman but who was, in fact, nothing more than a devious adventurer.","Collecting is the sort of thing that creeps up on you.","Just as there is no substitute for original works of art, there is no substitute for the world of direct sensual experience.","When you give away large sums of money, you can cause as much damage as you may do good.","College isn't the only answer. Reading is a college that you can and should attend all your life.","In a way, my father was lucky. He had a hunch that his vision of the National Gallery would interest other collectors and persuade them to come in with him, and that hunch proved to be right.","It was my father's hope, and it is ours, that the National Gallery would become not a static but a living institution, growing in usefulness and importance to artists, scholars and the general public."],"Paul Merton":["My school days were the happiest days of my life; which should give you some indication of the misery I've endured over the past twenty-five years.","When I wake up on a Monday morning and I realise I don't have to go and work at the civil service, I really think I've won.","In a psychiatric hospital, a lot of people believe that people on TV are talking to them directly through the screen. I'm with about 500 of these people, and I'm on TV every Friday night. As I was queuing up for breakfast one morning, one guy nearly jumped out of his skin. My first thought was to go 'Woooo!'","The thing about improvisation is that it's not about what you say. It's listening to what other people say. It's about what you hear.","And like the old stereotype, I overcame my shyness by making my friends laugh.","On my first day in New York a guy asked me if I knew where Central Park was. When I told him I didn't he said, 'Do you mind if I mug you here?'.","I read every book about Buster Keaton and Chaplin to see how they worked - it's all about dedication, tunnel vision, pursuit of perfection, getting the gag right.","Well, sanity, I suppose, is getting people to see the world your way.","I've never been disappointed by politicians. I've never invested that much in them in the first place.","It was a bizarre existence I led in my early twenties - that cliche of the comedian who goes out and entertains a roomful of people and then goes home to a lonely bedsit was unbelievably poignant for me because that was exactly what I was doing. I had periods of real loneliness.","It seems like a contradiction, but the shy person who is a performer actually does make sense, because in a way, when you're young and shy, making people laugh is a good way to make friends. It's an instant connection.","When I turned about 12 or 13, I realised that being funny wasn't about remembering jokes. It was about creating them.","I'm always amazed to hear of air crash victims so badly mutilated that they have to be identified by their dental records. What I can't understand is, if they don't know who you are, how do they know who your dentist is?","Am I allowed to call myself working-class now? Because obviously I'm now very rich.","I remember being fascinated by the very nature of comedy from the age of 10; why is this funny, and that isn't?","I looked at longevity in show business when I was about 13, and the people who seemed to have longevity were the ones who'd spent quite a bit of time learning about what they were doing before they made it.","I really don't take any interest at all in contemporary comedy.","I don't always vote in general elections, but I think I've always voted Labour.","I think having an outsider's viewpoint is interesting and good, especially for a comedian.","When I was nine I spent a lot of my time reading books about the history of comedy, or listening to the Goons or Hancock, humour from previous generations.","In fact, I don't watch a lot of contemporary comedy for fear of being influenced by it.","I was trying to organise my DVDs into a sort of chronological order, and I am afraid that it all trailed off after the Sixties.","All disc jockeys are without talent. Noel Edmonds - I can't stand Noel Edmonds.","In 1986, I was attacked in the street as I helped Neil Mullarkey from the Comedy Store Players to put up posters. We were in the wrong place at the wrong time - midnight - and we were English. I got kicked in the head.","Beginning with a trip out to Ellis Island, I saw for myself where thousands of European immigrants took their first steps onto American soil, bringing with them nothing but their ambition: people such as Erich von Stroheim and Adolph Zukor.","In 1987, I was in Edinburgh doing my first one-man show. I took part in a kickabout with some fellow comedians and tripped over my trousers and heard this cracking sound in my leg. A couple of days later I went into a coma and was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism.","Maybe there's a perception of me as grumpy old bugger who suffers from depression. It's a total misconception. I don't think of myself as any grumpier than the next person. I'm not even grumpy first thing in the morning.","Generally speaking, politicians are an odd bunch. They seem to have very thick skins and genuinely don't care what people think. And charm is a very important part of the politician's armoury. I try to resist that kind of charm.","At one point in the mid-Eighties I shared a promoter with the Smiths. One night, we were sitting backstage when Morrissey burst in, utterly distraught, sobbing his heart out. Turns out someone had thrown a sausage at him on stage during 'Meat Is Murder.'","When I used to do the Edinburgh Festival, there was a bunch of guys selling fresh oysters and I'd eat ten daily - marvellous.","I'll never forget my first experience of swede. It was at school and I thought I was getting mashed potato. I've never got over it.","I was flying to the Maldives in 2000 when the plane went through turbulence - after that, I didn't fly for four years. Then a job came up in India, so I did a simulator flight and learnt about what goes on in the cockpit. I'm fine now.","If you became a comedian in the '80s, you had to work the circuit and make people laugh. Canned laughter is cheating.","I was never one to go up to someone as a five- or six-year-old and say, 'Hello, my name's Paul, will you be my friend?' But I found if I did an impression of the PE teacher or whatever and people laughed, then they did like me, and so then they started talking to me, rather than me making the initial overture and then maybe being rebuffed.","There's something magical about film, it's the ultimate for me, because it's kind of permanent - inasmuch as anything is. When I went to see Buster Keaton when I was about 14 and I came out of the cinema having really laughed at this film which had been made 50 years before, I thought: That's immortality. It's fantastic.","I have never sold my story, done 'Hello!' magazine, any of that stuff. I'm not guilty of exploiting my private life for cash and then saying, 'Oh, I don't want to talk about my private life.' I've never crossed that line.","When things are difficult, awful, stressful, the thing that always gets you through is a sense of humour. I don't mean - well, maybe I do - laugh at the hangman as he puts the noose around your neck. But an eye, an ear, for the ridiculous, the absurd in life, can get you through a lot.","The economics favour one-man comedy shows: all you need is one person, a microphone and a PA system. But I'm pleased so many people are making a living out of comedy - it's a wonderful business to be in.","I never give anyone advice: it can backfire horribly. In the 1950s, Eric Morecambe told Ken Dodd to get his teeth fixed. But those teeth turned out to be one of Dodd's big selling points."],"Paul Michael Glaser":["We all know that looking back only gets you into an accident because you're going to run into something without seeing it.","We were surprised that the television series had the kind of longevity that it had after only four years of filming it and the reception in 6 countries around the world was quite extraordinary.","So being present becomes more and more the exercise the older you get.","I was surprised that the TV series was popular itself, but after that it went on to become more popular over the years and thus it seemed eventually that they would turn it into a movie.","Secondly, I thought it was ridiculous to have two undercover policemen driving around in a striped tomato.","This particular film highlights Ben and Owen's strengths which is that they are great comedic actors with tremendous chemistry and they do a really good job.","The car is a character in the piece - I've never liked the car, I submitted to it's objectionable popularity.","So it eventually became a question of WHEN they were going to make a movie.","No, the seventies was a totally different sensibility and that allowed us to break new ground as a cop show.","I've been writing a lot, I've a few projects I'm trying to finance, I do some acting, I do some directing... Apart from that, if I could get lower that a ten handicap on my golf game I'd be thrilled.","I don't think a movie today that captured all the things that we did in the seventies could come close, because it's like asking to recreate the seventies and the audience sensibilities and that's impossible.","First of all I thought it was ugly, I thought it was ridiculous that undercover police guys would drive a striped tomato and I've never been a big champion of Ford."],"Paul Mooney":["An audience can be like a pack of wolves.","People ask me, when was my best time? I always say, 'Today.'","I have such an ego 'cause I'm a double Leo. I can't let go of me, you know, so it's very difficult for me to be somebody else and not me. I'm so into me.","You know who you are. If my mother is a nun and someone comes up to me and they go, 'Your mother is a prostitute.' It is not going to bother me, because I know my mother is a nun, she's not a prostitute.","I've never seen anyone more messed up over success than Richard Pryor. For him, it's a constant battle between success in the white world and keeping it real for his black self.","People don't want to hear the truth; they never do. They wanna live in some kind of fantasy.","I'm passionate about what I do. I'd be naive to be passive.","When you know who you are, you know who you are. That's the real dangerous thing in Hollywood, because they all want to create you and mold you.","There's no such thing as reverse racism.","What does America love more than one white male?","Julie Christie, I used to hang out with her. She was friends with Richard Pryor and Warren Beatty and all of them. There was a club in Beverly Hills called the Candy Store, a private club. I used to hang out with them all.","When they were making black films in the '60s and the '70s, everyone knew their place, if you get my drift. You understand? Everyone knew the rules, and everyone knew their place. Everyone knew what to say. They had the written rules in Hollywood film, and the unwritten rules.","America is racial. America was founded on race. Race is America. The code name for America is 'race.'","We have a lot of black Anglo-Saxons. Their skin is black, but their brain is white. When I get real mad at them, I call them 'graham crackers.'","White people are very good at acting like they're not racist. They deserve an Academy Award for that.","I have nothing to do with racism in America; it was here when I got here.","People think you're crazy if you turn money down... people worship money.","The king of comedy is dead. Richard Pryor was the king of comedy. The rest of them are the king of copycats.","If you're happy with what you're doing, then you don't get bored.","If you have money and you have fame, but you don't have any confidence in your blackness, then it's all for nothing.","A woman can tell me about her having a baby, but I'll never know what it is to have a baby.","I'm like the Davy Crockett of comedy... after Davy Crockett opened up the West and helped everybody... they didn't need him anymore. I freed a lot of comics... if I never would have done comedy, it would've been a different art form... I'm sure of it.","I read a lot of history. The passive Jews in Germany didn't survive. The smart ones got out.","What does it mean to be too black for Hollywood? It's self-explanatory. Hollywood has certain kinds of blacks that they like.","Hillary Clinton could say she was a woman and running for president. And Sarah Palin could say she was a woman and running for vice-president. But Obama couldn't say, 'I'm black and I'm running for president.' It couldn't come out of his mouth. He couldn't say that because, if he did, he'd lose votes.","I like when people are trapped in the joke, when there's no escape. I like to lead people down the wrong path and then trap them.","Whatever that thing is that white people like in blacks, I don't have it. Maybe it's my arrogance or my self-assurance or the way I carry myself, but whatever it is, I don't have it.","I could drop dead tomorrow, the truth will be here. Truth is forever; when you read our history, truth is forever, and it always outs itself.","I'm as American as apple pie.","America has a rap sheet. You can't police the world and tell the world how to act when you're just as bad yourself.","Robin Williams learned technique. He has the technique of being funny.","I was born a comic.","I think about never losing my voice, never giving in, never selling out, always keeping black, always sticking to the street. Staying neighborhood and not Hollywood.","You white folks see UFOs in your dreams. You don't hear about Martians in Harlem.","There are still plenty of movie people peddling black stereotypes. I guess Tyler Perry's probably the most massively successful.","My comedy is a nuclear bomb inside my mind. It's a weapon that's never been tested. It just blows up and flattens everybody.","I love Obama because he is proof all black people don't look alike. Nobody every told me, 'Good morning, Mr. President.' We don't all look alike.","There's always a message in my comedy.","My grandmother was the best. She loved you for you. She loved me for me. She was old-school. They broke the mold with her. They don't make them like that any more.","Handshaking means, 'I don't have a weapon.'","Hollywood doesn't even have respect for itself. Hollywood lies to itself.","If your hair is relaxed, white people are relaxed. If your hair is nappy, they're not happy.","When I was 16 or 17, I saw Lenny Bruce being taken to jail. They took him off stage because he talked about race.","I think I have a mental nappy attitude.","I do celebrate anything with freedom in it, you know.","You got to remember that slavery's very complex. It has a lot of levels to it.","I don't want affirmative action - too much affirmative, not enough action.","Comedians period, in general, have demons, and myself included.","I am very concerned about Barbara Streisand using the 'H' word - 'honkey.' That's what I am concerned about. I am worried about Barbara.","Listen, we've got one little ol' black president, and white folks are upset, but they've had 43.","I have known Michael Richards for something like 20 years. We're friends.","I can't change the past, but one person can change the future - anything can happen.","Sometimes, what you do you have no control over because it's predestined. It's gonna happen in spite of you. There's nothing you can do about it.","I like comedy, I mean, in all forms.","I got my sense of humor from my grandmother. You know, my grandmother was very funny.","Arizona has always been anti-black.","Tennessee Williams knew about the South, but he would clean it up and lie about it.","When you watch TV, I didn't know black people were that happy. I had no idea they were that happy. I'm trying to find them."],"Paul Morand":["Mirrors are ice which do not melt: what melts are those who admire themselves in them.","Speed kills colour... the gyroscope, when turning at full speed, shows up gray."],"Paul Muldoon":["I suppose for whatever reason I actively welcome being put down, something which perhaps goes back to my upbringing - that accusation of not being worthy which could be laid at one's door.","I certainly am interested in accessibility, clarity, and immediacy.","One will never again look at a birch tree, after the Robert Frost poem, in exactly the same way.","I think poetry, rather than suffering, is more and more sufficient to the needs of our society. It's one of the reasons so much of it is, for want of a better term, 'surreal.'","I believe that these devices like repetition and rhyme are not artificial, that they're not imposed, somehow, on the language.","One is constantly trying to figure out what came together in one's childhood. Lots of people spend significant portions of their lives in therapy - especially in the States - trying to work out who they are. I'm certain there is a little of that in the business of writing. That would explain why certain images and themes recur.","For whatever reason, people, including very well-educated people or people otherwise interested in reading, do not read poetry.","Frost isn't exactly despised but not enough people have worked out what a brilliant poet he was.","I do a lot of readings.","I live in New Jersey now, which always gets a bad rap here and there, but I must say, I enjoy living here too.","I was born in Northern Ireland in 1951. I lived most of my life there until 1986 or 1987.","I'm sure 50 percent of television ads use rhyme.","It seems to me the structure of the Quartets is too imposed.","Living at that pitch, on that edge, is something which many poets engage in to some extent.","Obviously one of the things that poets from Northern Ireland and beyond - had to try to make sense of was what was happening on a day-to-day political level.","Of course, you can't legislate for how people are going to read.","On the other hand, at some level the mass of unresolved issues in Northern Ireland does influence the fact that there are so many good writers in the place.","That's one of the great things about poetry; one realises that one does one's little turn - that you're just part of the great crop, as it were.","The ground swell is what's going to sink you as well as being what buoys you up. These are cliches also, of course, and I'm sometimes interested in how much one can get away with.","The other side of it is that, despite all that, people reach out to poetry at the key moments in their lives.","We simply have not kept in touch with poetry.","What I try to do is to go into a poem - and one writes them, of course, poem by poem - to go into each poem, first of all without having any sense whatsoever of where it's going to end up.","Words want to find chimes with each other, things want to connect.","Your average pop song or film is a very sophisticated item, with very sophisticated ways of listening and viewing that we have not really consciously developed over the years - because we were having such a good time.","At high school, instead of the weekly essay, I would write a poem, and the teacher accepted that. The impulse was one of laziness, I'm certain. Poems were shorter than essays.","I read a lot of nineteenth-century French poetry. And Irish poetry from the ninth century on.","I met Seamus Heaney and Michael Longley on the same day in 1968. I was sixteen at the time. Very exciting. They were reading at Armagh. One of my teachers brought me to meet them, introduced me, and I became friends with them.","Believe it or not, one of the first poets I was aware of was Yeats. I recited 'The Lake Isle of Innisfree' at a verse speaking competition when I was eight or nine.","I spent about five years stuck in a room between the ages of 16 and 20 while I wrote the first book, which came out when I was 21. I should have been out playing tennis.","Teaching regularly has made me an even more adept reader, I think. The kind of teaching I do is more like editing than anything else. The kind of editing book editors used to do before lunch. The kind of editing I used to do as a radio documentary maker.","Poetry is as vital as ever. The teaching of poetry reading, however, is sluggish and, often, slovenly. It needs to be expanded in the school curriculum and be more a feature of society at large. The newspapers should all be carrying a daily poem. It should be as natural as reading a novel.","I don't shape trends, I'd say. I merely reflect them. I think the emphasis is on 'them.' I like variety in poetry. I love how it comes in so many guises. As rock lyric, as rap, as note on a fridge.","The best poems come from the world, go through the poet, and go back in to the world.","I love adventure stories.","I was reared on American TV and films. There was a huge sense of occasion about going to the cinema in Moy in the late 1950s and early '60s, and I absolutely loved those Hollywood sword-and-sandal movies like Ben-Hur and the dime-a-dozen cowboy-and-Indian films, as we then referred to them.","The best thing anybody has ever done is to advise me against publishing a poem that shows me at less than my best, such as it is. That's the kind of advice most of us resist but really should relish.","I love the fact that Inuit poetry may resonate with me as much as Irish.","I do believe that we've a responsibility to try to acknowledge the range, both geographic and graphic, of what's happening in poetry in English. I'm interested in poems that are first-rate. After that, I'm not too concerned if they come from Queens or Queensland."],"Paul Muni":["I don't want to be a star. If you have to label me anything, I'm an actor - I guess. A journeyman actor. I think 'star' is what you call actors who can't act.","A writer can write in an attic, or on top of a bus. Or with a sharp stick in some wet cement. To act, an actor has to have words. A stage. a camera turning.","I've never tried to learn the art of acting. I have been in the business for years but I still can't tell what acting is or how it's done.","I'm about as Chinese as Herbert Hoover.","Nature's far too subtle to repeat herself.","I won't go up in a plane, but if a play crashes, I'll jump into the next one that comes along and take it up for a spin."],"Paul Nehlen":["We do not need an immigration policy that displaces American workers or American students and drives up costs in education.","The question is, why do we have Muslims in the country?","Paul Ryan is the mercenary champion of Hillary Clinton's - this is Hillary Clinton's. This came out of the State Department. This Trans Pacific Partnership is going to export our jobs. It's going to import foreign workers to replace Americans and our jobs.","We need an immigration policy that works for America First.","Can you name the last time Paul Ryan worked as hard for Wisconsin workers as he has for corporate America? I can't. I can't think of one time.","Paul Ryan's in for Paul Ryan.","Paul Ryan was grown in a petri dish in D.C. He is absolutely an open borders guy, through and through.","If someone is supporting Sharia, that is doing something wrong.","Mr. Trump is unifying the party, and I applaud him for that.","I'm so grateful to Ms. Palin and all the people who've endorsed me.","I'm calling out the enemy. He is Speaker Paul Ryan.","The jobs aren't going away. They're bringing in people to replace Americans in those jobs. And this Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership, it makes it worse.","We have got to secure the border and enforce existing immigration laws.","We could secure the border in 72 hours. We could. We just don't have the political will in Washington.","I'm supporting Donald Trump because Donald Trump is against this trade deal, this Trans Pacific Partnership, this job-killing trade deal that is going to bring cheap labor into this country.","My message hasn't changed from day one.","Paul Ryan whipped the votes to get fast track Trade Promotion Authority to sell our jobs to foreign countries. He absolutely worked on that. Paul Ryan owns it. He can't say he doesn't agree with it, because when he did that, that contract was already written. It was already set up - that treaty was already set up.","Paul Ryan has shown more passion in attacking Trump than he has ever shown in defending Americans.","Donald Trump has courageously taken on the entrenched special interests who sought to suppress the working people of this country and who have sought to deny them a livable wage.","I'm a businessman. I build things, create jobs - jobs that allow people to pay their mortgage, put food on the table, put their kids through college.","TPP is a job killer.","Here's what we should be doing. We should be monitoring every mosque. We should be monitoring social media. We've got about three million Muslims in the United States.","Islam is not a religion. It's a political system. It has a different set of rules.","If Americans want President Trump to be successful, we must retire Speaker Ryan.","If Paul Ryan is re-elected, if he's sent back to Congress, he will push for the biggest amnesty in this country's history; and immediately after his re-election, he will push Obama's jailbreak crime agenda.","If the Muslim is Sharia-compliant, that is in direct conflict with the U.S. Constitution.","Here's the thing you got to remember: I don't believe that the breakpoint is terrorism. I believe... the breakpoint is Sharia.","I run businesses all around the United States, all around the globe.","I've closed factories in Mexico and brought those jobs back to the United States. I've closed factories in Canada and brought those jobs back to the United States.","Paul Ryan has been part of the Never-Trump group.","Paul Ryan is the establishment tool in D.C. that tries to splinter groups and does not work for the will of the people.","As recently as 2014, I was a Paul Ryan supporter. I pounded signs and made phone calls on his behalf. I bought his book and gave it out to friends.","If you're a representative, you listen to your constituents, and then you go vote their conscience. You don't go vote your special interest buddies' interest and then come back and justify it.","We are absolutely going to make sure Paul Ryan is being held accountable to the people.","I took on the leader of the globalist agenda, the leader of the Republican Party, the Koch brothers.","Even Democrats were donating to me.","Immigration and border security are two separate issues, but Paul Ryan has taken the wrong side on both of those, in fact.","Who is going to take business advice from Paul Ryan? Who? Nobody. Nobody.","We need trade for good jobs in Wisconsin.","Paul Ryan says he's for smaller government, and he's funded every big government idea that there is.","Not only has Paul Ryan not died on any hill for a position he believes in to make government smaller, he hasn't even skinned his knee."],"Paul Neilan":["I hate bananas. I just hate them. But I also think a banana suit is the funniest fruit costume a person can wear.","Anybody can make something up and have it sound believable. The hard part is remembering all the lies you've told, and all the people you've told them to, and then living the lies that have become your life."],"Paul Newman":["There are places you go, and they say, 'Take off your dark glasses so we can see your beautiful blue eyes.' And you just want to... you just want to... I dunno, um... thump them.","Who's to say who's an expert?","If you're playing a poker game and you look around the table and and can't tell who the sucker is, it's you.","Newman's first law: It is useless to put on your brakes when you're upside down.","Newman's second law: Just when things look darkest, they go black.","If you don't have enemies, you don't have character.","You can't be as old as I am without waking up with a surprised look on your face every morning: 'Holy Christ, whaddya know - I'm still around!' It's absolutely amazing that I survived all the booze and smoking and the cars and the career.","People stay married because they want to, not because the doors are locked.","Every time I get a script it's a matter of trying to know what I could do with it. I see colors, imagery. It has to have a smell. It's like falling in love. You can't give a reason why.","The Sixties - I had to have my foot in everything then. I'm doing the same thing now but through an intermediary. You know. The food company. Maybe that's the way to go about it. You go right straight into the inferno, and when you get older, you pull back.","The star of oil and vinegar and the oil and vinegar of the stars.","Show me a good loser and I will show you a loser.","Money won is twice as sweet as money earned.","To be an actor you have to be a child.","You only grow when you are alone.","So you wound up with Apollo. If he's sometimes hard to swallow. Use this.","I was always a character actor. I just looked like Little Red Riding Hood.","Acting isn't really a creative profession. It's an interpretative one.","Every time we get into an argument about cooking or laundering shirts, she shakes her Oscar at me, and I'm dead in the water. It would be a great equalizer now after 33 years.","George Roy Hill, Redford, and I have been looking for a script to do together for 13 years. We haven't been able to find one that we liked enough for the three of us to be in it together.","What is the difference between a truly creative artist and an interpretive artist? I have not concluded anything about that, but it's fair to ask the question.","It's kind of like those little electric bumper cars where you drive around and see if you can hit the other guy. That's exactly what the country is like now. You no longer have the sense of community. Of loyalty. It's lost its sense of group. It has nothing to do with leadership.","The nice thing about animation, you don't even really have to account for yourself. All of the physical stuff that you work on as an actor, you just throw away.","I have an extraordinary attention span. I manage to juggle two or three different ideas at the same time, and that's probably - if I have a gift, that's probably the best gift that's given me.","I'm not able to work anymore as an actor and still at the level I would want to... you start to lose your memory. You start to lose your confidence. You start to lose your invention. So, that's pretty much a closed book for me."],"Paul Nitze":["One of the most dangerous forms of human error is forgetting what one is trying to achieve.","We slow the progress of science today for all sorts of ethical reasons. Biomedicine could advance much faster if we abolished our rules on human experimentation in clinical trials, as Nazi researchers did."],"Paul Nurse":["I was never very good at exams, having a poor memory and finding the examination process rather artificial, and there never seemed to be enough time to follow up things that really interested me.","Better understanding of the natural world not only enhances all of us as human beings, but can also be harnessed for the better good, leading to improved health and quality of life.","I have an idealistic view of science as a liberalising and progressive force for humanity.","I am still a keen mountain walker and an enthusiastic glider pilot.","Therefore, I reasoned that study of the cell cycle responsible for the reproduction of cells was important and might even be illuminating about the nature of life.","A key issue in developmental biology at that time was the problem of how cells underwent differentiation, with most workers concentrating on explanations in terms of changes in enzyme and gene regulation.","After an extensive interview he arranged for my weaknesses in foreign languages to be over-looked and so I started a Biology degree at Birmingham in 1967.","At age 11 in 1960, I moved to an academic state secondary school, Harrow County Grammar School for Boys.","During the winter my attention was attracted to the changes in the stars and planets in the sky.","I decided that the University of Sussex in Brighton was a good place for this work because it had a strong tradition in bacterial molecular genetics and an excellent reputation in biology.","I felt strongly that since the pursuit of good science was so difficult it was essential that the problem being studied was an important one to justify the effort expanded.","I had a great time investigating the pigments of different mutant fruit flies by following experimental protocols published in Scientific American, and I also remember making my own beetle collection when it was still acceptable to make such collections.","I met my wife Anne who was a sociology student, and her influence together with activities associated with the student movement of the time opened up my interests amongst other things into the theatre, art, music, politics and philosophy.","I think it was this curiosity about the natural world which awoke my early interest in science.","I was by far the youngest of the family, and at times it was like being an only child.","It has been a privilege to pursue knowledge for its own sake and to see how it might help mankind in more practical ways.","It was during my time at secondary school that I abandoned religion.","Like many students, I found the drudgery of real experiments and the slowness of progress a complete shock, and at my low points I contemplated other alternative careers including study of the philosophy or sociology of science.","My 6 years with Murdoch were pivotal for my entire research career.","My main efforts focussed on trying to identify the rate controlling steps during the cell cycle. Crucial for this analysis were wee mutants that were advanced prematurely through the cell cycle and so divided at a reduced cell size.","My parents were born in Norfolk and spent their early years working in the big houses of that rural English county, my mother as a cook and my father as a handyman and chauffeur.","My parents were neither wealthy nor academic, but we lived comfortably and they were always extremely supportive of my academic efforts and aspirations, both at school and university.","Scientific understanding is often beautiful, a profoundly aesthetic experience which gives pleasure not unlike the reading of a great poem.","This possibility bothered me as I thought it was not advisable to remain in one academic environment, and the long dark winters in Edinburgh could be rather dismal.","This time at Birmingham turned me into a general biologist, and ever since then I have always tried to take a biological approach to any research project that I have undertaken."],"Paul O'Grady":["I make a wonderful cure-all called Four Thieves, just like my mum did. It's cider vinegar, 36 cloves of garlic and four herbs, representing four looters of plague victims' homes in 1665 who had their sentences reduced from burning at the stake to hanging for explaining the recipe that kept them from catching the plague.","I'd rather do community service than sit and write a load of Christmas cards.","I dress up as a middle-aged prostitute and do a game show.","I don't live with people, that's why my relationships last. I'm not romantic. Even when I was a teenager if somebody asked if they could hold my hand I'd say, - no, it's not heavy, I can hold it myself, thank you'.","The worst drivers are women in people carriers, men in white vans and anyone in a baseball cap. That's just about everyone.","I don't want to sound like Catherine Cookson but I've worked since I was eight, with a paper round and in a fruit and veg shop. Taking a pay cut won't demotivate me, not at all. It's not about money in the first place. It's about the job.","It's become normal for me to walk on set as Popeye, Frankenstein or an Elf or even a chicken.","Times are hard and friends are few.","I love looking after animals. I find it very enjoyable.","If I wanted your opinion, I'd slap it outta ya.","Channel 4 are a great bunch of people to work with and the crew are lovely. Working at ITV was like being in the court of Caligula.","I am quite happy to take a cut. You've got to, if you want to work and continue working.","Comedy, your funny bone, is formed in childhood.","I enjoyed school - although I ran away on the first day. I'd reminded the teacher that it was nearly time for 'Watch With Mother' on TV.","My primary school teacher once poured a bottle of curdled school milk forcefully down my throat. Then I threw it up all over her suede shoes. I'd rather have drunk from the spittoon in Barney's barber shop.","I was a really picky eater as a child. Because I was obsessed by Popeye, my mum and aunts would put my food in a can to represent spinach and we'd hum the Popeye tune and then I'd happily eat it.","Every week I have a disaster in my kitchen. The fire alarm goes off repeatedly. But it doesn't stop me being adventurous.","I go in the butchers and there's not a lot of meat I can eat these days, with having all the animals.","Taking a pay cut won't demotivate me, not at all. It's not about money in the first place. It's about the job.","I still consider myself working class. I know my circumstances have changed dramatically since I was growing up back in Birkenhead.","I've got four dogs, eight chickens, 10 sheep and six pigs.","When my dog Buster died, I couldn't get over it. I was in bits.","I can eat beef, provided it's minced in disguise. I couldn't eat a gammon steak. Forget it.","I don't like awards ceremonies. I'd sooner go to the pub with mates I've known for years.","I'm not a businessman. I could pack it in, but I like work. I don't want to sound like Catherine Cookson, but I've worked since I was eight, with a paper round and in a fruit and veg shop.","I think it's bad for fellas when they lose their mothers. Mine was such a character. Oh it was sad, really sad. And, with her gone, the family home was gone, so what was left of any roots I had were completely dug up.","You can draw the character out of pets, and you can make them your friends, but they are animals, and they have to be allowed to live the lives of animals.","I don't want to sit until I'm 90 with people running around after me. I'm not one for sitting on the couch.","Mum and Dad died of heart problems, my grandparents died of it, my sister has had mini strokes, my brother has had a heart attack - it's genetic; there's nothing I can do.","I know it's a cliche, but I didn't want to work in an office.","I like working with kids; they keep you going.","I only like doing live telly. It's great because you go in and do it and then go home. No edit, no retakes.","Writing is such a solitary existence, and I can only do it late at night.","I was born late - what my mother calls the last kick of a dying horse. There's three of us children, but I'm 13 or 14 years younger than my brother and sister.","I went to work for the Civil Service. I'd wanted to work for the Ministry of Defence because I had some far-fetched idea that it had something to do with the Avengers, but I ended up in Social Security.","I was Popeye mad when I was a kid, and I'd eat spinach until the cows came home.","I don't go for glamour roles.","The person I always enjoy having a meal with is Cilla Black. I might not see her for months, but then I'll pick her up at her flat, and we'll go to a restaurant, and it's like I've seen her that morning.","I like to travel, and I would love to be fluent in at least four languages."],"Paul O'Neill":["This meeting was like many of the meetings that I would go to over the course of two years. The only way I can describe it is that, well, the president is like a blind man in a roomful of deaf people. There is no discernible connection.","I'm not willing to say I want to return to private life because I'm too old to begin telling lies now.","I used some vivid language that, if I could take it back, I'd take it back. It's not my intention to be personally critical of the President or of anyone else.","I pray daily... for peace.","Our intention is to give people, however you might stylize it, a tax cut or a pay raise."],"Paul Oakenfold":["Shanghai set out to take over from Hong Kong and I think it's done that.

I look forward to expanding our horizons together.","I wish my friends at William Morris Endeavor all the best.","When I started DJ'ing, it was no big thing. There was no money in DJ'ing, and you did it purely for the love of playing music.","There is a definite Chinese pop sound developing, but I was shocked at how influenced it is by American music.","I'm about to start working with a singer I met on my last trip: she'll get international exposure, and I'll have a song out in that market sung in Cantonese.","I've been going to China every year now for more than a decade."],"Paul Park":["I think it's no coincidence that people who are good at writing far-out fiction are also good at meta-fiction. Think of all the best Phillip K. Dick stories, where you experience a sort of dislocation, and suddenly what you think you've been reading is, in fact, something else entirely.","Meta-fiction doesn't depend on the illusion that you're reading about real people.","Modernist fiction is tied to problems of writers. Self-glorifying. Existential struggle. This has not been a big part of genre writing.","Sometimes, a writer 'character' is just a projection of a person who is writing the story, but not necessarily 'me.'"],"Paul Parker":["The best indication is that I still love to ski on most anything, from skating gear to heavy metal.","For me, being able to go anywhere you want, with an element of precision and control, has been the goal.","I wanted to feel that precision and control and then try to apply it to tele. That's what I've looked for in my gear development through the years, and today, tele is very precise, very high-performance.","One item on my agenda is simply planning trips, setting them as goals, something to look forward to.","Challenging snow is one of my favorite kinds of skiing, and I like being able to switch techniques at liberty.","There are many skiers who have chosen tele for a more compact, streamlined skiing system.","Allow me a bit of philosophy here... We started tele skiing as a rebellion against rules.","We have to be careful about creating more rules.","Feeling a part of that community is my greatest reward."],"Paul Pierce":["Life changes when you have a child, when you have your own family. You become more careful about what you do. You're not going to be out late, going out to clubs, hanging out with your friends. You're going to be at home, taking care of your daughter, playing with her.","I always wanted a little brother because I felt like the little brother had to do everything.","A lot of things change in the playoffs.","When you win a championship, it is a great feeling, and you really don't want that feeling to go away.","There's a line that separates having confidence and being conceited. I don't cross that line, but I have a lot of confidence in myself.","When you play on bad defensive teams, you get labeled as a bad defender.","The game isn't over till the clock says zero.","You've got to put in the work. And you've got to play with confidence. You've got to believe in yourself.","My strength comes from my mom. Just seeing what she had to go through to raise us, she wouldn't make excuses; she wouldn't put her head down. So I guess I looked at adversity right in the eye and took it on.","You've got to be able to finish out the season on a strong note.","Boston is always going to be a second home for me.","Usually, when you win the championship, you party all summer and don't work out. But when I won, I mean, I had my good times, but I used it as motivation to do it again. When you realize you can accomplish something so great, you want to do it again.","I think you're a product of your influences, your environment. You see guys with so much talent, but they got the wrong people around them telling them the wrong things. They wind up going down the wrong path.","People don't understand the power of love and family and strength.","I'm happy I'm able to leave a legacy behind. I'm happy I was able to win a championship. I have no regrets about nothing.","Good things only can last so long.","I think the most important thing I work on is just my mental approach to every day, my mental approach to the game. How to come in each and every day focused, doing what I want to do, I think that's just the biggest issue.","I majored in criminal justice. I like 'CSI,' all that, '24.' I watch those shows on A&E, if I watch TV. I don't really watch TV shows.","When you gotta go through something tough, I've always been a guy that just wants to get it out of the way.","We used to play 'Double Dribble' on Nintendo. Later, in high school, it was more 'NBA Live' and 'John Madden Football.'","The gym was my sanctuary. The place where you could forget about all your worries, your problems, people asking you for money, people asking you to do this, do that.","Personally, I think I've got split personalities, and I may need a psychiatrist. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Seriously. I'm serious about this.","I always say I wish I was in my prime matching up against LeBron. Let's see how many championships he would have won then.","Kobe is one of the best scorers in NBA history, but I don't have as much trouble with him in the post as I do with Carmelo.","I like the Raiders. That's my favorite team.","The rim is looking bigger and bigger every game.","I probably visualize myself, the shots I'm going to get in the game, how I'm going to play defense, what we have to do to stop the other team's best player, what it's going to take out of me, the whole aspect of the game.","Once people start making comparisons to a player of the past, they want you to be that player. I try to go out there and create my own image, my own style, my own type of game. Right now I can't even think of one guy I've been compared to.","At the beginning of the season, I set my goal to see if I can lead the league in scoring, because I feel I have that kind of ability. A lot of guys say it, but it's not really in their grasp. I feel that's really in my grasp.","I've always been a late bloomer. My body developed late. From ninth to 10th grade, I grew like 3 inches. Just kind of stretched out. I was like 6-1, grew to 6-4 in 10th grade.","I worked at a hospital for a week. And at a golf course when I was in college at Kansas for about a week. The tips weren't good so I quit.","Kids get influenced by other kids.","A lot of players know I've been around 13 years and this is my second lockout. I got a lot of respect. I know what's going on both for the league and the union.","I'm a competitive player, and I love being on the court. If the NBA cancels the season I'm definitely looking at my options and considering going overseas.","'A Christmas Story' is my favorite Christmas movie.","Ubuntu is about a community coming together to help one another.","A lot of people that I've had around me have been my closest friends since junior high, back when we were exchanging each other's clothes, staying at each other's houses. That was before I had anything.","I'm a competitive person. I love the game of basketball. I'm a gym rat.","I've never been in a gang. None of my friends have been in a gang. I've never rolled around with big entourages.","The Celtics don't celebrate anything but championships.","When you give a team life, give a team confidence, anything can happen in a Game 7.","You know coaches. Sometimes they ramble.","Mostly I play sports games - football and basketball. 'Inside Drive' and 'NFL Fever.'","I've never been on the cover of a game. When people go into the store and see me on the cover of a game, maybe that will entice them to buy it.","My favorite quarterback is Donovan McNabb. I think he's a complete quarterback. I love the way he can scramble and throw on the run. He can do it all. He can control a game.","'Pulp Fiction' is my favorite movie of all time.","My brother was a huge Charles Barkley fan - my brother went to Miami. He played power forward, and he always used to tell me stories about Barkley and college. And I watched Barkley growing up. I loved what he brought to the game. His toughness and just his attitude, being as strong he was.","Just soaking up the history of the Boston Celtics has been the best thing that's happened to me as a player.","In college, I probably lost a total of about 11 games, and then I came to the Celtics and in my first three weeks we went on a nine-game losing streak.","I can't remember last time I had a soda. It tastes like acid to me now.","The media in Utah is not the same as the media in New York, so that can wear on some people.","The NBA is changing so much. It's not like when I came up, with that old-school mentality that practice really mattered.","The '80s, '90s, and early 2000s genes of competitive fire are dead and gone.","I think I've had an illustrious career.","It's just something I've always loved to do: talk basketball. It's easy for me to give my perspective, my analyst approach to it, because even when I played, I would watch film, talk about the game.","I'm a basketball junkie and a real historian of the game, so for me to get a chance to express it and give my perspective on a national stage, I'm really enjoying it.","I knew I wasn't going to be a scientist; I knew that early. When they started talking about dissecting frogs, I knew I wasn't going to be a scientist.","I listened to Tupac and a lot of Biggie Smalls.","I was a typical K-Swiss guy with sweatsuits. I was a ball player, so the ballers, we wore our game shorts to class. We didn't really have a fashion in high school like other kids.","You definitely gotta get more rest as an older player than you did when you were young. You're young, full of energy. You're out, up late, watching movies or out hanging out with your friends.","You see more friendships in the league. It's not like in the '80s when you had enemies, or you couldn't stand this guy, and there were fights all the time.","I've got three beautiful kids that wear me out after I get home from practice. I think that's a good thing so I'm able to get my rest.","I just think it's really upsetting when you see a community just go out and burn down stores and trash cars.","If I had to single one guy out who is the most difficult player to guard in the league, it would have to be Carmelo.","LeBron is a great post-up player, but if you get him to settle for the jumper on some nights, you might be able to slow him down if his shot is off.","It's crazy how people just don't care sometimes about the kids they have.","I want to be the dad that my father never was.","I respect our greats. I admire them.","You can actually get calls by yelling, 'And one!' as you release.","I think too much of my leadership is done the bad way.","Understanding who you are is saying, 'You're great; you have tons of confidence, and don't ever forget that.' And that helped me, man. Because when things weren't going right, I thought, 'You've got to remember who you are. Don't stray from that. Don't let these things get you down.'","Understanding history means knowing what motivates you.","I'm an old-school guy. I'm a competitor.","I understand when you have great players on losing teams who are tired of losing, struggling in the playoffs every year. You're the lone star. I've been in that position.","Every kid who just played basketball knew about the Boston Celtics. They're one of the few teams who were always on national TV along with the Lakers.","I originally was more into baseball and football, but being in Los Angeles, you just couldn't help but to fall in love with the game of basketball because they had such a winning tradition.","If they're not talking about you, you're not doing something; you're not doing anything. So if they're talking about you, you may be doing something right. And when they talk bad about you, you just use it for motivation.","You can't listen to every little thing that's bad or good said about you. I always used that - whenever I heard it, I used it as fuel to motivate me, man. That's how I was raised, whenever I came up.","When you come off a losing season - one of the worst seasons in all of basketball - and get guys like Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett, two perennial All-Stars, we felt like we had a championship team.","Sometimes when general managers get a new job, they clean house and start over and rebuild and get the players they want in there.","Injuries are a big factor when you're trying to go on a championship run.","After 18 NBA years, it's hard to believe I'll be playing in each arena for the last time.","I'm not a guy who goes into the neighborhood, gets beat up by the bully's gang, and then now I want to join their gang. That's just not me. I wanna fight - let's go! I mean, I'm gonna stand up for myself. That's just the competitive nature of where I come from, the era I grew up in.","These seasons, as you get older, they just are so long and draining.","That is one of my greatest strengths. I am not afraid to face challenges or any matchup in the league.","I just love the pressure, truthfully, man.","I love the fact that I get to play against the Los Angeles Lakers in a Game 7 on the road.","I love the fact that, if I don't win multiple championships, that I probably won't be mentioned amongst the other guys in Celtics history who've done it before. That type of stuff motivates me.","Dislike is what creates rivalries.","I respect LeBron. People think we have a hate for each other, but I totally respect what he's done.","If I see LeBron walking down the street, it's not going to be no fistfight. I've got a lot of respect for him.","It's just something about great players when they play in certain arenas or against other great players. They elevate their play. LeBron is one of those guys. He feels the moment. He understands the moment.","Kids are the most genuine thing to me: everything they say and do, they mean it.","Eating right is part of my lifestyle now.","I didn't have a dad around to pick me up when I fell, throw the ball to me outside. I always wonder how it would be if I did have a dad there.","I found my father through other people, through my older brothers, my high school coaches, so I had men influences along the way who helped me.","I love walking the streets of New York.","The fans of New York are very knowledgeable about the game of basketball. They love their sports here.","It's no secret that me and New York got history. It's no secret. This is no secret. It's already known.","I remember I didn't know who Jason Williams was, and he got drafted ahead of me. It was just weird. I thought I'd be in the top five, and I slipped all the way to 10, so it was a strange night for me.","I've been around this game for a long time - a lot of plane rides, a lot of bus rides, a lot of pregame speeches, a lot of national anthems.","I always thrive on wanting to play against the best.","Winning's not easy. In order to win, you've got to see the best.","When I set my goals, I set them to where they fit within the team concept.","I really don't use a personal trainer.","I play a lot of pick-up games; I run a lot on my own.","When you're a young player, and you're starting to scratch your potential, you don't know how good you can be.","When Shaq gave me the nickname, it wasn't no Joe-Bob giving you a nickname. This is Shaq. It was like, whoa.","I love getting up - in the summer, I get up at 5:30, 6 just to go train.","I knew guys way more talented than me who fell through the cracks.","I've always been known as a pure scorer, and I've always said if I just sat outside and shot 3s and just really focused on that - coming off of screens and spot-up 3s - and shot six or seven 3s a game, I would probably be more known as one of the greatest shooters in NBA history.","I take the opportunity 3s, and I think I'm one of the better shooters.","What people don't understand is the summertime is motivation - how willing you're willing to work for the upcoming season - and I think, as older players, once you see that drive fall off in the summer, then I think it's time to hang it up.","People probably won't even remember I played for the Clippers.","When you're not winning in your last couple of years, it gets frustrating because where's your motivation?","Old-school guys, they don't need to see the doctor, the massage therapist. We'd come in when we was 21; we'd go right to the court and start shooting.","I've always been the Rodney Dangerfield of this game. Maybe it was meant to be that way, but that always drove me.","If somebody said, 'You're going to be the Number 1 pick; you're going to have a great team around you all these years'? It would've been too easy.","I want to see my child grow.","I want to be there for my daughter - when she falls, to pick her up. When she needs help with homework.","A lot of people don't know this: when I was young, I wanted to be a garbage man. I asked my mom, and she said they made good money, and it was steady work.","I've been talking basketball pretty much my whole life.","I am a confident player, and a lot of people might look at it like, 'Oh, another cocky attitude,' but I don't look at it that way.","I have an opinion. I have a right to have one, and that's the way I feel.","Everybody knows how much I disliked the Knicks when I was with the Celtics, but I think it's grown to another level.","I don't have to use anything to motivate me, a trade or anything like that, for me to say I want to win a championship.","I want to be that guy that says I was one of the first guys to put a banner in Brooklyn.","When you go against the best... a lot of series are won on fear factor or the non-belief. When you have that non-belief, then you have no chance.","The whole business of basketball with China, it's just a huge business that enables us to come over and connect with them and continue that fan affair.","I'm the classic case of a great player on a bad team, and it stinks.","I give my honest opinion, whether it's right or wrong, but it's an opinion that I'll make.","Everybody is entitled to an honest opinion.","When you've been around the game so much for so many years, it's just like it's a part of you."],"Paul Pogba":["I only think about the pitch. I want to do great. I want to be one of the best. I want to win titles. I want to achieve things.","Outside football, I just love life, you know. We're lucky to play football, to have all this body. Everyone's watching us. You see how many people, they come and watch the game. It's unbelievable, you see how many people they come. They shout your name and just enjoy life.","They teach you some things, but football is instinct sometimes. You just get the ball, and sometimes you dribble past three players and pass it; other times, you can shoot from far away. It's just instinct. If you feel something, just do it. I am free to do that.","My deepest respect to the clubs who considered having me.","I'm someone who says what he thinks.","I don't think I am a great. I think I've done nothing. I've done nothing in soccer. I've won leagues, but I haven't won the Champions League, the World Cup, the Euro. Winning the Euro in France, that wouldn't be bad.","I wasn't really interested in girls. Only football. I was just enjoying football all the time. There was a five-a-side next to the flat, and I used to play there all the time. It was all about football. I wanted to be a professional. That was my goal. I didn't want to be anything other than a footballer.","I have to keep working hard and playing well because I don't like to be second or third: they're the worst places to be. You would be proud, of course, because it means you're on the way, but you want to finish first.","My family always helped me. I had people around me who always pushed me to be the best: my dad, my mum. My dad used to play and coach as well. But I wasn't born with shiny things.","I'm sure Mourinho will make me a better player and a better person.","Playing against an Italian team is harder than all the other leagues. The Italians won't score lots of goals, but they won't concede many, either.","I grew up in a flat with my brothers and my cousins. My brothers were in the same bed.","I wanted to show the world, to show United that I was ready to play and I was motivated to play. This comeback just showed that I left United, but the power of my heart was still here, to be honest.","The real Pogba is the one you see every time. You know, when I'm on the pitch, I cannot act. I'm not an actor. So when I'm in the pitch, I like to joke and laugh, and outside the pitch, I'm the same. For me, I'm normal. I come and play football. I do what I love.","Because I'm fairly big, I like to use my body. So I'll control the ball, even when there's a player on me, and then I'll pass.","All players rolled into one: from defensive midfielder to attacking midfielder to attacker. I want to take the qualities from everyone. I'd like to get to the level where I have everything: Vieira, Deschamps, Zidane, Ronaldinho, Henry, Ronaldo. It wouldn't be bad, that.","I came back to Carrington, and it was like I just came back home.","I always dream about winning the Ballon d'Or.","I'm more experienced, I've won titles at Juventus. I've been playing with big players like when I started at Man United, of course. I came back. I've not come back from the Academy now; I went to play somewhere else, and I came back, I would say, as a person, as an adult."],"Paul Polman":["Safe working conditions, fair wages, protection from forced labor, and freedom from harassment and discrimination - these must become standard global operating conditions.","Sustainability makes good business sense, and we're all on the same team at the end of the day. That's the truth about the human condition.","Our political leaders have great responsibilities, but as with many situations in life, people often rise or fall to meet your expectations. Our responsibility as citizens is to expect our leaders to lead and to give them enough support so that they may do so.","Working together on solving something requires a high level of humility and a high level of self-awareness.","Renewable energy could reduce emissions but also create jobs and improve public health.","Looking at the world through a sustainability lens not only helps us 'future proof' our supply chain, it also fuels innovation and drives brand growth.","Every few decades, we have an opportunity to make a drastic change to the way we live our lives. We get a chance to design the building blocks of our daily routines, the infrastructure that will support and accompany us for the years to come - from the trains and trams we ride, the offices we work in, to the energy that powers our homes.","When women are provided with training and entrepreneurial opportunities in distribution networks, they become role models in their communities, showing it is possible to challenge limiting norms and stereotypes, and to succeed.","There are some basic human needs that are the same. Everybody wants to succeed.","Climate change is sometimes misunderstood as being about changes in the weather. In reality it is about changes in our very way of life.","I believe that the financial crisis of 2008/9 exposed more a lack of ethics and morality - especially by the financial sector - rather than a problem of regulation or criminality. There were, of course, regulatory lessons to be learned, but at heart, there was a collective loss of our moral compass.","If we all act together - business, governments, NGOs and citizens and, especially, the young - just imagine the good we could create.","When we empower women, society benefits, grows, and thrives.","I don't subscribe to, 'Here are the top ten tips to successful leadership,' or, 'How to learn leadership in ten minutes.' A leader is someone who gives positive energy to others which then results in a better change than would have happened. I think everyone is a leader.","It's easy to be a short-term hero. It is very easy for me to get tremendous results very short term, get that translated into compensation, and be off sailing in the Bahamas. But the goal for this company - and it's very difficult to do - the goal is to follow a four- or five-year process.","Runaway climate change would condemn millions to a life of poverty and cause us to fail to meet the Sustainable Development Goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030. This is not an acceptable outcome.","It cannot be right in a world of increasing human progress - whether in medicine, space exploration or renewable energy - that so many people are denied the most basic human rights.","If we tackle deforestation in the right way, the benefits will be far-reaching - greater food security, improved livelihoods for millions of small farmers and indigenous people, more prosperous rural economies, and above all, a more stable climate.","Practically, systemic thinking can be used to identify problems, analyze their boundaries, design strategies and policy interventions, forecast and measure their expected impacts, implement them, and monitor and evaluate their successes and failures.","The planet's forests are essential for life.","Business must go on reiterating its absolute commitment to embedding human rights in all it does, driving industry change through collaboration with governments, international organizations, and each other.","The moral case for gender equality is obvious. It should not need any explanation.","The basic skills of leaders are always the same: be driven by a deeper purpose, be a human being, have a passion for what you do, and it's also about hard work and ethics.","While we have created prosperity for many, too many are being left behind.","Large-scale deforestation can be prevented while increasing food production through better, smarter agriculture.","As a consumer goods company serving billions of consumers every day, Unilever understands the drivers and motivations that create the norms that lie behind people's behaviour.","It is our responsibility as businesses to deliver ambitious solutions and technologies to bring us low-carbon, inclusive and sustainable growth.","At the end of the day, people will follow you or people will be energised by you if they buy into your vision or purpose. So the most important thing is to be true to yourself. That's why I would say to be a great leader - you, first and foremost, have to be a great human being. And sharing that purpose and sharing the values.","If too many people feel excluded from the system and cannot access its benefits, they will ultimately rebel against it.","System-wide changes rely on a critical mass of interested parties, all willing to enter into deep partnerships and collaborations, founded on new levels of trust and a commitment to action, not debate.","We need new, dynamic models for growth through the sharing economy, using big data to unlock new insights and adopting closed-loop cycles.","Land is a great example of how we can manage and invest in sustainable infrastructure for economic, social, and environmental gains. Its use - and misuse - is at the heart of the challenge for food, fuel, and fibre.","I see business as an ecosystem.","Why would you invest in a company which is out of synch with the needs of society, that does not take its social compliance in its supply chain seriously, that does not think about the costs of externalities or of its negative impacts on society?","There are billions of people in the world who deserve the better quality of life that products such as soap, shampoo, and clean drinking water can provide.","As economies have evolved, the nature of work has always changed.","Companies are the first to see the costs of climate change.","I think the most important thing is to achieve what you set out to achieve. Just being a CEO in itself is not success. I would not relate success to a title or a position.","My career has been a level of serendipity all along. I've never planned anything out more than a few years. All the places we lived - the 12, 13 countries - and the companies I worked for were a combination of circumstances.","I work a lot with blind people in my spare time outside of Unilever, and I count my blessings every day.","My own fear, if I have one myself, is a fear of being obsolete. This is a world that changes very fast, and one of the main human desires is to belong to, to be part of, something. It's probably one of our greatest needs next to oxygen.","For Unilever, investing in women is an imperative. The business and social cases for doing so are inextricably linked.","The ideal is a world in which every woman and girl can create the kind of life she wishes to lead, unconstrained by harmful norms and stereotypes.","Businesses and governments need to work together and make a joint commitment if we want to address climate change effectively and quickly.","Africa is a vibrant, varied continent with a growing consumer base.","Every region in the world faces challenges - and Africa is hugely diverse, so its own challenges are varied.","Africa's vibrancy and entrepreneurial spirit is un-matched. There's huge potential here to grow business, create jobs, and to improve living standards.","Unilever brings together the resources and experience of a multinational company alongside our deep local roots, which enables us to grow a genuinely African consumer goods business.","My father worked in a tyre factory. My mother worked as a teacher.","I've always been bothered by systems that don't work for everybody. It doesn't mean we're all equal. I am not naive about that. But we should have a more inclusive society.","P&G started in 1837, Nestle in 1857. These companies have been around for so long because they are in tune with society. They are very responsible companies, despite the challenges that they sometimes deal with, all the criticism they get.","Unilever has been around for 100-plus years. We want to be around for several hundred more years.","Leadership is not a contest of likeability. Leadership often boils down to making the tougher choices. You are not in a popularity contest.","I wanted to be a priest. I could have done that. I wanted to be a doctor. I could have done that. Circumstances didn't lead me to it, so my fallback option was business. I wasn't really motivated to this.","I actually am a capitalist, and I believe in shareholders. But I believe in them as a result of what I do, not as a reason for what I'm doing. The same with profits - profits alone cannot be an objective. It has to have a purpose.","The world faces enormous human development and environmental challenges, from poverty and disease to food security and climate change.","We cannot eliminate poverty without enabling developing countries to engage more people in economic activity that use natural resources, and we cannot resolve runaway climate change without creating wealth in a more equitable and less carbon intensive way.","Left unchecked, climate change risks not only making the poorest poorer, but pulling the emerging middle classes back into poverty, too.","We need more food, more forests, better livelihoods for smallholder farmers, and lower emissions. If we want any of them, we must have all of them.","Providing financial incentives for both local communities and national governments to conserve and restore forests also makes sense. It will put an economic value on these precious natural resources and drive the right behaviours from both government and business.","Addressing the weaknesses of capitalism will require us, above all, to do two things: first, to take a long-term perspective, and second, to re-set the priorities of business.","The great challenge of the 21st century is to provide good standards of living for 7 billion people without depleting the earth's resources or running up massive levels of public debt. To achieve this, government and business alike will need to find new models of growth that are in both environmental and economic balance.","Taking proactive action on climate change is essential to ensuring that Unilever remains a viable business in the future. We will also reap the benefits in innovation, new product development, and cost efficiencies.","Permissible growth in the future has to be based on sustainable and equitable models.","The commitment to put an end to illegal deforestation and develop sustainable alternatives for commodities like palm oil and soy, for example, is an inspiring illustration of what can be achieved when governments and industry partners come together determined to bring about transformational market-wide changes.","At Unilever, we operate in 190 countries with two billion people using our products daily. We take climate seriously because we know that it impacts those two billion people - and that means it impacts us, too.","When the climate hurts, people and businesses also feel the pain.","Leading businesses are making large strides in ensuring a sustainable future, but ultimately, they can only do so much.","To achieve policy stability and certainty, we need to establish a meaningful price on carbon and cut the billions of dollars spent each year on fossil-fuel subsidies, along with well-structured financial tools and rules.","If the world wants a climate deal and new development agenda that's good for the economy, for the poor, and for businesses, the path forward needs to include forests.","Forest nations willing to do more than their fair share to solve the climate crisis should be rewarded through results-based payments.","Simply put, the low-carbon economy is better for growth.","Around the world, businesses and investors are increasingly taking action to climate-proof their own organizations.","Business has a responsibility and opportunity to be the driving force for the advancement of universal human rights.","In certain cases, empowering women starts with making their lives easier and removing unnecessary burdens.","Many businesses understand the advantages of gender parity.","Let's work together to make our economies strong and our climate sustainable. It can be done.","It is not possible to have a strong, functioning business in a world of increasing inequality, poverty, and climate change.","Purpose has always been part of Unilever's DNA. Our founder, William Lever, built a business around the sale of Lifebuoy soap that was not only profitable and sustainable but also helped transform the health of the poor in Victorian Britain.","More and more businesses are seeing the potential of a more sustainable business model, driven both by the firm belief that business can be a force for good and by the realization that the cost of inaction often exceeds the cost of action - notably when it comes to the growing threat of climate change and water scarcity.","Consumers in both emerging and developed markets want it all - high-performing products, the right price, and a purpose that they can connect with.","We all have responsibility to stop violence and discrimination against women, whether it's in our businesses, in our homes, or on our streets.","Empowering women is one of the most important things we - and indeed, every business - can do.","At Unilever, we are committed to building an inclusive organisation where all individuals feel safe, valued, and supported - irrespective of gender, background, or any other difference.","The young give us hope because young people are certain their best days still lie ahead - which explains why they're absolutely convinced they can change the world for the better.","We can no longer pretend that business is immune from the rising tide of environmental or social challenges or that companies can create value in isolation from the communities of which they are a part.","It only takes a handful of sizeable companies to reach a tipping point and to transform markets.","I grew up in a small town in the Netherlands which, for years, had been a center of textile production.","As CEO of Unilever, my personal mission is to galvanize our company to be an effective force for good.","If the short-term decisions you make damage the long term, you should resist those. But there are many short-term decisions that you need to make to be a successful manager.","There is still too much pressure on short-termism in terms of the drivers of success.","I say to a lot of people you have to measure success in terms of progress, not in terms of end state.","Too many companies are running their business into the ground, I would argue, by being myopically short-term focused on the shareholder.","I do not work for the shareholder, to be honest. I work for the customer.","You can put yourself to the purpose of others, and in doing so, you can be better off.","I am very confident about the Modi government.","I discovered a long time ago that if I focus on doing the right thing for the long term to improve the lives of consumers and customers all over the world, the business results will come.","Too often, we are being programmed by the environment around us to behave differently. But I think a true leader is an authentic person who feels good about who he is.","I don't have a problem crying when I need to cry.","Often people ask me what my job is, and I say, honestly, it is to make others successful, and the more you do that, the more you will see that you create prosperity."],"Paul Provenza":["When I was a young comic just starting out, I was very cautious, as I didn't want to alienate people. George Carlin's bravery became a benchmark. I became perfectly fine with alienating some people in the audience. That just comes with the territory.","George Carlin maintained that anything and everything is funny given the right context. This context also includes your own history with a given group. What I can get away with and where I can go is not a problem with my audience because they know me.","Comedy is inherently subversive because it turns the normal reality on its head. The art form is all about these questions and contradictions. In comedy, we're dealing with language that we all understand, but words can have a dozen other things around them that alter or affect meaning.","Social media allows comics to bypass the gatekeepers and connect directly with people who will want to come see them.","Career is a mindset. The wrong mindset. Career is linear. Especially when you are trapped in the TV or film world. The next thing you do has always got to be bigger, or it is perceived as a failure."],"Paul Prudhomme":["You don't need a silver fork to eat good food.","It's the sense of what family is at the dinner table. It was the joy of knowing mother was in the kitchen making our favorite dish. I wish more people would do this and recall the joy of life.","When I am done with this meal you can have my life. It is heaven.","I think the most wonderful thing in the world is another chef. I'm always excited about learning new things about food.","When I travel I normally eat club sandwiches or I bring my own food. When you go into a new town, it's very had to find a good place to eat.","When you've got a great business going, you go open another and take the risk of losing the whole thing. It's fun!","I wait for the next opportunity to have something to do with food. If I get rested, my mind just starts creating new dishes - click, click, click.","What I think and what the world thinks is totally different.","We trust something in a grocery store and assume it's good. We don't learn about the most precious thing in life-the food we put in our body. Educate yourself!","We had no electricity, no gas. Food was probably our greatest entertainment - the most fun thing that we could do was food.","We didn't do wrong things because we didn't want to embarrass our parents.","We closed the restaurant in New Orleans and brought the entire staff to San Francisco. But we had to go home.","We're working people, and that's what we like to do, work.","Some people absorb in different ways. I didn't realize until I was 15 years old how much I retained.","One of the problems of our youth is that the family unit is broken up. When we'd sit down to dinner together as a family, we'd learn about each other. We had something people don't get today.","One of my missions was to teach.","My mother would put me on a wooden box at the stove and tell me to call her if certain things would happen. Like if the steam turns blue, that is danger!","In '71 or '72 I returned to New Orleans and stayed there. I started cooking Louisiana food. Of all the things I had cooked, it was the best-and it was my heritage.","If you have acid in food, you need to sugar it. At a high temperature, the acids are changed to sugar.","The bad part about being recognized is that when I walk into a restaurant and sit down, I've got to eat everything on the plate, whether it's good or bad. People would take it as an insult if I did otherwise.","I would work as a cook, get a little money, then open another restaurant.","I opened my own restaurant when I was 17. I went broke, then traveled around the country, learning about different kinds of foods, had three other restaurants that went broke. It didn't all start just a few years ago!","I opened a restaurant that had nothing but California wines.","I love people, and I'm excited that I can turn them on.","I don't think life is to be taken too seriously. Take it too seriously, and it'll getcha.","I didn't want to do just another set of recipes. I think that's useless.","I believe in America. I'm one of those silly flag wavers.","I'm just here and I'm doin' the best I can. If you don't understand that, then what can I do?","I'm a professional cook. I've worked with other cooks from all over the world, but my family is not that way - they're always lived within 25 miles of my hometown!","I'd like to have the first restaurant that can deliver incredible quality food to your table at your house at any time-right where you live.","Have fun. Do something nobody else had done before, or has done since.","Don't get fancy. Have you cooked an apple pie? You don't know what you did wrong? Do this: Take two or three apples. Put them on a table. Study them.","Creole is New Orleans city food. Communities were created by the people who wanted to stay and not go back to Spain or France.","Cajun is country food by farmers and fisherman that arrived in Louisiana from Acadiana, Canada.","After failing four times and after working for other people and realizing that nobody paid attention to the food like they should have, we wanted to just pay attention to the food and service."],"Paul Putner":["I just want to keep creating stuff, work regularly and learn how to use a computer properly.","I liked playing Morph in Mash and Peas and doing Phil Daniels in the Blur Rock Profile was a giggle too.","I remember going to my school careers advisor and asked about jobs that required scuba divers. It was a phase.","I wear so many disguises on the show that only a real comedy fan might spot me."],"Paul Quantrill":["Long Toss! Far and away themost important drill for strengthening my arm.","Don't just expect the scouts to find you. Go to camps, clinics and make sure you are seen.","MLB has become overly active, actively involved in the game, the on-the-field game. They're trying to run the game the way they want to and you just have to play along with it, deal with it.","I wanted to make a lot of good pitches."],"Paul R. Ehrlich":["To err is human, but to really foul things up you need a computer.","The National Academy of Sciences would be unable to give a unanimous decision if asked whether the sun would rise tomorrow.","The first rule of intelligent tinkering is to save all the parts.","I see harm reduction as a way of engaging people as part of that path to recovery.","We're one of the most highly regulated industries, and we have to pay attention to what government is doing."],"Paul Rand":["Design is a way of life, a point of view. It involves the whole complex of visual communications: talent, creative ability, manual skill, and technical knowledge. Aesthetics and economics, technology and psychology are intrinsically related to the process.","Simplicity is not the goal. It is the by-product of a good idea and modest expectations.","I haven't changed my mind about modernism from the first day I ever did it... It means integrity; it means honesty; it means the absence of sentimentality and the absence of nostalgia; it means simplicity; it means clarity. That's what modernism means to me.","Copy, art, and typography should be seen as a living entity; each element integrally related, in harmony with the whole, and essential to the execution of an idea.","Good design doesn't date. Bad design does.","Pictures, abstract symbols, materials, and colors are among the ingredients with which a designer or engineer works. To design is to discover relationships and to make arrangements and rearrangements among these ingredients.","To design is much more than simply to assemble, to order, or even to edit: it is to add value and meaning, to illuminate, to simplify, to clarify, to modify, to dignify, to dramatize, to persuade, and perhaps even to amuse. To design is to transform prose into poetry.","Ideas do not need to be esoteric to be original or exciting.","Without the aesthetic, the computer is but a mindless speed machine, producing effects without substance, form without relevant content, or content without meaningful form.","If I was influenced by anything, it was architecture: structure having to do with logic. If you don't do it right, the whole thing is going to cave in. In a certain sense, you can carry that to graphic design. Fortunately, however, nobody is going to die if you do it wrong.","You can't criticize geometry. It's never wrong.","The principal role of a logo is to identify, and simplicity is its means... Its effectiveness depends on distinctiveness, visibility, adaptability, memorability, universality, and timelessness.","Design is the method of putting form and content together. Design, just as art, has multiple definitions; there is no single definition. Design can be art. Design can be aesthetics. Design is so simple, that's why it is so complicated.","If a company is second rate, the logo will eventually be perceived as second rate. It is foolhardy to believe that a logo will do its job immediately, before an audience has been properly conditioned.","There's a certain kind of research you have to listen to - the factual stuff, not opinion. Facts are facts. Sugar is sweet - it's not a matter of opinion. It just is.","Design is everything. Everything!","Graphic Design, which fulfills aesthetic needs, complies with the laws of form and exigencies of two-dimensional space; which speaks in semiotics, sans-serifs, and geometrics; which abstracts, transforms, translates, rotates, dilates, repeats, mirrors, groups, and regroups, is not good design if it is irrelevant.","Artistic tricks divert from the effect that an artist endeavors to produce, and even excellent elements such as bullets, arrows, brackets, ornate initials, are at best superficial ornamentation unless logically employed.","Graphic design, which evokes the symmetria of Vituvius, the dynamic symmetry of Hambidge, the asymmetry of Mondrian; which is a good gestalt, generated by intuition or by computer, by invention or by a system of coordinates, is not good design if it does not communicate.","The reason I always insisted on signing my work was not to be subordinate to anyone.","Asymmetric balance creates greater reader interest. Pleasure derived from observing asymmetrical arrangements lies partly in overcoming resistances, which, consciously or not, the spectator adjusts in his own mind.","Providing, meaning to a mass of unrelated needs, ideas, words and pictures - it is the designer's job to select and fit this material together and make it interesting.","In the Orthodox religion, you don't draw the human figure. It's against the rules.","I was too practical to want to be a painter.","Any system that sees aesthetics as irrelevant, that separates the artist from his product, that fragments the work of the individual, or creates by committee, or makes mincemeat of the creative process will, in the long run, diminish not only the product but the maker as well.","I never did calligraphy... But handwriting is an entirely different kind of thing. It's part of the syndrome of modernism... It's part of that asceticism.","I would say that an understanding of man's intrinsic needs, and of the necessity to search for a climate in which those needs could be realized, is fundamental to the education of the designer.","In the West, we look at art through life. Well, that's one way of living. In the Orient they look at life through art. They even drink their tea without sugar, for the same reason that they don't like a lot of frilly decorations on a painting. I can't stand butter on my bread for the same reason. I'm allergic to goo and rococo.","A style is the consequence of recurrent habits, restraints, or rules invented or inherited, written or overheard, intuitive or preconceived."],"Paul Reiser":["But at the same time that the experience is pulling you apart, it's also bonding you. You have this joint venture! You both made this baby. And that's the thing I still can't get over.","We had the boy's name picked out, but we didn't have a girl's. When he turned out to be a boy, we were so relieved. Literally, in the middle of contracting and pushing, and with my wife being drugged - out and half - lucid, we were still coming up with names.","Field of Dreams is the only movie - and I saw it in the theater - on an afternoon when I was on location somewhere, and there were like 12 people in the theater. I was just so devastated; I couldn't get out of my seat. And I sat and watched it a second time.","And after you've done the acting, there's a lot of places you can put your input - in the editing, in the production of it, in the rewriting of it and so on.","This is not the most right I've ever been.","We made this movie for $17, and nobody got anything. So it never dawned on me that we would get real people.","We have such a long, familiar history with Peter Falk. The minute his mug is on that screen people smile.","Upstate New York in the middle of October. You can't get more beautiful than that.","They're not the sharpest people - babies. So, you must be everything to them.","There's something that happens in that delivery room, when a woman becomes ten times more a woman, and a guy becomes six times less a man. You feel really dopey and useless and like a spectator. I did, anyway.","She kind of reminds one of Helen. There's something very similar about Elizabeth Perkins.","Nothing would make me happier if Peter Falk would finally win his Oscar for this. Not just as the writer but as a fan and a friend. It would be so great.","Not only do I sing to him, I sing entire conversations. You become Jerry Lewis.","It's not like some movies where you're following a bunch of different stories you can cut around. There was nowhere to cut to. It's these guys. We're not cutting back to anybody else.","In the original draft I was 27 and Peter was 55 in the script. That's not the same as a guy in his 40s and a dad in the end of his 70s. It's a different point in both our lives.","In fact, I had the idea because of Peter Falk. I saw my dad watching a Peter Falk movie and something clicked in my head. I gotta go make a movie for Peter Falk and me.","The biggest thing I remember is that there was just no transition. You hit the ground diapering.","I'd never directed before and this movie's too important to me to put in the hands of some guy who has never directed. Even if it's me.","I'd distract myself until finally it was a combination of things. The show was over and I had time on my hands. I had taken time and played and just relaxed.","I remember my wife and I used to get on plane and see everybody else with their babies. They'd be putting strollers and car seats up above, and we'd think: Oh, please Lord, don't make us go through that.","He was born early. But he was born within a safe range of premature.","Having a baby dragged me, kicking and screaming, from the world of self-absorption.","Every time I see Peter Falk in the movie I think that would be great. We'd be fun together.","But you get past that and realize you have to let go of what you think you want. There'll be plenty of time for that later. Right now, go and be with that baby. Just play with this beautiful little boy.","But the two of them together, broke my heart. Olympia and Peter, those scenes... When they're kissing in their 20s and then kissing in their 70s, that's what it is. And they had never met five minutes before they shot those scenes.","But I really felt that, something about the lights going down, and the sense of community. I saw this movie at one festival, and there were 1700 people.","And in that time, I lost my dad and had kids of my own. It was like, OK, I get it now. I know what fatherhood is all about. And you look at your parents differently."],"Paul Reubens":["But I don't know. Pee-wee just kind of popped out one day, pretty much fully fleshed-out and fully formed.","I probably have become more infamous from two misdemeanors than probably anyone I could think of.","Look at me, I'm getting defensive about something that happened so many years ago, somebody said. I'll have to find out who that was and if he's still alive.","The moment that I realized my name was going to be said in the same sentence as children and sex, that's really intense. That's something I knew from that very moment, whatever happens past that point, something's out there in the air that is really bad.","The public may think I'm weird. They may think I'm crazy or anything that anyone wants to think about me. That's all fine. As long as one of the things you're not thinking about me is that I'm a pedophile. Because that's not true.","I've always felt like a kid, and I still feel like a kid, and I've never had any problem tapping into my childhood, and my kid side.","I think my entire career path was determined for me when I was 6 years old, watching reruns of 'I Love Lucy' on TV and thinking about making people laugh.","I was Pee-wee Herman for so many years that it wasn't really a question that I didn't want to do other things.","The public already knows about me more than I ever wanted it to know.","I would love to be in Kansas."],"Paul Revere":["The British are coming. One if by land, two if by sea.","In Medford, I awaked the Captain of the Minute Men; & after that, I alarmed almost every house, till I got to Lexington.","In the Fall of 1774 & Winter of 1775, I was one of upwards of thirty, chiefly mechanics, who formed ourselves into a committee for the purpose of watching the movements of the British soldiers, and gaining every intelligence of the movements of the Tories."],"Paul Rhys":["I'm totally obsessed with Dickens, and 'Great Expectations' was one of the first book's I read when I was still in school in Porthcawl.","I've always just been more comfortable as an outsider."],"Paul Ricoeur":["If it is true that there is always more than one way of construing a text, it is not true that all interpretations are equal.","The narrative constructs the identity of the character, what can be called his or her narrative identity, in constructing that of the story told. It is the identity of the story that makes the identity of the character.","Narrative identity takes part in the story's movement, in the dialectic between order and disorder.","If the Resurrection is resurrection from the dead, all hope and freedom are in spite of death.","The logic of validation allows us to move between the two limits of dogmatism and skepticism.","It is always possible to argue against an interpretation, to confront interpretations, to arbitrate between them and to seek for an agreement, even if this agreement remains beyond our reach.","Man is this plural and collective unity in which the unity of destination and the differences of destinies are to be understood through each other.","Testimony demands to be interpreted because of the dialectic of meaning and event that traverses it.","Although there has always been a hermeneutic problem in Christianity, the hermeneutic question today seems to us a new one.","The Law is one aspect of a much more concrete and encompassing relation than the relation between commanding and obeying that characterizes the imperative.","Testimony gives something to be interpreted.","Hope, insofar as it is hope of resurrection, is the living contradiction of what it proceeds from and what is placed under the sign of the Cross and death.","The moral law commands us to make the highest possible good in a world the final object of all our conduct.","There has always been a hermeneutic problem in Christianity because Christianity proceeds from a proclamation.","On a cosmic scale, our life is insignificant, yet this brief period when we appear in the world is the time in which all meaningful questions arise.","The text is a limited field of possible constructions.","Wisdom finds its literary expression in wisdom literature.","But myth is something else than an explanation of the world, of history, and of destiny.","First, it is not unimportant that the legislative texts of the Old Testament are placed in the mouth of Moses and within the narrative framework of the sojourn at Sinai.","For my own part, I abandon the ethics of duty to the Hegelian critique with no regrets; it would appear to me, indeed, to have been correctly characterized by Hegel as an abstract thought, as a thought of understanding.","Myth expresses in terms of the world - that is, of the other world or the second world - the understanding that man has of himself in relation to the foundation and the limit of his existence.","Ordinary language carries with it conditions of meaning which it is easy to recognize by classifying the contexts in which the expression is employed in a meaningful manner.","So long as the New Testament served to decipher the Old, it was taken as an absolute norm.","Testimony should be a philosophical problem and not limited to legal or historical contexts where it refers to the account of a witness who reports what he has seen.","There is no shorter path for joining a neutral existential anthropology, according to philosophy, with the existential decision before God, according to the Bible.","This is perhaps the most profound meaning of the book of Job, the best example of wisdom.","What must be the nature of the world... if human beings are able to introduce changes into it?"],"Paul Robeson":["I do not hesitate one second to state clearly and unmistakably: I belong to the American resistance movement which fights against American imperialism, just as the resistance movement fought against Hitler.","Through the years I have received my share of recognition for efforts in the fields of sports, the arts, the struggle for full citizenship for the Negro people, labor's rights and the fight for peace.","Yes, peace can and must be won, to save the world from the terrible destruction of World War III.","As an artist I come to sing, but as a citizen, I will always speak for peace, and no one can silence me in this.","The Korean war has always been an unpopular war among the American people.","In Russia I felt for the first time like a full human being. No color prejudice like in Mississippi, no color prejudice like in Washington. It was the first time I felt like a human being.","In fact, because of this deep desire for peace, the ruling class leaders of this land, from 1945 on, stepped up the hysteria and propaganda to drive into American minds the false notion that danger threatened them from the East.","We must join with the tens of millions all over the world who see in peace our most sacred responsibility.","You want to shut up every Negro who has the courage to stand up and fight for the rights of his people, for the rights of workers, and I have been on many a picket line for the steelworkers too.","Why should the Negroes ever fight against the only nations of the world where racial discrimination is prohibited, and where the people can live freely? Never! I can assure you, they will never fight against either the Soviet Union or the peoples' democracies.","The other reason that I am here today, again from the State Department and from the court record of the court of appeals, is that when I am abroad I speak out against the injustices against the Negro people of this land.","But the deep desire for peace remained with the American people.","This is the basis, and I am not being tried for whether I am a Communist, I am being tried for fighting for the rights of my people, who are still second-class citizens in this United States of America.","And at home in the United States we found continued and increased persecution, first of leaders of the Communist Party, and then of all honest anti-fascists.","At every step the vast majority have expressed horror at the idea of an aggressive war.","Like any other people, like fathers, mothers, sons and daughters in every land, when the issue of peace or war has been put squarely to the American people, they have registered for peace.","And, gentlemen, they have not yet done so, and it is quite clear that no Americans, no people in the world probably, are going to war with the Soviet Union.","Could I say that the reason that I am here today, you know, from the mouth of the State Department itself, is: I should not be allowed to travel because I have struggled for years for the independence of the colonial peoples of Africa.","Four hundred million in India, and millions everywhere, have told you, precisely, that the colored people are not going to die for anybody: they are going to die for their independence.","I did a long concert tour in England and Denmark and Sweden, and I also sang for the Soviet people, one of the finest musical audiences in the world.","I know that if the peace movement takes its message boldly to the Negro people a powerful force can be secured in pursuit of the greatest goal of all mankind. And the same is true of labor and the great democratic sections of our population.","I said it was my feeling that the American people would struggle for peace, and that has since been underscored by the President of these United States.","My mother was born in your state, Mr. Walter, and my mother was a Quaker, and my ancestors in the time of Washington baked bread for George Washington's troops when they crossed the Delaware, and my own father was a slave.","This United States Government should go down to Mississippi and protect my people. That is what should happen.","You know I am an actor, and I have medals for diction."],"Paul Rodriguez":["Hunting is not a sport. In a sport, both sides should know they're in the game.","Animals don't have anyone to protect them.

If you don't laugh, you're not going to live long."],"Paul Rudd":["Looking back, I'm really happy with the choices I've made in my career. I know for a fact I could be wealthier. Who knows, maybe I could be more successful, maybe not. I don't know. But just about every single thing I've ever done I've gone into with the right intentions, and that goes a long way.","Puberty hit me pretty hard. All of a sudden, I woke up, and I had really curly hair.","I treasure laughs more than anything; they've helped me in life the most.","I think there's something great and generic about goldfish. They're everybody's first pet.","I'm not actively seeking stardom. I just go to auditions, and I knock on wood.","Nothing is ever cut-and-dried. There's anguish behind everything.","Anything traumatic in my life I've always dealt with through jokes and comedy.","Humor is the most important thing in life. It trumps everything else, and it's the only thing that helps me deal with everything else.","I love attempting to play real people. I like to try and have dramatic moments as well as comedic moments, and my favorite thing is when those two lines are blurred.","Anybody that's going on a road trip and doesn't really want to get into a myriad of snacks is probably no one you want to get in the car with.","I'm not good at small talk. I'm really not. I'm not that great at any talk.","Even more than getting married or having kids, I found losing a parent is what thrusts you into adulthood. For me it was. That was when the Earth tilted on its axis, and there was a paradigm shift, and I felt like a different person.","It's not often that you get to play somebody that has absolutely no cynicism or is not judgmental in any way.","I do like the idea that tomorrow I might find out that I'm going to be doing something that is completely unknowable today. I think it forces you to live in the moment in a very good way.","At my core, I'm a Midwesterner.","Willie Nelson is the perfect person, it seems to me, to think about. Because something tells me that he operates on his own frequency.","Tea has always been a big thing in my life. And I'm not talking about Liptons with lemon or iced tea, or any of that nonsense. Has to be hot PG Tips with milk.","I know a lot about the Titanic. My dad was a Titanic expert.","There are so many really good comedians, and I would never be as good as they are. It's not my calling.","Embarrassment and awkward situations are not foreign things to me.","I was never much into knights and sorcery and that kind of thing. It's not because I was into anything cooler. I certainly wasn't. I played with LEGOs. I played with LEGOs way past when most people played with LEGOs.","Kiss is a super - they are total businessmen. They pride themselves on it.","I'm, uh, not proud to say it - I play fantasy baseball. It's, like, the dorkiest thing ever.","There's a very specific thing you can do to get in magazines. I'm much happier to just show up and do the job. I haven't taken the active approach to making myself a star. I haven't been in a blockbuster.","It's insane but it's a great insane.","Theater is the most enriching and thrilling thing to do as an actor.","I can, and do, walk the street. No one bothers me or anything, because most people wouldn't know who I am.","I don't consider myself a comedian because I don't really concern myself too much with jokes.","I'm sure that my wanting to be an actor had to do with a need for approval.","My parents were married my whole life until my father passed away a few years ago.","If someone made fun of me, I'd be bummed out. But I'd play it like I thought it was hilarious.","Fear is what makes comedy funny.","Sometimes I think I'm funny. But then sometimes I see myself, and I think, 'There's somebody trying to be funny.'","I have trouble with long-term things. I tend to get obsessed with stuff and then move on. Roles, songs, video games. That's why I was afraid of marriage. Because it was like a lifelong game of 'Madden.'","I love straight guys that seem gay. I'm a little like that.","I wasn't one of those kids who was like, 'I want to be an actor.' It wasn't in my wheelhouse at all. I wasn't from a family that did this or in a place where people did this.","When I was in my early twenties, I used to grow all sorts of very weird beards. All of them awful in retrospect. I had Civil War beards for a while, then Mennonite beards.","Growing up, I was certainly drawn to comedy, but my goal was just to be as well-rounded an actor as possible. I really liked Daniel Day-Lewis, and I thought, 'Oh, he's a good guy to try and emulate.'","There's a lot of people I would be more than a little overwhelmed by and thrilled to work with.","I was always in new schools and had British parents, which was not the norm, and I think there was also... I'm not particularly religious, but I was born Jewish, and I always felt like the outsider because I wasn't Christian or Catholic.","There is something about growing up in the Midwest that gives a different kind of sensibility. But if I'm feeling insecure, the smiles and politeness get upped a notch, and maybe that isn't totally reflective of how I'm feeling on the inside.","I've hitchhiked - it is 'hitchhiked,' and not 'hitchedhike' like 'passersby,' right? - a couple of times, but only in emergency situations, and that's really the time that it's okay to hitchhike.","I think there's something kind of good about growing up in a place you know is not the cool place to be. I think it's good for your head.","I really tried for a while to go with the Adam Ant look.","'Anchorman' was never supposed to be a popular, like, hit movie. That movie was a cheap movie - it felt like we were working on a weird independent comedy in a way.","I think most marriages, mine included, you're constantly tending the garden, constantly working at it.","People have all different kinds of marriages. Whatever works for you.","Whatever I'm working on, the character I'm playing tends to slowly bleed into my own real life. Not in any kind of creepy, Method actor-y kind of way - it's just an innate kind of merging.","I laugh much more during takes than I do during real life. Maybe because you're not supposed to. I've ruined many takes because I will lose it.","I've been friends with Elizabeth Banks since 'Wet Hot American Summer.'","I don't have an agenda where I do a comedy and say, 'I have to do a drama next,' or 'I am looking for an action movie now.'","I always try and hold to that saying, 'I want to work on things I'd want to see.' The vast majority, that's been true.","I am so appreciative I have been able to continue not only doing something I love, but working on movies I've loved.","I would say, up until 'Anchorman,' I wasn't any kind of household name or anything, but I wasn't necessarily identified as much with being a comedian.","I'd like to do something dramatic or a different kind of role, but I tend not to separate comedy and drama all that much.","You can make a lot of mistakes with hair because it grows back.","I used to ask my mom to try and shave my head on the sides to give me a receding hairline because Adam Ant had one.","For a while, I tried to masquerade as somewhat of a hippie because I was under the impression that was the kind of guy girls would like. I was pretty unsuccessful because I liked the idea of camping more than actually camping. I did go to a Grateful Dead concert, but I was pretty bored.","In eighth grade, I wore a tie to school every day. I didn't own jeans. But it wasn't a granola thing, it was really more of an INXS thing.","I'm not that nice - it's one of those things that reveals itself over time. You could talk to people who know me well; they could give you a laundry list. Except they probably wouldn't because they're petrified.","I think I used comedy as a mechanism: if I could make the other kids laugh, I wouldn't get beaten up or teased as much.","While there are so many great things in my life, you get older, and you have responsibilities. And things happen, like my dad dying - things that are tough to shake off. And there are things I'm still trying to figure out.","I'm a huge David Wain fan. He's one of my best friends now, but he just makes me laugh continually, much to the annoyance of his wife.","There's something great about the idea of working the land and living communally. That's healthy. That's good.","Who knows what critics are thinking? I know that you make more of a name for yourself, make more of an interesting review, if you're kind of mean-spirited.","A lot of people say, 'What's the worst part about being an actor?' And the worst part is that you're not a musician.","Alex Smith is - I think he is a winner, and he's a smart quarterback, and I'm a fan of his.","I find many of the people that I've worked with to be incredibly funny.","I've always loved David Letterman. There was an irreverence to his show that I remember, especially in 'Late Night' - it always seemed so fresh.","I went to college and studied theater; I went to a theater conservatory. I live in New York because I wanted to do plays and still do plays.","Comedy-wise, I think Chris Elliott is one of the funniest people.","There is a major part of who I am that does not feel like the alpha male.","I don't feel like a dork, but I certainly have many moments of nerdism, and I embrace it wholeheartedly. I've always cottoned to that crowd more, anyway.","My sister was born a couple years after I was, and I realized that I wasn't getting enough attention, as much attention as I used to before she showed up, and then I learned pretty early on that if I could do a silly dance or make grown-ups laugh, then the attention would come back to me, and I would be accepted.","All I really wanted to be was a working actor.","I'm a big fan of not working.","I think Ellen DeGeneres is just hysterical.","My wife is very stealth-funny. She'll come out with something when I'm not expecting it, and it'll just kill me.","Growing up, if I had been given any advice - bad or good - I probably wouldn't have been able to act on it regardless. I wasn't shy, but I'd get nervous. I got a little more confident later in high school when I realized I could get girls to pay attention to me by making them laugh.","Amy Poehler, Amy Sedaris - they're both genius.","My bar mitzvah, I went to my nan's, and she made kugel.","Awkwardness is such a gold mine for comedy.","I went through a phase where I thought it was really funny to make pratfalls in very crowded places. I jumped out of a moving car once, for a laugh. That was a mistake.","I can talk about sports and stuff, but I have a season pass for 'Antiques Roadshow' on my TiVo.","Early on, I decided I would see if I could make a career work on my own terms.","I'm surprised that I get to be in the same room with half the people that I'm working with.","I used to live next door to a farm, so every day for awhile, I used to walk over and fed the cows, when I was in school. This was weird because I lived in sort of a subdivision, but this one holdout in our neighborhood in Kansas still had a farm.","'Divorce Court' is a great show.","Personally - and I don't mean to brag - my jokes have been falling flat for most of my life.","I hated 'Top Gun.'","There are many great writers out there and, actually, great scripts. The problem is - and this is what I've always felt, even when I got out of school and started reading scripts - the really smart, character-driven stuff tends to be smaller films, and they just don't get made.","It's nice to be in anything that anybody sees or likes. If it's something that has lasted, it's great.","People do still mention 'Clueless' to me. I'm proud and happy that I was in it.","To me, some of the funniest movies would be probably categorized in the dramatic genre, and likewise, some of the most dramatic films, or films that have the most dramatic moments, are in comedies.","'Ant-Man' was a genre, I guess, that I hadn't really tackled before.","Sometimes you read a script, and it's like, 'You'll improv, and this is just a blueprint of what the scene could be,' and that's never a good sign. And it's never encouraging as an actor to take that on, really.","I don't find the characters I've played funny. The characters are actually taking their situations very seriously.","My parents raised me to treat people the way you would want to be treated and to be polite. Sometimes, when I get nervous or insecure, I might overcompensate and might not be totally true to what I am feeling inside. But I get nervous and maybe too smiley and polite.","I grew up in the Midwest, where people seem to be friendly and nice to one another. There is less stress than in some of the other cities.","I've been naked in a lot of my movies. There's something inherently funny about the naked male body, particularly mine.","I grew up in a lot of different places, mostly in Kansas, I really started thinking seriously about acting in high school; I just did it better than most of the other activities in school.","I think that I identify with my role in pretty much everything I have tried to do. I try to find something that I can understand about each character's behavior.","What's weird is that anybody can write anything, and once it goes online, it's permanent. My very first biography on IMDb, which was written by a manager I had at the time, was not true.","I try not to think of myself in any category, and I don't ever really try to imagine myself competing with another actor. I just know I want to do the things that I would want to see, and I know the things that turn me on, whether it's on the stage, or it's a play or a film. I just kind of want to keep doing my own thing.","I used to love, love Steve Martin. I still do... I would get these albums, and I would just listen to them all the time. I would stand in my room and pretend that I was delivering his comedy routine... And I don't know if that planted any kind of seed, but I wasn't raised going to the theatre.","To try and sustain a performance is always a challenge. Anything you work on, to try and be real and show up and not look as if I'm playing pat to anything is always work.","My definitions of comedy, drama, and straight man are all blurry for me. I don't think of it in those terms.","The truth is, there are so many terrific places in New York because it's the greatest city in the world, and there are so many fascinating places to see that, frankly, it's humbling.","As a kid, I know that most of my parents' friends were because my mom made friends with them, and my dad went along. I know a lot of dads who do that. I think it just starts to happen with guys. In the case of my father, he was probably just too busy reading books about Titanic.","Why would anyone be an actor if he or she weren't insecure? That's why anybody pursues this kind of work."],"Paul Rust":["Being sincere and true to yourself is a scary thing but, ultimately, a rewarding one.","The thing that I like about Pee-wee is it can exist on the level of midnight college cult movies that the hip kids are into and, at the same time, it could be something a kid and his family watch together. Being able to straddle both lines of being subversive and, at the same time, very inclusive - I love that about the character.","I remember doing this little physical gesture of holding up my foot and having my foot wave around while I held my ankle. It got a big laugh, and when people started laughing, it dumped some chemicals on my brain. It just felt so good.","In real life, there are some times where a partner has cheated on somebody, and that person never found out about it. I have to imagine that that's happened before. It's a thing we don't really want to think about, because it's maybe the most painful thing to think about in a relationship - 'What if I've been cheated on and never knew?'","In real life, a relationship takes a long time. Either somebody is involved with somebody else, and that's ending, or somebody's hung up on an ex, or your job isn't going right, and so you're focused more on that than relationships. It just takes a lot for two people to get together.","Probably around junior high, I became obsessed with films.","I remember watching Quentin Tarantino accept an Academy Award for screenwriting for 'Pulp Fiction.' If I'd known then that 15 years later one of his movies would again be nominated for an Oscar and I'd be in it - that would be pretty crazy.","With Quentin Tarantino, he makes movies imagining himself as the audience. To be specific and true to what he wants resonates to people who like his movies.","It made me proud to know I'd join a long gallery of actors covered in blood in movies.","At one point, I just decided that it might be more creatively rewarding to put my time into writing on stuff that I could really be proud of rather than trying to get a one-episode part on 'Modern Family' or something.","If I'm not emotionally stable, should I put myself in a relationship? Because wouldn't that mean that I'm just using it as a distraction from my problems?","I come from standup and improv.","It's a lot of people's goal to be the lead in a movie, and that was never my goal. I just wanted to be the third banana in an ensemble comedy.","The thing that I get most excited about is that it does feel like a new realm of storytelling is being created before everybody's eyes. You can do something that's not exactly a movie and not exactly a TV show, something in between.","Things are constantly in flux and changing, and as crazy-making as that can be, it's also the thing that can get you through tough times - 'Well, things change.'","My sweet spot, the stuff I like the most, is hopeful melancholy. Optimistic melancholy.","'Cannonball Run II' - you watch that, and it looks like they're having a good time, but it's not necessarily a masterpiece.","Scott Aukerman and Judd Apatow are two people who I owe a lot to, and it's always great to work with Scott whenever I can.","I always liked the 'Mad Men' philosophy where people don't really change.","I'm married now, but I fell in love with my wife because she was talented. Talent - it's the big one.","I wrote on the fourth season of 'Arrested Development.'","If you read scripts, you would see people rarely speak like that in real life, in complete sentences.","I don't really like the term 'honest.'","Some people have interpreted the title of the show - 'Love' - as ironic. For me, it's sincere. The idea that we have to agree with love is a genuine statement about love.","It's tough - and I'm not the first person to say this - but cliches exist because they actually happen in real life.","Love takes a lot of work.","It's such a thrill in a relationship to be able to collaborate creatively. It's very romantic, and I like it.","Certainly on a date, I've been over-focused on, 'Is this person comfortable or not?' and then deciding for them that they are not comfortable and I will help them, which is death for a first date.","I'm sure that it's a universal experience, but I wonder if it gets exacerbated more in Los Angeles, where people are constantly looking over at the other people, going, 'Why don't I have that? I want that. Their table looks warmer.'","The first text I ever got was somebody breaking plans on a first date. That was, like, the worst way to be introduced to a new technology is with rejection.","I want to be liked. Everybody wants to be liked.","I was such a fan of Quentin's growing up. I remembered I wanted to see 'Pulp Fiction' so badly, but my mom had seen it, and even though she loved it, she just thought it wasn't appropriate for a 13-year-old.","My mom did this really cool thing: when 'Pulp Fiction' came out on video, she made, like, a 'mommy edit.' She took two VCRs and dubbed 'Pulp Fiction' from one tape to the next and edited out all the parts she thought were unsuitable for a kid. It was basically, like, the opening and ending credits.","Growing up in a small town, in the Midwest, and Catholic - those are sort of three layers of repression.","I think the desire to be funny was a mixture of wanting to be liked but also wanting to throw your elbows a bit.","I gotta say, the Catholic Church has churned out a lot of great artists and directors and actors, so if that's all they do, that's fine by me. If they're good at churning out tortured artists, that's great!","In your 20s, you're checking your bank account to make sure you're not broke. In your 30s, you're looking at yourself and realizing you're broken.","It would be easy for someone to think growing up in a small town would be like 'Footloose' or something, that it would be, 'No dancing allowed!' all the time, but it was quite the opposite. People always got excited for me and my successes and supported me even though I was a little weirdo goofball.","If you watch most of the stuff on TV and in movies, it's usually put-down humor. It's like somebody being mean or cynical or thoughtless to another person. I never wanted to be that type of comedian.","With so much of what I write, I'm just constantly wondering out loud, 'Do other people feel this way?'","Growing up in Iowa, there weren't many people who looked like me. And then when I moved out to L.A., every guy in comedy looked like me.","I want to give every single character the dimensions and complexity of a main character.","I would never turn down an invitation to co-write another Pee-wee Herman movie!","I grew up loving Pee-wee Herman. I was obsessed. I was the kid at school who everyone knew was obsessed with Pee-Wee.","A lot of the time, a comedy script is just dialogue, and that's the main thing you have to worry about.","Me and my comedy writer friends talk a lot about how we love 'Die Hard,' but we'll never be able to write 'Die Hard.'","Writing on 'Love' is so steeped in self-analysis. The writer's room can feel like therapy.","In high school, I was crazy in love, and I would make handmade construction paper valentines every month for our monthly anniversaries. Then I'd go early in the morning and tape one to her car. It sounds sweet, but let's be honest: it was a little weird. I was probably crossing some lines.","I don't believe in love at first sight.","Most relationships probably start with people going, 'Meh, it's probably best not to be embarking in this relationship.' We do it, though, because our brains are wired to make babies or whatever.","I love watching movies. That's, like, my favorite thing to do with friends.","I think it's sort of rare in TV shows or movies to see people being vulnerable. That's sort of scary to an audience.","Judd Apatow and Paul Reubens are two people who I'd be more than happy to learn from because I think they're geniuses at what they do.","I was going to go to a midnight screening of 'Pee-wee's Big Adventure' in college, and it's the sort of thing where people dress up. So I got dressed up, and then I got lost. I was speeding, and a cop pulled me over while I was wearing a Pee-wee suit. That's a hard ticket to get out of.","The first three times we met, I don't think I remembered anything. I was just in this daze like, 'Oh my gosh, I'm sitting here with Paul Reubens.' And I kept almost calling him Pee-wee.","The Magic Castle is not a place that people know nationally, but as soon as you move to L.A., you hear people talk about it.","It's been a challenge for me my whole life in that my insides don't necessarily match my outsides... People try to strike up a conversation with me about Dungeons & Dragons or comic books, and I'm like, 'I can't. I'm sorry.'","Every day, I thanked my lucky stars that I got to work with Gillian Jacobs, who is such an amazing actor and brings so much depth to everything that we do.","The challenge in writing a show that's about people and their flaws is that it can easily tip over - okay, I'll sometimes watch something, and there will be characters that are written in a way that I'll know that the writer just hates human beings. They're expressing this misanthropic point of view with these detestable characters.","Conflict comes from a person's own actions, not what someone else does to them.","It's funny; before I started writing professionally, I had a job logging video footage for behind-the-scenes footage for special features.","I watched 'Freaks and Geeks,' and I was like, 'Oh, if you write about your own personal experiences, and if you're specific about it both in what happened and how you felt about it, it can make for scenes that are really compelling.' For the rest of college, I was basically ripping off 'Freaks and Geeks' with plays I wrote and stuff like that.","The thing I always liked about 'Pee-wee's Big Adventure' was Pee-wee's, obviously, an oddball, but nobody in that universe points a finger at him and goes, 'Look at the weirdo!' I think that's why weirdo, arty kids like it so much: because it's sort of like a utopia.","I'm not the first person to talk about this, but L.A. is just sort of a weird city because it's just a bunch of little towns put together under the umbrella of L.A. So people feel disconnected from each other and far apart, and in a relationship, that can also be a thing.","I grew up in Le Mars, Iowa, and even though it's a great place to grow up and be raised as a kid, there wasn't a lot to do. It was fairly boring, and I think the way I either escaped the boredom or found a way to keep myself occupied was through movies and TV shows.","I came of age right around the time that the sort of priced-to-own VHS world began, and so the movies that you really enjoyed, you were able to kind of watch as many times as you wanted.","I try not to rely on pop culture references as a crutch for jokes, because then, I think, that's when the timelessness quality is lost.","I've noticed, as a comedy fan, that I really like Paul Thomas Anderson or Quentin Tarantino because when they're funny, they're actually funny. It's not like when other dramatic writers have comedy, and I'm just like, 'Well, that's not funny. Why are you even trying to make a joke here?'","I grew up in Iowa, so I would go hunting. I took a hunter's safety course in eighth grade to get extra credit in school."],"Paul Ryan":["Every successful individual knows that his or her achievement depends on a community of persons working together.","The secret to understanding me is, I'm not trying to be anybody other than who I actually am. People want candid, refreshing leadership. And I've always tried to go with solutions. You know, I've always tried to say, here's how we get our economy growing, here's why we get our debt under control. That's what Mitt Romney is offering.","Behind every small business, there's a story worth knowing. All the corner shops in our towns and cities, the restaurants, cleaners, gyms, hair salons, hardware stores - these didn't come out of nowhere.","The American people are ready for solutions, and Donald Trump offers a chance to move in a new direction.","If we don't make tough decisions today our children are going to have to make much, much tougher decisions tomorrow.","Everyone is equal. Everyone has a place. No one is written off, because there is worth and goodness in every life... That is the Republican ideal. And if we won't defend it, who will?","The reason I got involved in public service, by and large, if I had to credit one thinker, one person, it would be Ayn Rand. The fight we are in here, make no mistake about it, is a fight of individualism versus collectivism.","We will not duck the tough issues, we will lead.","We don't want to turn the safety net into a hammock that lulls able-bodied people into complacency and dependence.","Exploiting people's emotions of fear, envy and anxiety is not hope, it's not change, it's partisanship. We don't need partisanship. We don't need demagoguery, we need solutions.","Our debt is out of control. What was a fiscal challenge is now a fiscal crisis. We cannot deny it; instead we must, as Americans, confront it responsibly. And that is exactly what Republicans pledge to do.","Freedom of religion is a fundamental Constitutional principle. It's a founding principle of this country.","The debt and the deficit is just getting out of control, and the administration is still pumping through billions upon trillions of new spending. That does not grow the economy.","What I'm concerned about is endless borrowing, which is going to compromise our economy not only today but in the future. Because we know the decisions we make right now really dramatically impact us in the future, and the debt is literally getting out of our control.","We will not spend four years blaming others, we will take responsibility.","We believe, as our founders did, that 'the pursuit of happiness' depends upon individual liberty; and individual liberty requires limited government.","We need to stop spending money we don't have.","I'm going to speak my mind. I'm going to defend conservatism as I understand it. I'm going to defend our ideas as the Republican Party.","There is a consensus of willing leaders from both parties coalescing around the right way forward in health care. Reform should address government-imposed inequities and barriers to true choice and competition.","Free enterprise empowers entrepreneurs who have ideas and imagination, investors who take risks, and workers who hone their skills and offer their labor.","We are all representatives of the American people. We all do town hall meetings. We all talk to our constituents. And I've got to tell you, the American people are engaged. And if you think they want a government takeover of health care, I would respectfully submit you're not listening to them.","To my great disappointment, it appears that the politics of division are making a big comeback. Many Americans share my disappointment - especially those who were filled with great hope a few years ago, when then-Senator Obama announced his candidacy in Springfield, Illinois.","A free economy and strong communities honor the dignity of every person, rewarding effort with justice, promoting upward mobility, and building solidarity among citizens.","Hey, I'm a Catholic deer hunter, I am happy to be clinging to my guns and my religion.","What we need is a safety net that lifts people out of poverty - that helps them earn a good paycheck so they can support themselves.","The moral case for individual initiative in a free economy holds that people have a God-given right to use their creativity to produce things that improve our lives.","The rate of return on Social Security for people nearing retirement is about 1.5 percent. By the time young children like mine are ready to retire, that rate of return will be a negative percentage.","This is a government takeover of our healthcare system. It is the government basically running the entire healthcare system, turning large insurers into de facto public utilities, depriving people of choice, depriving people of options, raising people's prices, raising taxes when we need new jobs.","Some of our best and biggest allies in this struggle and fight against radical Islamic terror are Muslims, the vast, vast, vast majority of whom are people who believe in pluralism, freedom, democracy, individual rights.","We believe that the government has an important role to create the conditions that promote entrepreneurship, upward mobility, and individual responsibility.","We believe a renewed commitment to limited government will unshackle our economy and create millions of new jobs and opportunities for all people, of every background, to succeed and prosper. Under this approach, the spirit of initiative - not political clout - determines who succeeds.","We need to reclaim our American system of limited government, low taxes, reasonable regulations, and sound money, which has blessed us with unprecedented prosperity. And it has done more to help the poor than any other economic system ever designed.","We need leadership. We don't need a doubling down on the failed politics of the past.","Throughout human history, the American Idea has done more to help the poor than any other economic system ever designed.","Only by taking responsibility for oneself, to the greatest extent possible, can one ever be free, and only a free person can make responsible choices - between right and wrong, saving and spending, giving or taking.","When our opponents on the Left have no serious ideas of their own, they resort to emotional appeals that play up Americans' fears about the future.","In Pennsylvania, 38 percent of Pennsylvania seniors chose to get their Medicare from a plan called Medicare Advantage. It's their choice. Forty-seven percent of them are going to lose it under 'Obamacare' according to Medicare by 2017.","I call crony capitalism, where you take money from successful small businesses, spend it in Washington on favored industries, on favored individuals, picking winners and losers in the economy, that's not pro-growth economics. That's not entrepreneurial economics. That's not helping small businesses. That's cronyism, that's corporate welfare.","My Dad, a small-town lawyer, was also named Paul. Until we lost him when I was 16, he was a gentle presence in my life. I like to think he'd be proud of me and my sister and brothers, because I'm sure proud of him and of where I come from, Janesville, Wisconsin.","College graduates should not have to live out their 20s in their childhood bedrooms, staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life.","The work ahead will be hard. These times demand the best of us - all of us, but we can do this. Together, we can do this. We can get this country working again. We can get this economy growing again. We can make the safety net safe again. We can do this.","This is our job as leaders: to offer positive solutions and empower people. Our duty is to tackle our problems before they tackle us.","This is what life is like with the Clintons. It is one scandal after another, and you never know what's coming next. They use the system to enrich themselves.","I would sue any president that exceeds his or her powers.","In America, aren't we all supposed to see beyond class, see beyond ethnicity? Are all these lines drawn to set us apart and lock us into groups?","I learned a good deal about economics, and about America, from the author of the Reagan tax reforms - the great Jack Kemp. What gave Jack that incredible enthusiasm was his belief in the possibilities of free people, in the power of free enterprise and strong communities to overcome poverty and despair. We need that same optimism right now.","People like me who are reform-minded ignore the people who say, 'Just criticize and don't do anything and let's win by default.' That's ridiculous.","Conventional wisdom on government's role in inequality often has it backwards. Tax reforms have resulted in a more progressive federal income tax; government transfer payments have become less progressive.","Big-government economics breeds crony capitalism. It's corrupt, anything but neutral, and a barrier to broad participation in prosperity.","There are a lot of regulations that are really just crushing jobs. Look at the coal miners in the Rust Belt that are getting out of work. Look at the - look at the loggers and the timber workers and the paper mills in the West Coast. Look at the ranchers or farmers in the Midwest with regulations.","We do not have a functioning market in the true sense of the word in health care. That's a layer of transparency that's sorely needed in America.","If borrowing and spending all this money led to more jobs than we would be at full employment already.","Republicans have offered dozens of comprehensive healthcare plans many of which achieve comprehensive healthcare reform without breaking what's working in healthcare. We want to fix what's broken in healthcare.","Hiding spending does not reduce spending.","Our founders got it right when they wrote in the Declaration of Independence that our rights come from nature and nature's God, not from government.","Do we believe that the goal of government is to promote equal opportunity for all Americans to make the most of their lives? Or, do we now believe that government's role is to equalize the results of peoples lives?","I don't want to get into the 'who's a hostage-taker' discussion here, but what is the estate tax? It's a double tax on death. Economists will tell you that it's really not a tax that soaks the rich, but it's a tax on capital that deprives business investment and therefore job creation.","Look, only in Washington is not raising taxes considered a tax cut. Nobody's getting a tax cut here. We're not cutting taxes. We're preventing tax increases from occurring.","Are we interested in treating the symptoms of poverty and economic stagnation through income redistribution and class warfare, or do we want to go at the root causes of poverty and economic stagnation by promoting pro-growth policies that promote prosperity?","Since taking office, President Obama has signed into law spending increases of nearly 25 percent for domestic government agencies - an 84 percent increase when you include the failed stimulus. All of this new government spending was sold as 'investment.'","That's the real secret to job creation - not borrowing and spending more money in Washington.","What we heard today was not fiscal leadership from our Commander-in-Chief, what we heard today was a political broadside from our Campaigner-in-Chief.","By failing seriously to confront the most predicable economic crisis in our nation's history, the President's policies are committing us and our children to a diminished future.","We are looking for bipartisan solutions not partisan rhetoric.","Look, the president is elected to lead and to face the country's biggest challenges. The country's biggest challenge domestically speaking, no doubt about it, is a debt crisis, and I'm really hoping that he is going to give us a budget that tackles this debt crisis.","Borrowing and spending is not the way to prosperity.","Look, I am not worried about Washington cutting too much spending too fast. I mean, the kinds of spending cuts we're talking about just right now are $100 billion out of a $3.7 trillion budget.","If you're running for president, you've got to do a lot of things to line up a candidacy. I've not done any of those things. It's not my plan. My plan is to be a good chairman of the House Budget Committee and fight for the fiscal sanity of this nation.","We're saying no changes for Medicare for people above the age of 55. And in order to keep the promise to current seniors who've already retired and organized their lives around this program, you have to reform it for the next generation.","Look, of course people are scared of entitlement reform because every time you put entitlement reform out there, the other party uses it as a political weapon against you.","I don't consult polls to tell me what my principles are or what our policies should be.","Here's the problem if you keep raising tax rates: You slow down economic growth.","When you take a look at the problems our country is facing, debt is No. 1. The math is downright scary and the credit markets aren't going to keep on giving us cheap rates.","If we didn't propose these reforms, we would not have proposed a budget that got the debt under control.","This debt crisis coming to our country. The wall and tidal wave of debt that is befalling our nation. Medicare and Social Security go bankrupt within ten years, we have a debt that is looming so high that in the last year of President Obama's budget just the interest payments on our debt is $916 billion dollars.","What matters to me is that I do what I think is right and I see, I'm a numbers guy, that's my attitude. I know we have a debt tsunami coming, we are bankrupting this country and I'm in a position where I can actually advance ideas to prevent that from happening. That's exactly what I should be doing.","The perfection of our union, especially our commitment to equality of opportunity, has been a story of constant striving to live up to our Founding principles. This is what Abraham Lincoln meant when he said, 'In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free - honorable alike in what we give, and what we preserve.'","The belief that recipients of government aid are better off the more we spend on them is remarkably persistent. No matter how many times this central tenet of liberalism gets debunked, like Brett Favre, it just keeps coming back.","Activist government overreach and ongoing economic stagnation have shown us why Washington should not try to displace what is best left to civil society.","In government-directed economies, the collective takes priority over the individual. The moral ideal is equal results. That approach could not be further removed from the real world.","Obama is trying to paint us as a caricature, as if we're some bizarre individualists who are hardcore libertarians. It's a false dichotomy and intellectually lazy. Of course we believe in government. We think government should do what it does really well, but that it has limits.","I really don't have tremendous political ambition. I have policy ambition.","If somebody is going to try to paste a person's view on epistemology to me, then give me Thomas Aquinas. Don't give me Ayn Rand.","The President didn't offer any clarity in his latest speech about what he would do to tackle our nation's debt before it tackles us and it's still not clear how he'll keep Medicare from going bankrupt. One thing is clear though, Barack Obama isn't interested in governing or putting forward solutions to fix our nation's problems.","We wonder if we will be the first generation in American history to leave our children with fewer opportunities and a less prosperous nation than the one we inherited.","A bold reform agenda is our moral obligation. If we make the case effectively and win this November, then we will have the moral authority to enact the kind of fundamental reforms America has not seen since Ronald Reagan's first year.","We must solve the problem in health care by curbing out-of-control costs that erode paychecks for working families and push quality coverage out of reach for millions of Americans.","We must promote upward mobility, starting with solutions that speak to our broken education system, broken immigration policy, and broken safety-net programs that foster dependency instead of helping people get back on their feet.","While President Obama shirks his responsibility to advance solutions to our fiscal challenges, he can no longer hide from the merciless math of the balance sheet. Conservatives have made certain of that.","Class is not a fixed designation in this country. We are an upwardly mobile society with a lot of movement between income groups.","Every now and then, President Obama sorta drops his veil. He's less coy about his philosophy, he sort of reveals his true governing philosophy, what he really believes.","You're going to hear a lot from President Obama and yes, from Joe Biden, you're hearing a little bit about Medicare these days. What they will not tell you is they turned Medicare into a piggybank to fund 'Obamacare.' They took $716 billion dollars to pay for the 'Obamacare' program.","President Obama's reckless defense cuts that are hanging over our cloud, hanging over the horizon could put almost 44,000 jobs at stake right here in Pennsylvania. we are not going to let that happen. You know why? Because No. 1, national defense is the first priority of the federal government.","President Obama clearly cannot run on his record. All he's offering is more of the same. That's not good. Look at the economy. It's stagnating. And so, what they're now going to try and do is bring this campaign down to little things, distractions, distortions, smear, fear, anger, frustration.","Hope and change? We're not doing that anymore. They're doing attack and blame. And so, I just think people are going to see through this. They want real leadership. They want us to get this country on the right track.","That's what the Romney plan is all about, how to get jobs created, how to get this debt and deficit under control, how to revive small businesses so we can create jobs, and how to bring growth and opportunity to society instead of this class warfare, instead of speaking to people like they're stuck in some class or station in life.","So, in Europe, they're cutting people's retirement and health benefits. And that's what we want to avoid from happening. They're raising taxes, entering a recession. That's the kind of economic program that President Obama has put in place.","Mr. Chairman, delegates, and fellow citizens: I am honored by the support of this convention for vice president of the United States. I accept the duty to help lead our nation out of a jobs crisis and back to prosperity - and I know we can do this.","Millions of young Americans have graduated from college during the Obama presidency, ready to use their gifts and get moving in life. Half of them can't find the work they studied for, or any work at all. So here's the question: Without a change in leadership, why would the next four years be any different from the last four years?","President Obama was asked not long ago to reflect on any mistakes he might have made. He said, well, 'I haven't communicated enough.' He said his job is to 'tell a story to the American people' - as if that's the whole problem here? He needs to talk more, and we need to be better listeners?","What's missing is leadership in the White House. And the story that Barack Obama does tell, forever shifting blame to the last administration, is getting old. The man assumed office almost four years ago - isn't it about time he assumed responsibility?","Before the math and the momentum overwhelm us all, we are going to solve this nation's economic problems. And I'm going to level with you: We don't have that much time. But if we are serious, and smart, and we lead, we can do this.","Mom was 50 when my Dad died. She got on a bus every weekday for years, and rode 40 miles each morning to Madison. She earned a new degree and learned new skills to start her small business. It wasn't just a new livelihood. It was a new life.","And to this day, my Mom is my role model.","And if small businesspeople say they made it on their own, all they are saying is that nobody else worked seven days a week in their place. Nobody showed up in their place to open the door at five in the morning. Nobody did their thinking, and worrying, and sweating for them.","In a clean break from the Obama years, and frankly from the years before this president, we will keep federal spending at 20 percent of GDP, or less. That is enough. The choice is whether to put hard limits on economic growth, or hard limits on the size of government, and we choose to limit government.","Everyone who feels stuck in the Obama economy is right to focus on the here and now. And I hope you understand this too, if you're feeling left out or passed by: You have not failed, your leaders have failed you.","When I was waiting tables, washing dishes, or mowing lawns for money, I never thought of myself as stuck in some station in life. I was on my own path, my own journey, an American journey where I could think for myself, decide for myself, define happiness for myself.","That's what we do in this country. That's the American Dream. That's freedom, and I'll take it any day over the supervision and sanctimony of the central planners.","We will not try to replace our founding principles, we will reapply our founding principles.","When it comes to jobs, President Obama makes the Jimmy Carter years look like good old days. If we fired Jimmy Carter then, why would we rehire Barack Obama now?","I think its rather peculiar. It's not in keeping with our founding documents, our founding vision. But I'd guess you'd have to ask the Obama administration why they purged all this language from their platform. There sure is a lot of mention of government, so I guess I would put the onus on them to answer why they did all these purges of God.","Our two party platforms were emphatic about Jerusalem being the capital of Israel. For the Obama administration to remove this language from the Democratic Party platform drives a wedge into one of the few issues that our two parties agreed on.","I accept the calling of my generation to give our children the America that was given to us, with opportunity for the young and security for the old - and I know that we are ready.","I live on the same block where I grew up. We belong to the same parish where I was baptized. Janesville is that kind of place.","I have never seen opponents so silent about their record, and so desperate to keep their power.","When Governor Romney asked me to join the ticket, I said, 'Let's get this done' - and that is exactly, what we're going to do.","After four years of getting the run-around, America needs a turnaround, and the man for the job is Governor Mitt Romney.","So here's the question: Without a change in leadership, why would the next four years be any different from the last four years?","The stimulus was a case of political patronage, corporate welfare, and cronyism at their worst.","What did the taxpayers get out of the Obama stimulus? More debt. That money wasn't just spent and wasted - it was borrowed, spent, and wasted.","Obamacare comes to more than two thousand pages of rules, mandates, taxes, fees, and fines that have no place in a free country.","The president has declared that the debate over government-controlled health care is over. That will come as news to the millions of Americans who will elect Mitt Romney so we can repeal Obamacare.","And the biggest, coldest power play of all in Obamacare came at the expense of the elderly.","Seven hundred and sixteen billion dollars, funneled out of Medicare by President Obama. An obligation we have to our parents and grandparents is being sacrificed, all to pay for a new entitlement we didn't even ask for. The greatest threat to Medicare is Obamacare, and we're going to stop it.","Mitt Romney and I know the difference between protecting a program, and raiding it. Ladies and gentlemen, our nation needs this debate. We want this debate. We will win this debate.","We have a plan for a stronger middle class, with the goal of generating 12 million new jobs over the next four years.","President Obama is the kind of politician who puts promises on the record, and then calls that the record. But we are four years into this presidency. The issue is not the economy as Barack Obama inherited it, not the economy as he envisions it, but this economy as we are living it.","A Romney-Ryan administration will protect and strengthen Medicare, for my Mom's generation, for my generation, and for my kids and yours.","The greatest threat to Medicare is Obamacare, and we're going to stop it."],"Paul S. Kemp":["It's true that 'Lords of the Sith' has a lesbian character. Her orientation is a characteristic in the same way as is her brunette hair. It just fit with my conception of her.","The human mind has infinite capacity to rationalize, and evil characters just push that boundary a bit. Whatever they're doing, they think it makes sense to do it, and they think they have a good reason to do it. In short, they feel justified.","I suppose the textbook definition of an anti-hero is pretty straightforward - a protagonist who embodies not only heroic characteristics but also some characteristics typically deemed non-heroic, even villainous.","The anti-hero walks the morally gray path and constantly flirts with redemption, and that flirtation is just a blast to write.","I don't actually do anything special to get in the proper frame of mind for creepy/heinous scenes.","I always say that characters must drive plots, never the reverse. Writing about large-scale events creates the risk that the scope of the events themselves can overwhelm the characters. I emphatically do not want that. That was the only trepidation I felt when I started 'The Twilight War.'","My favorite class as an undergraduate was a political theory class on justice. Now, 'justice' is hardly a self-defining term, and much smarter men than I have developed various definitions over the centuries. The class put Plato at one end and Nietzsche at the other, and off we went.","For me, 'The Hobbit' is an object lesson in storytelling, both in terms of characterization and story structure. It is an exemplar of storytelling in that regard.","I'm a transactional lawyer, which involves a lot of negotiation. If nothing else, that's given me a good eye for human motivation and frequent case studies in peculiar psychological quirks. I think that's served me fairly well as a writer.","I don't do 'political correctness,' whatever that means. I write the stories I want to write, featuring the characters I want to feature. I don't touch demographic bases to appease this group or that. I write what I want. Full stop.","My favorite film is 'The Empire Strikes Back.' My writing, and my personal taste in movies and books, tends toward works with a darker tone, and 'Empire' fits that the best of all the movies.","Luke and Vader's light saber duel in 'Return of the Jedi' gives me chills every time. Even the still photo of the two of them in silhouette, sabers crossed, gives me a rush.","I think my best quality as a writer is the ability to craft complicated, nuanced, interesting characters."],"Paul Sabatier":["Theories cannot claim to be indestructible. They are only the plough which the ploughman uses to draw his furrow and which he has every right to discard for another one, of improved design, after the harvest.","My own ideas on the mechanism of catalytic phenomena were very different from those at one time commonly held, ideas which I no doubt owed to the influence of the illustrious teacher who had guided my first steps in chemistry nearly twenty years before - I refer, of course, to Berthelot.","During the period 1901 to 1905, together with Senderens, I showed that nickel is very suitable for the direct hydrogenation of nitriles into amines and, no less important, of aldehydes and acetones into corresponding alcohols."],"Paul Sadler":["I went to Washington several times at the request of different parties to talk about education reform. I used to always say I felt like I needed to take a shower after I left, because it was so partisan that I just really hated it.","Ultimately, you change the culture in Washington only one way, and it's one election at a time, with the character of the people you send.","Like most Americans, I feel disgusted when we see people make decisions based on party politics rather than a solution that is best for the country.","The truth is we need to build an economy going forward with all of us, when we all move forward and the payment of a national debt is not the responsibility of one group of Americans versus another.","Some candidates can sit in an office for 10 hours a day asking for money. That's just not who I am."],"Paul Samuelson":["What we know about the global financial crisis is that we don't know very much.","Economics is a choice between alternatives all the time. Those are the trade-offs.","Investing should be more like watching paint dry or watching grass grow. If you want excitement, take $800 and go to Las Vegas.","Politicians like to tell people what they want to hear - and what they want to hear is what won't happen.","To a person of analytical ability, perceptive enough to realise that mathematical equipment was a powerful sword in economics, the world of economics was his or her oyster in 1935. The terrain was strewn with beautiful theorems begging to be picked up and arranged in unified order.","The contrafactual history is what it would have been the other way. Think of the Kennedy triumph in the missiles crisis. Worked out fine. Khrushchev blinked and so forth. The other road, you don't want to think too hard about. You could have had nuclear missiles wiping out a tenth of the globe.","Good questions outrank easy answers.","It is indeed true that the stock market can forecast the business cycle.","I think that it's more important for an economist to be wise and sophisticated in scientific method than it is for a physicist because with controlled laboratory experiments possible, they practically guide you; you couldn't go astray. Whereas in economics, by dogma and misunderstanding, you can go very sadly astray.","Every good cause is worth some inefficiency.","One of the pleasing things about science is that we do all climb towards the heavens on the shoulders of our predecessors. Economics, like physics, has its heroes, and the letter 'H' that I used in my mathematical equations was not there to honor Sir William Hamilton, but rather Harold Hotelling.","I did not throw out my education lightly, but what I was being taught was of no use in explaining what I saw around me. It was the Great Depression.","Avoiding inflation is not an absolute imperative but rather is one of a number of conflicting goals that we must pursue and that we may often have to compromise.","You're not making a decision if you come to a fork in the road. There is no 'it' to take. It's one or the other.","Today we see how utterly mistaken was the Milton Friedman notion that a market system can regulate itself... Everyone understands now, on the contrary, that there can be no solution without government.","Globalization presumes sustained economic growth. Otherwise, the process loses its economic benefits and political support.","The Keynesian idea is once again accepted that fiscal policy and deficit spending has a major role to play in guiding a market economy. I wish Friedman were still alive so he could witness how his extremism led to the defeat of his own ideas.","Women are men without money.","I'm not speaking in favor of killing innovation. I'm speaking in favor of centrist use of the market, which involves necessarily a considerable degree of regulation. Markets by themselves will get themselves inevitably into inequality and into their own destruction. It will happen again and again.","Economics has never been a science - and it is even less now than a few years ago.","An intriguing paradox of the 1990s is that it isn't called a decade of greed.","Self-deception ultimately explains Japan's plight. The Japanese have never accepted that change is in their interest - and not merely a response to U.S. criticism.","In well-functioning markets, price equals opportunity cost. Meaning that the proper way to price out and charge us for things is to charge us what those resources could otherwise have produced. This is a lesson the Soviet Union never learned at all, and the rest is history.","There's nothing in Keynesian economics that would allow you to solve stagflation. But there's nothing in neoclassical economics that would allow you to solve stagflation, either.","I believe, in the stock market - that's one of my fields - that most people are irrational. And to be irrational, you can be irrational in so many different ways that, practically, the result is indeterminate.","When I was a kid, I reckoned things in Hershey bars. Is this worth three Hershey bars to me?","Economics is not an exact science. It's a combination of an art and elements of science. And that's almost the first and last lesson to be learned about economics: that in my judgment, we are not converging toward exactitude, but we're improving our data bases and our ways of reasoning about them.","I can tell you, because I serve on so many nonprofit boards - where half of us are academics and half of us are from Wall Street - that there's no CEO who understands at all a derivative. All they know is that somebody tells them in their organization, 'We've got a wonderful profit center.'","People have the wrong idea that God will forgive Reagan. They say he didn't know what he was doing. It's true he didn't know a lot of what was going on, but he was directly responsible.","The very name of my subject, economics, suggests economizing or maximizing. But Political Economy has gone a long way beyond home economics.","Often, when I became a consultant to a federal agency, that precipitated its demise.","The problem is no longer that with every pair of hands that comes into the world there comes a hungry stomach. Rather it is that, attached to those hands are sharp elbows.","Companies are not charitable enterprises: They hire workers to make profits. In the United States, this logic still works. In Europe, it hardly does.","Sooner or later the Internet will become profitable. It's an old story played before by canals, railroads and automobiles.","Asia's governments come in two broad varieties: young, fragile democracies - and older, fragile authoritarian regimes.","Funeral by funeral, theory advances.","It is not easy to get rich in Las Vegas, at Churchill Downs, or at the local Merrill Lynch office.","Milton Friedman. Friedman had a solid MV = PQ doctrine from which he deviated very little all his life. By the way, he's about as smart a guy as you'll meet. He's as persuasive as you hope not to meet.","My family was well off but not rich. I spent the four years I was an undergraduate working on the beach. And it wasn't because I was lazy; it was because my freshman class would go to a hundred different employers and wouldn't get a nibble. That was a disequilibrium system. I realized that the ordinary old-fashioned Euclidean geometry didn't apply.","I came to the University of Chicago on the morning of January 2, 1932. I wasn't yet a graduate of high school for another few months. And that was about the low point of the Herbert Hoover/Andrew Mellon phase after October of 1929. That's quite a number of years to have inaction.","Things swept so badly that I had distrust - after 1967, let's say - of American Keynesianism. For better or worse, U.S. Keynesianism was so far ahead of where it started. I am a cafeteria Keynesian.","'There are no easy pickings.' That would be a more accurate, less dramatic statement than 'There's no such thing as a free lunch.'","Time is our ultimate scarcity. Isaac Newton can give us more electricity, but he can't give us more than 24 hours of the day of time. And so we're constantly having to sacrifice alternate activities to get the one that pleases us most.","Keynes's contribution was not just to advocate spending government money in the middle of a recession. Every government had done that going back to the days of the Irish potato famine. What he gave to us was a way of thinking about the magnitude and the dimensions and so forth.","In 1936, money had no important role. Interest rates were one-eighth of one-eighth of one per cent. I did some research, and I found that the interest on one million dollars of ninety-day Treasuries was $37. People didn't even bother to collect it. The Fed wasn't important.","It is dead wrong about necessary surplus of winnings over losings.","The remarkable fact is not how much government does to control economic activity, but how much it does not do.","In this age of specialization, I sometimes think of myself as the last 'generalist' in economics, with interests that range from mathematical economics down to current financial journalism. My real interests are research and teaching.","The history of the twentieth century - America's century! - has been pretty much a history of rising prices.","Let those who will - write the nation's laws - if I can write its textbooks.","I can't think of a president who has been overburdened by a knowledge of economics.","U.S. capital formation, which has been pretty high in the '90s and very high in the late 1990s, is what is being financed by the savings of the rest of the world, generally poorer than ourselves, because our deficit on current account, chronic deficit, is their surplus, and they have been willingly bringing that to the American market.","We've become a debtor nation. I don't mean just on fixed-loan terms, but we own increasingly less abroad than is owned from abroad here.","Rent control created deadweight loss.","A temporary reduction in tax rates on individual incomes can be a powerful weapon against recession.","I think economics - and this is what I've tried to impart - has a tremendous amount of human interest in it.","Actually, in my advanced, high-falutin' frontier economics, I often work with what I define as 'money metric utility,' and I ask people, 'Do you really want that? What are you willing to pay for that?'","The Malthusian Theory - that mankind, for biological and sociological reasons, is so fertile, so fecund, that if you started out with the new continent and plenty of land for everybody, in several generations we would multiply our numbers.","Charles Darwin got his theory, his notion of natural selection, evolution, and so did its independent discoverer, Alfred Wallace, from reading Malthus.","The parts of physics that are exact are the parts of physics that are exact. The parts that are inexact are vastly greater. Sensible scientists don't waste their time pushing against doors that endlessly will not give. They are opportunistic and go where they can, but there are pitfalls in that.","My belief is that nothing that can be expressed by mathematics cannot be expressed by careful use of literary words.","What I say is, 'If you're so rich, how come you're so dumb?'","American society was economically ill-run in the 1980s. Our society has been on a consumption binge. If the American people had a town meeting and said, 'What do we care about posterity? Posterity hasn't done anything for us; we're going to whoop it up now,' that is a rational judgment. But nobody ever did that.","People had J.F.K. all wrong. They thought of him as a dashing, deciding type. He was an extremely hesitant person who checked the ice in front of him all the time.","I decided that there was only one place to make money in the mutual fund business, as there is only one place for a temperate man to be in a saloon: behind the bar and not in front of it.","Investing should be dull. It shouldn't be exciting.","The dream of any scholar has, for me, come true by virtue of this award. The Nobel Prizes are justly famous in the hard sciences, in literature, and for peace.","In the jargon of American vaudeville, Professors Frisch and Tinbergen are a 'hard act to follow.' But then, all my life, I have been following such great scholars and policy advisors as these.","Let me acknowledge that I realize that, in honoring me, the Committee of the Royal Academy of Sciences is in fact saying a good word for all of those of my generation who have been laboring in the same vineyard.","What is it that the scientist finds useful in being able to relate a positive description of behavior to the solution of a maximizing problem? That is what a good deal of my own early work was about.","I have not been able in one lecture even to scratch the surface of the role of maximum principles in analytic economics."],"Paul Sarbanes":["Where anti-Semitism persists, the well being of all our people is at risk.","Students of American history will recall that the important place where work gets done in the legislative body, almost without exception, is in the committees, more so than on the floor although sometimes more attention is paid to the floor.","America's Older Americans add great value to our Nation.","Furthermore, and a point I really want to make very strongly, is that this is the first Administration since Herbert Hoover not to create a net gain in jobs in the course of its Administration.","I was very concerned that President Bush is still trying to frighten or scare the American people with respect to the condition of the Social Security system.","That is what has happened to the United States in the international economic scene. We have deteriorated into a debtor status so that we are now dependent upon the kindness of strangers. That is not where the world's leading power should find itself.","We are confronting a situation in which the Administration, in my view, is once again manufacturing a crisis. There is no crisis in the Social Security system. The system is not on the verge of bankruptcy.","The administration in my view is once again manufacturing a crisis. There is no crisis in the Social Security system. The system is not on the verge of bankruptcy."],"Paul Scheer":["FX does a great thing with its comedies where they give them a slow push out there.","You're only as good as your body of work.","My background is in improv and writing.","The Internet is just a chance to do something. Nowhere else can you go, 'I have an idea, I can write this idea, and I can execute this idea.'","Kiefer Sutherland is a crazy jerk on '24,' but you love him because he gets the job done. And I think that that goes for a lot of action stars, I mean Steven Segal is a jerk, but you want to watch him because, eventually, he's a jerk who can beat up bad people.","It's funny to think of Dave Chappelle's show and how popular it was and he was before YouTube. I would imagine 'Chappelle's Show' would be even more giant if there was a chance to put his stuff online and pass it around.","I love that experience of seeing a bad movie or a movie that you don't even know, and then experiencing it with your friend.","I saw every single movie when I was a kid.","The most frustrating part of working in TV and film is that you have to convince someone to let you make what you want; in comics you can do whatever you want and for 1% of the budget of TV and film.","I'm married, and my wife has set out very limited Xbox limits. But if I had my druthers, I'd be playing all the time and never see any of my friends or do any work.","Adult Swim has cornered this really cool market, especially for comedy shows.","Summer movies are all about things blowing up and you going, 'Yeah!'"],"Paul Schneider":["I feel strongly about showing up and being prepared and not taking the opportunity for granted and being conscientious about my fellow co-workers.","What the entertainment industry can do is tempt you into making stupid mistakes, but the only tool that they have to tempt you is money. So if you're okay saying no to money, then you can say no to a lot of things that you might be embarrassed of later.","I come from a really lovely, really smart family where the only stress was money and employment.","I was really affected by 'The Piano.' Had I not seen that movie, I wouldn't have gone to film school.","When I do a job, I do it 100 percent. I am so grateful for the chance to do what I do.","I didn't grow up wanting to be an actor, and I didn't go to acting school.","If I ever stop acting, I'd like to be the author of that decision."],"Paul Schrader":["People who act against their own best interests are interesting characters.","I still think like a critic, and I still analyze films like a critic. However, it's not possible to write criticism if you're making films.","Those artists who say that somehow therapy or analysis will thwart their creativity are completely misinformed. It's absolutely the opposite: it opens closed doors.","Ultimately, it's an illusion that you can understand yourself.","I want to be happy; why do I do things that make me unhappy?","If you write interesting roles, you get interesting people to play them. If you write roles that are full of nuance and contradiction and have interesting dialog, actors are drawn to that.","As screenwriters, we struggle with our own success. We have wallpapered our world and now we can't get anyone to notice the picture we just hung.","I was raised as a Calvinist, which is doctrine-driven. And though there are many things wrong with Calvinism, you are at least encouraged to argue about things.","'Taxi Driver' wasn't autobiographical in terms of the actual events, but I did draw on my own mental state.","I teach a course in screenwriting at Columbia, but I've never taken a course and I've never read a book about it!","The only economic paradigm that movies have ever known is capitalism. There were no church sponsors or state patronage. The idea was that if you'd pay to see it, we'll make it for you."],"Paul Scofield":["A painting means as much to you as a string of pearls to an ape.","Cheating on a quiz show? That's sort of like plagiarizing a comic strip.","A book is worth a few francs; we Germans can afford to destroy those. We all may not appreciate artistic merit, but cash value is another matter.","What these books have conclusively proven is that the diffence between men and women is exactly 38 pages.","If you look around the table and you can't tell who the sucker is, it's you.","Sixty-four thousand dollars for a question, I hope they are asking you the meaning of life.","I should in fairness add that my taste in music is reputedly deplorable."],"Paul Scott":["The past becomes a texture, an ambience to our present.","Ah, well, the truth is always one thing, but in a way it's the other thing, the gossip, that counts. It shows where people's hearts lie.","We need to be able to go to school and feel safe and accepted for who we are."],"Paul Shaffer":["When you look into the eyes of an animal you've rescued, you can't help but fall in love.","Everybody should have a shelter dog. It's good for the soul.","I love to be the center of attention. My oversized ego craves it and needs it.","You've got to be a really straight man to write a song like 'It's Raining Men.'","Why would you want to do anything else but rescue a pet?","When I discovered that I could tune into American radio stations after dark, this was the hippest thing to me. It sort of saved my life.","The Dave Clark Five had more appearances on 'The Ed Sullivan Show' than The Beatles.","The record business has always mystified me. Sometimes there are reasons why things sell or don't sell that can't be understood by mere mortals.","I think of all the things that I've gotten to do, all the wonderful people that I've played with, being in the recording studio with Phil Spector tops them all. And of course, now he is in prison. I hope to visit him, I still consider him a friend, and what can you say? A terrible way for a guy like that to be remembered.","I've never had a plan for the future.","Not only was it enough to be a cover band, it was perhaps the highest calling. After all, if you could play music recorded by others, stay true to the original, and still add fire and flare, why not?","I don't know why this concept of what is hip became so important to me.","Life is nutty; anything can happen.","Writing never had the immediate gratification I was looking for.","I want to learn to sight-read music. And to play the bass pedals on the organ. Those are my only ambitions.","I actually met Deadmau5 for the first time on the red carpet in Hollywood for the Grammys. I was there with my daughter, and he introduced himself to me. He said, 'Hey, I'm from Toronto.' I had a little conversation with him, and then I realized I'm talking to a guy with a giant mouse head.","When Marty Short and I get together, I sit down at the piano and play the score of 'Godspell.'","I lived at the Gramercy Park Hotel for about 10 years. It was terrific. It was a pleasantly run-down hotel of the '70s and '80s with a mix of older, rent-controlled apartment dwellers, Europeans and new wave and punk bands. The room service was great, the hamburger was terrific, and they had a doctor who made house calls.","As far as favorite 'overall package' record of all time, I'd have to say 'My Girl' by The Temptations. I like everything about it, not only the composition - but the arrangement, the production, the lead vocals, the background vocals, the horns, the strings. That one I listen to over and over again.","I still talk incessantly about 'SCTV,' and I say, 'Screw the kids!'","I love funny people. I met and became friends with some of the funniest people ever. Gilda Radner, bless her soul; Martin Short; Dave Thomas; Eugene Levy.","I love to do comedy, but music is really my heart.","James Brown was my favorite, my absolute idol. Every time I played with him was like a music lesson, and I never thought I could be so funky! I mean, a white boy from Canada - a Jew - getting down with his funky bad self!","I'm doing less than I used to because I'm a family man now, and I have two kids.","My years on 'SNL' had reconfirmed that what I do best is play for a sort of edgy comedy."],"Paul Signac":["The golden age has not passed; it lies in the future.","The anarchist painter is not the one who will create anarchist pictures, but the one who will fight with all his individuality against official conventions."],"Paul Simon":["There's something about the sound of a train that's very romantic and nostalgic and hopeful.","I was eating in a Chinese restaurant downtown. There was a dish called Mother and Child Reunion. It's chicken and eggs. And I said, I gotta use that one.","Anybody can do bad work, but not everybody does good work.","Someone told me it's all happening at the zoo.","Music is forever; music should grow and mature with you, following you right on up until you die.","I question what emotion Manilow touches. People are entertained by him. But are they emotionally moved? I don't believe anything that Barry Manilow sings.","As long as you have capital punishment there is no guarantee that innocent people won't be put to death.","The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenements halls and whispered in the sounds of silence.","We've survived by believing our life is going to get better.","People often called us perfectionists, but we were not looking for perfection. We were looking for some kind of magic in the music.","Who am I to blow against the wind?","You want to be a writer, don't know how or when? Find a quiet place, use a humble pen.","I try to open up my heart as much as I can and keep a real keen eye out that I don't get sentimental. I think we're all afraid to reveal our hearts. It's not at all in fashion.","Improvisation is too good to leave to chance.","It's pointless to be critical of your stuff once it's done. I don't spend a lot of time agonising over it. It's of no importance once it's finished.","I'm more interested in what I discover than what I invent.","A man sees what he wants to see, And disregards the rest.","Listen to the sound of silence.","The thought that life could be better is woven indelibly into our hearts and our brains.","My whole artistic life has always been about change, change, change, move on, move on. It's the only thing I find interesting.","All lies and jests, still a man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest.","Why am I so soft in the middle when the rest of my life is so hard?","Faith is an island in the setting sun, But proof is the bottom line for everyone.","One of the things that upset me was some of the criticism leveled at Simon and Garfunkel. I always took exception to it, but actually I agree with a lot of it.","I suppose an artist takes the elements of his life and rearranges them and then has them perceived by others as though they were the elements of their lives.","I don't believe what the papers are saying They're just out to capture my dime, Exaggerating this, exaggerating that.","When I was 15, I made a solo record. It made Artie very unhappy. He looked upon it as something of a betrayal.","If you can get humor and seriousness at the same time, you've created a special little thing, and that's what I'm looking for, because if you get pompous, you lose everything.","Without Arthur's voice, I never would have enjoyed that success.","When we came into the studio I became more and more me, making the tracks and choosing the musicians, partly because a great deal of the time during Bridge, Artie wasn't there.","When I began making my own albums, the songs became funkier. They were more about the streets.","We were always able to sing and blend well together; that's our gift. But aside from that, we're really two different guys.","We just did what we'd done when we were an act in the '60s. But I found it impossible to hold a dialogue with 500,000 people. In a certain sense, it was numbing.","We had many more points of agreement than we had points of difference, but we did differ, and the bigger we got, the more insistent we got that each one of us should have his way.","We got on American Bandstand, where kids would dance to a record and then rate it. We called ourselves Tom and Jerry. I was Jerry.","The record company stay out of my way. Whenever the record is finished, they take it.","Not every song I write is ecstasy. And it can happen only one time. After that, when you sing the same melody and words, it's pleasure, but you don't get wiped out.","My voice is my improvisational instrument, the melody instrument. The guitar is harmonic structure. I'm not a good enough guitarist to improvise on it.","Mrs. Robinson is a little dated now, but it has nothing to do with Joe DiMaggio.","It's a big error to think that because you like somebody's work, you're going to like him.","I'm not in it for the money. I like music. I love to write music. I can't imagine myself not playing or singing or writing. It would just drive me crazy if I didn't.","I would be willing to do almost anything to make Art happy. I care about our friendship. The only thing I won't do is change the essence of my work.","I think I have a superior brain and an inferior stature, if you really want to get brutal about it.","I think Bridge Over Troubled Water was a very good song. Artie sang it beautifully. The Boxer was a really nice record. But I don't think I've written any great songs.","I rate each album as better than the last one. That's how I see it.","I lived in an attached house. My father used to drive into the wrong driveway all the time. He'd say, Damn it, how do you tell one of these houses from another?","I don't very often think I've done a good job. I don't like the majority of what I do. I shouldn't say I don't like it, but I'm not satisfied with almost everything that I do.","I don't think that Simon and Garfunkel as a live act compares to Simon and Garfunkel as a studio act.","I don't like fashion. It's very heartless.","I don't feel any pressure from fans. But I'm always in some kind of state of emotional turmoil. I would not describe myself as happy-go-lucky. That's not to say that I'm not happy.","I don't consider myself to be a major talent, so the only solace I can take is to hope I'm growing.","I always get very calm with baseball.","How much can you do with two voices? You can sing thirds or you can sing fifths or you can do a background harmony.","Having a track record to live up to and the history of successes had become a hindrance. It becomes harder to break out of what people expect you to do.","Facts can be turned into art if one is artful enough.","Being an artist doesn't mean that you're a good artist. That was the bargain I first made with myself: I'd say, I'm an artist, but I'm not really very good.","Artie travels all the time. The rehearsals were just miserable. Artie and I fought all the time. He didn't want to do the show with my band; he just wanted me on acoustic guitar.","Artie is a singer, and I'm a writer and player and a singer. We didn't work together on a creative level and prepare the songs. I did that.","There must be 50 ways to leave your lover.","My life so common it disappears and sometimes even music cannot substitute for tears."],"Paul Simonon":["I never wanted to go back and relive the glory days; I just want to keep moving forward. That's what I took from punk. Keep going. Don't look back.","Obviously, a bass sounds like a bass and a guitar sounds like a guitar, but the way you play the guitar reflects your personality.","I'm not knocking conceptual art; it's another department, but it doesn't move me like painting.","It would be obvious for me to do conceptual art, and I think I've done it already with smashing bass guitars and whatever - I consider that as conceptual.","I obviously had my reggae, but I got quite into rockabilly when I was a kid, because I was trying to find something that represented me as a white person.","Seven years without a break really takes a toll on you, and you don't even realize it. You're affected by other people, and after a while, sometimes they have love for you, and sometimes they don't.","I grew up wanting to be a painter and paint pictures.","We were starting to lose track with Earth because fame and success brings you many things that you're not really prepared for or know how to deal with as a human being.","There was a point after the whole intensity of the Clash finally subsided when I just found that painting grounded me in a way that music didn't.","I love putting paint on canvas, getting lost in the process of painting.","Being outside on your own in all weathers is exciting; it clears you out."],"Paul Singer":["In the workplace, employees should be judged on their merit and hard work and not on aspects that are irrelevant to their performance.","Successful hedge funds will be entrepreneurial; it is the essence of the craft.","Individual liberty, the basic underpinning of American society, requires constant defense against the encroachment of the state.","The building block of every community is family.","Resentment is not morally superior to earning money.","A great deal of stupidity has chipped away at the massive advantages of Western civilization, which could terminally decline if it remains on the current path. But these problems can be solved - and swiftly - if the right leaders emerge.","Credit ratings and risk weightings must undergo a thorough process of review and revision. No security or instrument on the planet should have a zero risk weighting.","You have got to welcome and embrace complexity.","'Inequality' has become the political theme/slogan of our time in both Europe and the U.S., yet political leaders do not even bother to consider that their own policies, which put the entire burden on central bankers to print money and drive up stock, bond and other asset prices, are actually exacerbating income and wealth disparity.","The starting point of my career in money management in 1973-74 was the time of the only true bear market any living non-Japanese investor has seen in major markets. Equities, real estate, you name it, everyone got run over.","While many of Mr. Obama's ideas warrant skepticism, conservative opposition to any expanded role for government is a mistake.","Today, even small entities that trade complex instruments or are granted sufficient leverage can threaten the global financial system.","It's true that monetary policy was too lax for too long, and the government encouraged lending to people who were unlikely to repay their loans.","Creating a regulatory system that reflects the modern-day realities of financial markets is not as difficult as it may appear.","The Orderly Liquidation Authority prescribed by Dodd-Frank should be repealed and replaced by an amendment to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code which would operate to prevent cross-default provisions from impacting derivatives books so long as mark-to-market payments are being made in a timely fashion.","Governments need to be authorized to provide 'open bank assistance.' The convolutions of Dodd-Frank aimed at 'avoiding' this tactic are ludicrous and will prove to be extremely costly to the system.","Derivatives trading should be standardized and as much as possible moved to clearinghouses.","I know people who are always freeriders and will never get into a fight.","The Congo is very wealthy from oil money but is not paying its debts and at the same time is applying for special status at the World Bank. That's shocking and disingenuous.","There is no more reason to believe that Bitcoin will stand the test of time than that governments will protect the value of government-created money, although Bitcoin is newer, and we always look at babies with hope.","If you want an alternative currency, check out gold. It has stood the test of thousands of years as a store of value and medium of exchange.","Stability is not the way of the world.","In government, the forces of risk-aversion and constant conflict serve to stultify and narrow the range of ideas up for debate.","What would a loss of confidence in the dollar actually look like? Gold going absolutely nuts.","Securing for gays and lesbians the basic right to have their relationships and families recognized as part of a community makes all of our communities stronger.","America is a place where the freedom to be who you are shouldn't be a barrier to your ability to get a job and provide for your family.","Given the typical fee structures of hedge funds, they need to do something different to make money in a consistent way.","It is a very bad idea for governments to create arbitrary and unfair outcomes, or outcomes resulting from the passions and whims of the government rather than from the law, just because they have the power to do so.","There is no safe haven in today's markets.","I'm rarely optimistic.","My concern as a citizen and as a money manager is, Oh my God, at what point does a 'whoa' moment happen to these people who own $30 trillion fixed income instruments?","So many people, including stark conservatives, have family members and close friends who are gay.","It is impossible to understand the financial health of big financial institutions and their potential impact on the market. They don't even understand it themselves.","There's a feeling among some people that the Republican party is harsh on some things.","Obviously, the institution of marriage in America has utterly collapsed.","What I think about derivatives is if every institution that owns or trades them is properly margined and marked to market, including end-users, including every institution, including sovereigns and multilateral institutions, then the system would be safe - if people were margined the way customers of investment banks are margined.","Capital is kind of a banking concept.","Margin is a customer concept.","'What am I missing?' is a much more important question than 'How cool am I?'","I've never let my guard down by saying, 'I don't need to be hedged.'","What you have in legacy countries is long-term insolvency.","Check out London, Manhattan, Aspen and East Hampton real estate prices, as well as high-end art prices, to see what the leading edge of hyperinflation could look like.","In both the U.S. and Europe, the budget and balance sheet numbers do not work. When 'off-balance sheet' promises are taken into account, the U.S. and most countries of the Euro zone are insolvent.","The world, in terms of choices available to educated, ambitious workers and entrepreneurs, is way bigger than just the United States, Japan and Europe.","Imagine how much capital a country like Argentina might attract - if instead of defaulting seriatim and affecting a pose of anger toward creditors, it borrowed responsibly and honored its obligations.","The bottom line is that the euro is a failed experiment.","Opacity on extreme levels is not addressed anywhere, including Dodd-Frank."],"Paul Sorvino":["There are many people who think I'm actually a gangster or a mafioso, largely because of 'Goodfella.'","I don't know what would have been worse: If Mira had come home one day to say she was gay or an actress.","Ultimately, love conquers all, and gay or straight, don't we all want to believe that? I would that if this was to happen to me, and one of my kids had come and told me he or she was gay, I would say: If that's the only way you can live, then I love you.","I have such an image of a mafioso.","Technically, I'm a knight. My family goes back a thousand years in the Naples area. We're a titled, noble people.","I'm a warrior if you try to hurt my family. And anybody I see getting it in the neck out there, I'm right there to protect them. I'm a big, strong guy who knows what he's doing. I've stopped a lot of things in the street, stopped a lot of people from getting hurt.","When I was 25, I was in a show called 'Bajour,' and I was going to leave the show because I couldn't breathe. I couldn't sing, and I couldn't do the basic dance steps I had to do. Fortunately, two actors in the production - who were also yoga instructors - taught me some breathing exercises, and my asthma was cured that day.","I prepare for every role. I come into class with my homework under my arm.","People see me in powerful roles. That's what people want to see. That's what I want to do.","Where the material is, that's where you go. I'm a workman: I go to work. I've done movies for nothing, literally nothing; I did 'Last I Heard' for next to nothing."],"Paul Sparks":["I've always been of the mindset that you will be defined by the things you say 'no' to because it's so easy to say 'yes.'","I actually did not like to run. It was probably my least favorite thing that I had to do, and then in 1999, I was diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic. It was really strange. One good thing to do for diabetes is to exercise. I don't really like gyms anymore, and I travel quite a bit, so I realized that you can just take shoes and shorts and run anywhere.","I'm pretty fortunate that my beard - if I shave it off, I look like a completely different person. My face, it transforms. I mean, I have a weird face! My eyes are really deep and sunken. My son tells me, 'You don't have any eyebrows.'","I think of myself as more additive than initially creative; I don't come up with the stories.","If I was able to be omniscient and look at my career objectively, I'd be very happy.","I'm a total slave to a good story.","Death scenes are hard. Sex scenes are hard.","No, I'm not angling for huge fame. My career has been a very slow, arduous climb to the middle.","When I got out of school, I just started doing plays of the off-off-Broadway route, and for many years, that's what I did, slowly doing work in tiny theaters, building relationships with people in the business. It's not a showy story.","A lot of times, sets are not such fun places to be, and especially television sets, because everybody works so hard, and everybody's kind of grumbling about getting up at 3 o'clock in the morning and not getting home until midnight.","I have a somewhat reclusive quality myself, and actually what's great about New York is that it pushes you to be social because the streets are full of people.","As actors, we get used to disappointment. We go on a hundred job interviews a year and get two or three jobs.","There's a real art to telling a story in two hours, and that will always be something that people are very, very interested in.","The characters I've played that I like the most are people that have a lot of obstacles. They have a lot of bad things going on. They're seeking to do something good amidst all the detritus around them, and they're aware of how badly they've screwed it up. That kind of self-awareness is tragic.","I just keep following the good writing. I'm not good enough to make bad writing look good. Some people can, and I admire them for it, but I cannot. I will go down with the ship.","As far as the destiny of the character, I just play them until they're gone. I try not to get too involved.","As an actor, I'm more interested in characters the longer I have lived with them.","I don't know everybody's political opinions, but I think the majority of people in the arts are pretty leftist, and we're disappointed in the Trump administration.","I just came home one day and, in a midlife-crisis sort of way, I told my wife, 'I'm going to run a marathon,' not really understanding what that was. Then I just kind of got into it, and now that I have been running pretty consistently over the past few years, I don't know if it's because I love it or because I hate myself. I just really enjoy it.","Endurance training is so mental. You just do it. You just can, and you just will, and you just run that far because, you know, I get tired at the first mile. I feel heavy and all of those things, but now I have developed, it's hard to explain... It's a very satisfying place to get into.","I think that's kind of nice that there's this kind of inherent respect between runners who do a marathon. People respect somebody who has done it, and I will do anything to get some respect because I don't get a lot respect in my life.","I sort of latch onto roles that have something to fight against."],"Paul Stamets":["Maitake mushrooms are known in Japan as 'the dancing mushroom.' According to a Japanese legend, a group of Buddhist nuns and woodcutters met on a mountain trail, where they discovered a fruiting of maitake mushrooms emerging from the forest floor. Rejoicing at their discovery of this delicious mushroom, they danced to celebrate.","From dead plant matter to nematodes to bacteria, never underestimate the cleverness of mushrooms to find new food!","Fungi are the grand recyclers of the planet and the vanguard species in habitat restoration.","Mushrooms are miniature pharmaceutical factories, and of the thousands of mushroom species in nature, our ancestors and modern scientists have identified several dozen that have a unique combination of talents that improve our health.","Mushrooms have many helpful nutrients, including beta glucans for immune enhancement, ergothioneines for antioxidative potentiation, nerve growth stimulators for helping brain function, and antimicrobial compounds for limiting viruses.","The virus-to-cancer connection is where medicinal mushrooms offer unique opportunities for medical research.","Mushrooms provide a vast array of potential medicinal compounds. Many mushrooms - such as portobello, oyster, reishi and maitake - are well-known for these properties, but the lion's mane mushroom, in particular, has drawn the attention of researchers for its notable nerve-regenerative properties.","If you do not know where the mushroom products you are consuming are grown, think twice before eating them.","Nature is a numbers game. We need all the support we can get as our immune systems and health are under assault from pollution, stress, contaminated food and age-related diseases as our lifespans increase.","Traditionally, our ancestors boiled mushrooms in water to make a soothing tea. Boiling served several purposes: killing contaminants, softening the flesh, and extracting the rich soluble polysaccharides.","Disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, floods, oil spills and radioactive fallout cause massive death of people, pigs, bats and birds. These disasters also impact the immune health of survivors. All harbor viruses.","In the wild, an enoki mushroom is often squat-looking and its stem is rarely more than twice as long as the cap is wide. When they are grown by farmers and hobbyists, however, their stems elongate, the caps are smaller, and a forest of golden colored needle-like mushrooms shoot up all at once.","Through trial-and-error and observable outcomes, our ancestors narrowed the field of edible mushroom candidates to just a few with remarkable, health-supporting properties.","Some people think I'm a mycological heretic, some people think I'm a mycological revolutionary, and some just think I'm crazy.","If you look on the fungal genome as being soldier candidates protecting the U.S. as our host defense, not only for the ecosystem but for our population... we should be saving our old-growth forests as a matter of national defense.","We evolved living in more sunlight than today. We make our own vitamin D when sunlight hits our skin cells. Many people living in the northern hemisphere, however, suffer from lower levels of vitamin D during the fall, winter and spring.","Known colloquially as 'winter,' 'golden needle,' and 'velvet foot' mushrooms, enoki mushrooms grow across much of the world, inhabiting dead conifer trees and stumps, and generally appearing throughout the late fall and winter months.","My family is delighted every time I cook maitake. Our taste buds awaken in anticipation of its rich, deep and nuanced flavors.","Although oyster mushrooms have been studied extensively and support health in a number of ways, it is also extremely important to always cook oyster mushrooms!","While reishi mushrooms have historically been prepared as teas or infusions, other modern preparations include capsules, tinctures, and fractionated extracts of mushrooms, mycelium, and spores.","Lion's mane may be our first 'smart' mushroom. It is a safe, edible fungus that appears to confer cognitive benefits on our aging population.","My team and I have discovered, over decades of study, that mushroom mycelium is a rich resource of new antimicrobial compounds, which work in concert, helping protecting the mushrooms - and us - from microbial pathogens.","Mycologists are few and far between. We are under-funded, poorly represented in the context of other sciences - ironic, as the very foundation of our ecosystems are directly dependent upon fungi, which ultimately create the foundation of soils.","Life exists throughout the cosmos and is a consequence of matter in the universe.","Turkey tail mushrooms have been used to treat various maladies for hundreds of years in Asia, Europe, and by indigenous peoples in North America. Records of turkey tail brewed as medicinal tea date from the early 15th century, during the Ming Dynasty in China.","Vitamin D from mushrooms is not only vegan and vegetarian friendly, but you can prepare your own by exposing mushrooms to the summer sun.","Enoki mushrooms, a tasty variety commonly sold in grocery stores, were one of the first mushrooms studied for preventing cancer.","Nitric oxide production by immune cells is one of the key mechanisms that our bodies use to destroy diseased cells. Enhancement of these types of immune responses is seen consistently with many medicinal mushrooms that have been tested by cancer researchers.","Maitake can achieve humongous sizes, sometimes up to 50 pounds per specimen! Massive maitake can form annually from dying dendritic tree roots for many years, even decades.","In the past, mushrooms were maligned as nutritionally poor. Since they are about 80 to 90 percent water when fresh, their net concentrations of nutrients can be underestimated. Like grains, however, mushrooms should be weighed when dry to get their correct nutrient value.","Of all mushrooms commonly consumed, oyster mushrooms in the genus Pleurotus stand out as exceptional allies for improving human and environmental health. These mushrooms enjoy a terrific reputation as the easiest to cultivate, richly nutritious and medicinally supportive.","Today, reishi stands out as one the most valuable of all polypore mushrooms in nature for the benefit of our health. Many naturopaths and doctors prefer organically-grown reishi from pristine environments because they are more pure.","Although the trends are promising and reishi mushrooms exhibit a number of interesting medicinal properties, modern scientific techniques have yet to affirm its traditional 'panacea polypore' status.","Chaga is one of the weirdest mushrooms you may ever see. A fungal parasite found on birch trees, Chaga is a hardened, blackened, crusty formation that looks like a bursting tumor.","Growing the mycelium of the Chaga mushroom under laboratory conditions provides an ecologically friendly alternative supply of this unique medicinal mushroom.","Chaga mycelium is relatively easy to grow by using methods already practiced elsewhere in the mushroom industry. Its mycelium is initially an off-whitish color, deepening with age.","Chaga is significant in ethnomycology, forest ecology, and increasingly in pharmacognosy. Its long-term human use and cultural eastern European and Russian acceptance should awaken serious researchers to its potential as a reservoir of new medicines, and as a powerful preventive ally for protecting DNA.","The majority of modern medicines originate in nature. Although some mushrooms have been used in therapies for thousands of years, we are still discovering new potential medicines hidden within them.","For many years, I have sought and studied Agarikon, an unusual mushroom native to the old growth conifer forests of North America and Europe.","Agarikon contains antiviral molecules new to science. Researchers for pharmaceutical companies may have missed its potent antiviral properties. Our analyses show that the mycelial cultures of this mushroom are most active but that the fruitbodies, the natural form of the mushroom, are not.","Lion's mane mushrooms are not your classic-looking cap-and-stem variety. These globular-shaped mushrooms sport cascading teeth-like spines rather than the more common gills."],"Paul Stanley":["My workout is always with a trainer because, quite honestly, I don't think most people are motivated enough to do what they need to on their own. You either need a spotter or you need a trainer. You need somebody there to push you to get that extra five.","When you're in a position to have gotten so much, the gift at this point is giving back.","Credibility is someone else's idea of what I should be doing.","There's a difference between standing up and telling people what you're planning to do and standing up and going and accomplishing something.","In terms of merchandise, you can't force anyone to buy something.","People relate to the spirit of the band, which is to live your way and succeed on your own terms. There's no hypocrisy in being successful and still railing against conformity.","The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is marketing. You've got a bunch of faceless people in a back room who trademark a name that sounds very official. Well, if you had thought of it first, you would have been the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.","Whenever anybody comes to me with a way that I can give something back, it would be ungrateful at this point in my life to not say yes.","The financial reward is great and I love the life I have, but all money makes possible is for you to stop worrying about money. Then you have freedom to live your life.","When you start fooling around with drugs, you're hurting your creativity, you're hurting your health. Drugs are death, in one form or another. If they don't kill you, they kill your soul. And if your soul's dead, you've got nothing to offer, anyway.","I tend to fly a bit under the radar.","You can't enter the Olympics unless you do your routine to get in shape for it. The idea of going out on stage on a tour without having prepped for it would be suicide, literally.","When rock & roll is done with that fervor, it's close to gospel.","I had heard some women make comments about my chest, so why not show it off? Nobody wants to see a fat guy in tights. That wouldn't be fair to the fans.","Core strengthening is key to everything. It's not just about the way I look, but about stabilizing my body so I can perform better on stage.","There are no fans more rabid or devoted than KISS fans. KISS fans are what all other fans are measured against. That's how it came to be known as the KISS Army.","The fact that you can't base a coffeehouse on any other rock band is the other rock bands' problem, not mine.","The whole idea of rock and roll lifestyle is a cartoon. It's a caricature. And at times, it's made up of people emulating others; a few who actually live that lifestyle and many who claim to live that lifestyle.","Gene sometimes... well, he has his dream list.","A Kiss concert experience is like sex or anything else that's done with more that one person. It's the give and take that makes it so great. When the audience takes it to the next level, we can kick it up another notch.","The great thing about rock-n-roll is you realize the top of the mountain is big enough for more than one band.","Nothing could ever stop Kiss. I've seen the band in down times where critics were like vultures circling overhead saying things like, 'Well, you know it's the end of your career.'","Doing my art came out of something very solitary and something that I had no intention of showing anybody, and yet once people saw pieces in my house, it became really clear that there was a great demand for my art.","The only thing I can say is consistent in all my paintings is vivid color.","Youth is incredible because you really do feel invincible.","I started working out, doing a formal workout right around 1980. That's when I really decided I needed to get in shape and it may have been because you just start to see a decrease - a change in your body.","Democracy in the studio is overrated. What you wind up getting is compromise on everybody's part, which means that nobody has their way, and that means nobody wins, including the fans.","I never thought being the producer was being the dictator. It means being the director and being the coach. It's a way of keeping everybody focused on the goal, and also having final say. Everybody can be in the same car, but somebody has to drive.","I was lucky enough as a kid to spend most of my weekends at the Fillmore East. On a great night, that was like a Holy Roller evangelical church.","To go from being an unpopular, chubby little kid who was chasing girls and couldn't seem to catch them, to being chased after and making sure I ran slow enough that I did get caught, it was 180 degree turn. It was being given the keys to the candy store.","I'm a great believer in not over-thinking lyrics. You might become technically better as a songwriter, but you lose what originally made your songs great.","I'm damn successful but I got here by not taking crap. I still don't take crap, so if anybody needs a champion, let it be me.","Anybody with money can put on a KISS show, but they can't be KISS.","KISS has always been outside of the borders of what other bands can do. Not that some of these other bands wouldn't want to do it - the fact that they may snicker or look down their noses at what we do is more out of jealously than anything else.","If I had my way, I'd always be onstage. But I won't always be able to be onstage.","As big as my ego may be, I'm really not of the belief that I can't be replaced. I didn't invent the wheel. There's someone else out there who can do what I do, maybe a little differently. I believe that Kiss is bigger than its individual members.","The only exercise I got as a kid was fork to mouth. Food was equated with love in my household. I thought you left the table when the zipper was down and you'd explode if you took another bite. I'd eat my plate and then everyone else's leftovers.","I was a chubby boy. My pants used to wear out in the middle, and it was because my legs used to rub together. I wasn't obese, just chunky.","What it comes down to is, Kiss has always been a beast that has this tendency to run wild, and it needs attention and nurturing. If people are always running off and doing other projects, which has been the case, somebody has to be there for stability.","I've seen myself do stuff on stage that was pretty amazing. I think that would be true for any athlete. Any top athlete will see something that they are very proud of. All my injuries will attest to the fact that besides being a musician, it comes down to being an athlete.","If I write for myself, I write a song and I bring in the musicians that are best suited to play it. There's a freedom there.","I am one of the biggest Laura Nyro fans. I still listen to that stuff incessantly. Laura Nyro does not belong in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Songwriter Hall of Fame? Absolutely.","It's absurd for anybody to look around and hear the acts and artists who cite us as an inspiration, and then tell me that we're not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.","I'm a real foodie.","Autobiographies, for the most part, to me, are like writing a love letter to yourself.","I've seen people around me write books, and somehow they're always in the center of everything that happened; they were the one who made it happen. There's been a lot of those books that didn't really interest me much.","Tooting my own horn is of no interest to me... it takes you away from real life. It's a waste, and I don't find a need to sing my own praises.","I think KISS has always been about celebrating self-empowerment. Celebrating the idea that anything is possible with determination and hard work.","I don't know what's more embarrassing, these musicians and actors talking about politics in interviews or the media actually giving them credibility about it. It's absurd that a celebrity could speak out on the economy or politics with no more justification than a hit album or a movie.","America is a business. If you can't afford to do something, no matter how much bellyaching everybody does... I'm so sorry, if you can't afford it, you shouldn't do it.","Don't kid yourself; the guy who's onstage in ripped-up jeans is wearing as much a costume as I am.","The great thing about doing art shows is you get to meet the people who are interested in your art, and I think that when you're purchasing a piece of art it's a tremendous bonus to get to meet the artist because you get a chance to pick their brain a bit and find out first hand what the piece is about for the artist.","I think that ultimately - as I say to most of the people who are acquiring art - I can tell you my reality of a piece, but ultimately what's more important will be yours. I can tell you what a piece means to me, but just as valid if not more is what it means to you.","I love being a member of KISS."],"Paul Strand":["Your photography is a record of your living, for anyone who really sees.","The artist's world is limitless.

Not to be to cliche, but really sensual and sultry.","A lot of people are doing something about their weight, but by their own reckoning, it isn't enough to get the results they want.","I know I can't do everything myself. So I know I specialize in my melodies and I do some of my demo work. I pass it on to my producers who are much better at the production level.","I like to do cover songs if I really love them, I have to love the song first.","I get like a melody that comes up and I try to write it down or record it.

So I understand why a tourist economy is necessary.","I believe I have a sunny disposition, and am not naturally a grouch. It takes a lot of optimism, after all, to be a traveler.","I grew up in an era of thinking of travel as escape. The idea that you could conceivably have a new life, go somewhere, fall in love, have little children under the palm trees.","The moment that changed me for ever was the moment my first child was born. I was happy, filled with hope, and thought, 'Now I understand the whole point of work, of life, of love.'","Fiction gives us the second chances that life denies us.","I can't predict how reading habits will change. But I will say that the greatest loss is the paper archive - no more a great stack of manuscripts, letters, and notebooks from a writer's life, but only a tiny pile of disks, little plastic cookies where once were calligraphic marvels.","When I went to Hong Kong, I knew at once I wanted to write a story set there.","Maine out of season is unmistakably a great destination: hospitable, good-humored, plenty of elbow room, short days, dark nights of crackling ice crystals.","I wanted the Peace Corps to be something very vague and unorganized, and to a large extent it was. It did not run smoothly. The consequence was that we were left alone.","The two impulses in travel are to get away from home, and the other is to pursue something - a landscape, people, an exotic place. Certainly finding a place that you like or discovering something unusual is a very sustaining thing in travel.","I don't think I've ever seen a person having a serious conversation on a cellphone. It's like a kiddie thing, a complete time waster.","I cannot make my days longer so I strive to make them better.","What draws me in is that a trip is a leap in the dark. It's like a metaphor for life. You set off from home, and in the classic travel book, you go to an unknown place. You discover a different world, and you discover yourself.","Maine is a joy in the summer. But the soul of Maine is more apparent in the winter.","Friendship is also about liking a person for their failings, their weakness. It's also about mutual help, not about exploitation.","Many small towns I know in Maine are as tight-knit and interdependent as those I associate with rural communities in India or China; with deep roots and old loyalties, skeptical of authority, they are proud and inflexibly territorial.","There are two worlds: the world of the tourist and the world of everyone else. Often they're side by side. But the tourist doesn't actually see how people live.","Gain a modest reputation for being unreliable and you will never be asked to do a thing.","People write about getting sick, they write about tummy trouble, they write about having to wait for a bus. They write about waiting. They write three pages about how long it took them to get a visa. I'm not interested in the boring parts. Everyone has tummy trouble. Everyone waits in line. I don't want to hear about it.","When I was in the Peace Corps I never made a phone call. I was in Central Africa; I didn't make a phone call for two years. I was in Uganda for another four years and I didn't make a phone call. So for six years I didn't make a phone call, but I wrote letters, I wrote short stories, I wrote books.","You define a good flight by negatives: you didn't get hijacked, you didn't crash, you didn't throw up, you weren't late, you weren't nauseated by the food. So you are grateful.","Travel magazines are just one cupcake after another. They're not about travel. The travel magazine is, in fact, about the opposite of travel. It's about having a nice time on a honeymoon, or whatever.","The travel impulse is mental and physical curiosity. It's a passion. And I can't understand people who don't want to travel.","You can't write about a friend, you can only write about a former friend.","Death is an endless night so awful to contemplate that it can make us love life and value it with such passion that it may be the ultimate cause of all joy and all art.","Extensive traveling induces a feeling of encapsulation, and travel, so broadening at first, contracts the mind.","I'm constantly running across people who have never heard of books I think they should read.","Mark Twain was a great traveler and he wrote three or four great travel books. I wouldn't say that I'm a travel novelist but rather a novelist who travels - and who uses travel as a background for finding stories of places.","What strikes me about high-school reunions is the realization that these are people one has known one's whole life.","The impulse to write comes, I think, from a desire - perhaps a need - to give imaginative life to experience, to share it with the reader, not to cover up the truth but to deliver it obliquely.","The idea of traveling in Africa for me is based on going by road or train or bus or whatever and crossing borders. You can't travel easily or at all through some countries.","There are places that I've always wanted to go. First I went to Africa, and when I was there I realized there were places in Africa I really to wanted to visit: The Congo, West Africa, Mombassa. I wanted to see the deep, dark, outlandish places.","The Peace Corps is a sort of Howard Johnson's on the main drag into maturity.","Travel is glamorous only in retrospect.","It is usually expensive and lonely to be principled.","Writing is pretty crummy on the nerves.","The Australian Book of Etiquette is a very slim volume.","There are probably more annoying things than being hectored about African development by a wealthy Irish rock star in a cowboy hat, but I can't think of one at the moment.","The Japanese have perfected good manners and made them indistinguishable from rudeness.","Men in their late 50s often make very bad decisions.","When I write about my childhood I think, oh my God, how did I ever get from there to here? Not that any great thing has happened to me. But I felt so tiny, so lost.","I like the idea of isolation, I like the idea of solitude. You can be connected and have a phone and still be lonely.","Travel works best when you're forced to come to terms with the place you're in.","A travel book is about someone who goes somewhere, travels on the ground, sees something and spends quite a lot of time doing it, and has a hard time, and then comes back and writes about it. It's not about inventing.","It's only when you're alone that you realize where you are. You have nothing to fall back on except your own resources.","The amount of hassle involved in travel can be overwhelming.","A novel captures essence that is not possible in any other form.","The people of Hong Kong are criticized for only being interested in business, but it's the only thing they've been allowed to do.","People who don't read books a lot are threatened by books.","When I began to make some money, I really wanted to have a home.","Fiction writing, and the reading of it, and book buying, have always been the activities of a tiny minority of people, even in the most-literate societies.","Many aspects of the writing life have changed since I published my first book, in the 1960s. It is more corporate, more driven by profits and marketing, and generally less congenial - but my day is the same: get out of bed, procrastinate, sit down at my desk, try to write something.","Literary life used to be quite different in Britain in the years I lived there, from 1971 to 1989, because money was not a factor - no one made very much except from U.S. sales and the occasional windfall.","If you're a misanthrope you stay at home. There are certain writers who really don't like other people. I'm not like that, I don't think.","When I left Africa in 1966 it seemed to me to be a place that was developing, going in a particular direction, and I don't think that is the case now. And it's a place where people still kid themselves - you know, in a few years this will happen or that will happen. Well, it's not going to happen. It's never going to happen.","I think I understand passion. Love is something else.","I think that love isn't what you think it is when you're in your twenties or even thirties.","Love doesn't last.","The more you write, the more you're capable of writing.","Although I'm not fluent in sign language by a long way, I could have a fairly decent conversation.","When I started writing, I did have some idealised notion of my dad as a writer. But I have less and less of a literary rivalry with him as I've gone on. I certainly don't feel I need his approval, although maybe that's because I'm confident that I've got it.","I know there are writers who feel unhappy with domesticity and who even manufacture domestic turmoil in order to have something to write about. With me, though, the happier I feel, the better I write.","The pleasure a reader gets is often equal to the pleasure a writer is given.","People talk about the pain of writing, but very few people talk about the pleasure and satisfaction.","My house is a place I have spent many years improving to the point where I have no desire to leave it.","You may not know it but I'm no good at coping with all the attention in the luxury hotels I sometimes find myself in.","My greatest inspiration is memory.","I loathe blogs when I look at them. Blogs look, to me, illiterate. They look hasty, like someone babbling.","To me, writing is a considered act. It's something which is a great labor of thought and consideration.","One of the things the 'Tao of Travel' shows is how unforthcoming most travel writers are, how most travelers are. They don't tell you who they were traveling with, and they're not very reliable about things that happened to them.","The people I've known who've done great things of that type - you know, building hospitals, running schools - are very humble people. They give their lives to the project.","Henry Miller, Jack Kerouac, Albert Camus, Graham Greene - they influenced my life to a profound extent.","I hate vacations. I hate them. I have no fun on them. I get nothing done. People sit and relax, but I don't want to relax. I want to see something.","I was raised in a large family. The first reason for my travel was to get away from my family. I knew that I wanted to be a writer, but I didn't want people to ask me questions about it.","People say writing is really hard. That's very unfair to those who are doing real jobs. People who work in the fields or fix roofs, engineers, or car mechanics. I think lying on your back working under an oily car, that's a job.","My father had an invisible job outside of the house; I didn't know what he did. But my kids were privy to the ups and downs of a writer's life.","I feel as if my mission is to write, to see, to observe, and I feel lazy if I'm not reaching conclusions. I feel stupid. I feel as if I'm wasting my time.","Dentists seem to me very orderly, businesslike people who appear to become somewhat bored with the routine of their work after a period of time. Perhaps I'm wrong.","A travel book is a book that puts you in the shoes of the traveler, and it's usually a book about having a very bad time; having a miserable time, even better.","There's books that are about places we will never go, and then there's books that inspire us to go.","The United States is a world unto itself. We have mountains, we have deserts, we have a river that equals the Yangtze River, that equals the Nile. We have the greatest cities in the world - among the greatest cities in the world.","You leave the States, and you see people have bigger problems than you, much worse problems than you.","I'm not pessimistic about Africa. The cities just seem big and hopeless. But there's still a great green heart where there's possibility. There's hope in the wilderness.","A place that doesn't welcome tourists, that's really difficult and off the map, is a place I want to see.","The worst thing that can happen to you in travel is having a gun pointed at you by a very young person. That's happened to me maybe four times in my life. I didn't like it.","A journey awakens all our old fears of danger and risk. Your life is on the line. You are living by your own resources; you have to find your own way and solve every problem on the road.","The appeal of travel books is also the sense that you are different, an outsider, almost like the Robinson Crusoe or Christopher Columbus notion of being the first person in a new place.","I think people read travel books either because they intend to take that trip, or because they would never take that trip. In a sense, as a writer you are doing the travel for the reader.","I wouldn't say that I'm a travel novelist, but rather a novelist who travels - and who uses travel as a background for finding stories of places.","You can't separate the people from the places - although I sometimes like traveling in places where there are no people.","Africa is really a place for the wealthy traveler. It's got some nice hotels, but they're very expensive hotels. It doesn't really cater to the backpacker or to the overland traveler.","The place that interests me most, actually, is the United States. I've realized that I haven't traveled much in the States. There's a lot to see.","Ever since childhood, when I lived within earshot of the Boston and Maine, I have seldom heard a train go by and not wished I was on it.","Anything is possible on a train: a great meal, a binge, a visit from card players, an intrigue, a good night's sleep, and strangers' monologues framed like Russian short stories.","The Trans-Siberian Express is like a cruise across an oceanic landscape. I've done it three times.","I have written stories, essays, even whole books on trains, scribble-scribble.","You need to be on your own so that you can meet people as you are, and as they are.","Writing was in my mind from the time I was in high school, but more, the idea that I would be a doctor. I really wanted to be a medical doctor, and I had various schemes: one was to be a psychiatrist, another was tropical medicine.","My earliest thought, long before I was in high school, was just to go away, get out of my house, get out of my city. I went to Medford High School, but even in grade school and junior high, I fantasized about leaving.","I've never spent a whole year in one place without leaving.","People see a hungry face, and they want to feed it; that's a natural response.","I do not want to be young again.","I was kind of raised with the suggestion that I had a duty to do; that life was real, life was earnest. And I hated that, actually. I needed to be liberated, to be told that I could live the life that I wanted to live; that I didn't need a job, or to be shouted at; that I could be myself; that I could be happy.","Japan, Germany, and India seem to me to have serious writers, readers, and book buyers, but the Netherlands has struck me as the most robust literary culture in the world.","Movable type seemed magical to the monks who were illuminating manuscripts and copying texts. Certainly e-books seem magical to me.","I think there is only one way to write fiction - alone, in a room, without interruption or any distraction.","A gun show is about like-minded people who feel as if everything has been taken away from them - jobs, money, pride.","I should start by saying that traveling in the States is a bit like traveling in Asia. You need it, it helps to have an introduction - that there is a certain network.","There are two places that are hard to write about. A place like Britain, England in particular, which has been written about by everybody, and then the place that's never been written about.","Everything is fiction. You only have your own life to work with in the way that a biographer only has the letters and journals to work with.","One of my fears is not writing. I don't know how to do anything else.","If you look at a map, you see that Hawaii is in the middle of nowhere. It's 17 hours of straight flying from London. It's very far away, and sometimes you feel as if you're on another planet. But I like that. Also, that's ideal for writing.","I have spent my life on the road waking in a pleasant, or not so pleasant hotel, and setting off every morning after breakfast hoping to discover something new and repeatable, something worth writing about.","My love for traveling to islands amounts to a pathological condition known as nesomania, an obsession with islands. This craze seems reasonable to me, because islands are small self-contained worlds that can help us understand larger ones.","An island is a fixed and finite piece of geography, and usually the whole place has been carved up and claimed.","Because of my capacity for listening to strangers' tales, or the details of their lives, my patience with their food and their crotchets, my curiosity that borders on nosiness, I am told that anyone traveling with me experiences an unbelievable tedium, and this is why I choose to travel alone.","My record was so bad that I was first rejected by the Peace Corps as a poor risk and possible troublemaker and was accepted as a volunteer only after a great deal of explaining and arguing.","Nyasaland was the perfect country for a volunteer. It was friendly and destitute; it was small and out-of-the-way. It had all of Africa's problems - poverty, ignorance, disease.","I think I am typical in believing that the Peace Corps trained us brilliantly and then did little more except send us into the bush. It was not a bad way of running things.","I have always felt that the truth is prophetic, and that if you describe precisely what you see and give it life with your imagination, then what you write ought to have lasting value, no matter what the mood of your prose.","Television cannot film corruption. Television cannot spend five days on a rattling railway train, talking endlessly. Television needs excitement, it needs an angle, it needs a 'sound bite.","The job of the travel writer is to go far and wide, to make voluminous notes, to tell the truth."],"Paul Thomas Anderson":["Screenwriting is like ironing. You move forward a little bit and go back and smooth things out.","I'll rebel against powers and principalities, all the time. Always, I will.","I don't get a sense of American pride. I just get a sense that everyone is here, battling the same thing - that around the world everybody's after the same thing, just some minor piece of happiness each day.","I'm completely aware of the fact that I'm a control freak.","My writing has a lot to do with who I am, and what my life is like, and my relationships to people.","Acting is the hardest job in the entire world. By far. Harder than ditch digging.","It's a gamble you take, the risk of alienating an audience. But there's a theory - sometimes it's better to confuse them for five minutes than let them get ahead of you for 10 seconds.","I am always looking for that nuance, that moment of truth, and you can't really do that fast.","Film school is a complete con, because the information is there if you want it.","How do I respond to criticism? Critically. I listen to all criticism critically.","I remember being taught in school that you would underline things that you liked. I remember just underlining everything as a kid, thinking, 'This has all gotta be important!' I would just underline the whole thing!","I don't think it's a director's job to peek behind the curtain too much.","As I have got older and become a father, there's less and less time for films.","I write from my stomach.","You have to be a brat in order to carve out your parameters, and you have to be a monster to anyone who gets in your way. But sometimes it's difficult to know when that's necessary and when you're just being a baby, throwing your rattle from the cage.","To make a film, the final big collaborator that you have is the composer.","Clinton used to like to get out of the White House a lot. He would take night trips to McDonald's, and stuff like that. I think he wanted to get out of the house.","No, really. Just do it. You have some kind of weird reasons that are okay.","I have a feeling, one of those gut feelings, that I'll make pretty good movies the rest of my life.","No matter how many times you do it, you don't get used to the sadness - for me at least - of coming to the end of a film.","Well I'd really love to work with Robert De Niro, because he's still the most talented actor out there.","But I'd be lying if I didn't say that every time you go to make a film, you're desperate to either do it better than you did it last time or to not repeat yourself.","I don't miss scenes at all the way that I used to miss them when I was younger making a film. It's actually quite fun to get rid of them now.","It felt like the first thing, but when I first started out, I got a job adapting a book by Russell Banks called 'Rule Of The Bone.' I didn't do a very good job. I didn't really know what I was doing in general, let alone how to adapt a book.","I actually enjoyed the struggles that we had trying to shape 'Blood', to get the pacing right, the rhythm of it.","So with 'There Will Be Blood,' I didn't even really feel like I was adapting a book. I was just desperate to find stuff to write.","I had never read Upton Sinclair. I didn't read 'The Jungle' in high school or anything like that. But it's pretty terrific writing.","The films that I love are very straightforward stories, like really old-fashioned stuff.","I've never been a fan of whimsical or confusing storytelling.","I didn't have any desire I might have had 10 years ago to shoot every single word that I wrote.","Of course, I'm no dummy.","I don't want to be the angry guy.","My dad was this sort of avant-garde guy who did all kinds of weird things. He was a true original and anybody who met him never forgot him.","My older sister was at the cusp of new wave, and I had older brothers from my father's first marriage who were rock 'n' roll guys, so I was exposed to a lot of popular culture.","I had the standard movie geek childhood, because for as long as I can remember, all I wanted to do was make movies.","I always had a dream about trying to make a movie that had no dialogue in it, that was just music and pictures. I still haven't done it yet, but I tried to get close in the beginning.","You know, I'm really not that competent at describing things musically.","There's a lot for screenwriters to steal from songwriters, in terms of getting to the point.","I really subscribe to that old adage that you should never let the audience get ahead of you for a second. So if the film's abrasive and wrongfoots people then, y'know, that's great. But I hope it involves an audience.","Crazy is so hard to play, there's nothing you can really tell an actor.","I'm not really a Sundance baby, but they helped me so much I feel I have to acknowledge it.","I don't think the competition's so rough, within the majority of movies made in Hollywood.","I think my job is to try and be as honest as I can with what is in my mind and how I feel - I think that's what you're supposed to do, if you're a good writer. So I try to do that. I know I do that. I do do that."],"Paul Tillich":["Loneliness expresses the pain of being alone and solitude expresses the glory of being alone.","Language... has created the word 'loneliness' to express the pain of being alone. And it has created the word 'solitude' to express the glory of being alone.","We can speak without voice to the trees and the clouds and the waves of the sea. Without words they respond through the rustling of leaves and the moving of clouds and the murmuring of the sea.","Our language has wisely sensed the two sides of being alone. It has created the word loneliness to express the pain of being alone. And it has created the word solitude to express the glory of being alone.","Doubt is not the opposite of faith; it is one element of faith.","The first duty of love is to listen.","He who risks and fails can be forgiven. He who never risks and never fails is a failure in his whole being.","Religion is the state of being grasped by an ultimate concern, a concern which qualifies all other concerns as preliminary and which itself contains the answer to the question of a meaning of our life.","There is no love which does not become help.","Man's ultimate concern must be expressed symbolically, because symbolic language alone is able to express the ultimate.","Neurosis is the way of avoiding non-being by avoiding being.","The courage to be is rooted in the God who appears when God has disappeared in the anxiety of doubt.","The awareness of the ambiguity of one's highest achievements (as well as one's deepest failures) is a definite symptom of maturity.","Being religious means asking passionately the question of the meaning of our existence and being willing to receive answers, even if the answers hurt.","Cruelty towards others is always also cruelty towards ourselves.","Faith is an act of a finite being who is grasped by, and turned to, the infinite.","The courage to be is the courage to accept oneself, in spite of being unacceptable.","Decision is a risk rooted in the courage of being free.","Faith consists in being vitally concerned with that ultimate reality to which I give the symbolical name of God. Whoever reflects earnestly on the meaning of life is on the verge of an act of faith.","Astonishment is the root of philosophy.","I hope for the day when everyone can speak again of God without embarrassment.","Faith is the state of being ultimately concerned.","Boredom is rage spread thin.","Man is asked to make of himself what he is supposed to become to fulfill his destiny.","If my tongue were trained to measures, I would sing a stirring song."],"Paul Tonko":["Government spending clearly needs some adjusting. But a budget is a statement of our priorities, and balancing our spending on the backs of our nation's seniors is not the right approach.","On Medicare, I would suggest ridding the system of fraud and bulk purchasing of prescription drugs, to begin with.","Many climate change deniers would have you believe that addressing climate change is all pain and no gain. This is simply not true. We can tackle this challenge while improving our personal health and the health of our economy. These are not competing interests; they go hand in hand.","We must reign in overspending by ridding government of outmoded programs, making Big Oil pay their fair share, repealing massive tax breaks for corporations that ship jobs overseas, and enacting a tax code that no longer favors millionaires and billionaires.","Let's restore sanity and fairness to the tax cut conversation. We simply cannot afford to hand over the bank vault to our nation's millionaires and billionaires while the middle class picks up spare change.","Surely there are common-sense reforms that we should, and must, take in order to keep our children and our communities safe. I take these recommendations very seriously, and will listen to the voices of my constituents to ensure I do everything I can to help prevent gun violence.","Plain and simple, Congress must act to meet the needs of our constituents. We can do that by strengthening families, increasing the minimum wage, and ensuring equal pay for equal work.","We cannot get serious about helping the private sector create quality jobs without focusing first on the main drivers of our economy - the American middle class and those struggling to enter it.","When women succeed, America succeeds.","As Americans, we have traditionally been the optimists sporting the 'can-do' attitude. But when it comes to addressing climate adaptation and resiliency, we seem to be more 'can't do' than 'can-do.'","As the U.S. did during the Space Race, we must invest in our businesses and intellect to ensure America leads the clean energy economy of the future. As we all know, the best way to reduce our deficit and bring down our debt is by putting Americans back to work.","When a part of our nation gets knocked down, we come together to help pick it up again. No questions asked. That's the American way, and I would expect every single member of Congress to support that sentiment with their words, their actions, and their votes.","Americans are falling out of the middle class, not into it. And they deserve relief. I absolute support extending the Bush tax cuts for those who work the hardest and invest the most in our economy - the real drivers of American growth, the middle class.","Taxpayer dollars should not be used as a reward for contractor executives, especially when other segments of society are hurting."],"Paul Tournier":["Nothing makes us so lonely as our secrets.","Recounting of a life story, a mind thinking aloud leads one inevitably to the consideration of problems which are no longer psychological but spiritual.","Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can.","Acceptance of one's life has nothing to do with resignation; it does not mean running away from the struggle. On the contrary, it means accepting it as it comes, with all the handicaps of heredity, of suffering, of psychological complexes and injustices.","At the heart of personality is the need to feel a sense of being lovable without having to qualify for that acceptance.","The more refined and subtle our minds, the more vulnerable they are.","Let us not seek to bring religion to others, but let us endeavor to live it ourselves."],"Paul Tsongas":["America is hope. It is compassion. It is excellence. It is valor.","We are a continuum. Just as we reach back to our ancestors for our fundamental values, so we, as guardians of that legacy, must reach ahead to our children and their children. And we do so with a sense of sacredness in that reaching.","No one is immune from the larger events of his or her time - the Depression, World War II, civil rights, Vietnam, the spring of 1989 in China. These events intrude upon our lives and radically affect our directions.","No one on his deathbed ever said, I wish I had spent more time on my business.","Journey with me to a true commitment to our environment. Journey with me to the serenity of leaving to our children a planet in equilibrium.","A commencement is a time of joy. It is also a time of melancholy. But then again, so is life.","America is the sum of all our journeys as we search for our national community and our national culture.","Don't fear your mortality, because it is this very mortality that gives meaning and depth and poignancy to all the days that will be granted to you.","That sense of sacredness, that thinking in generations, must begin with reverence for this earth.","In this era of the global village, the tide of democracy is running. And it will not cease, not in China, not in South Africa, not in any corner of this earth, where the simple idea of democracy and freedom has taken root.","I want to deploy the leadership to meet the challenges that face us and to restore America's greatness.","From a viable economy to the full funding of Headstart, from a clean environment to true equality for women, from a strong military to a commitment to racial brotherhood, from schools that are honored to streets free of excessive violence.","Our only weapons in this war of your lifetime are the weapons of the mind.","Two hundred years ago, our Founding Fathers gave us a democracy. It was based upon the simple, yet noble, idea that government derives its validity from the consent of the governed.","Our destiny is greatness and we must return to its fulfillment.","Thinking in generations also means enabling our young to have a decent standard of living.","This land, this water, this air, this planet - this is our legacy to our young.","That's a good question. Let me try to evade you.","Let's try winning and see what it feels like. If we don't like it, we can go back to our traditions.","When George Bush used the Willie Horton ad, he knew what he was doing.","I have pretty much made up my mind to do this.","I am an American. I love this country.","You are Americans. You love this country. Together we are entrusted with the principles that represent mankind's greatest political and social achievement.","Seven and half years ago I began my own journey. For me and my family it was a time of adversity. But during that adversity I derived a deeper faith. And born out of that adversity was a commitment to devote myself to those people and to those issues that truly matter to me.","It was a myth that's often perpetuated at commencement that holds that only hope and promise lie beyond the halls of academe. Don't worry, be happy. Everything is fine.","My father's generation gave to my generation a land of wealth and purpose and world economic dominance.","You are part of that horrid expression, the best and the brightest. It can be a terrible burden if you let it be, but it is the great challenge of your time. And being a warrior in that challenge should be wondrous."],"Paul Tudor Jones":["Much of my adult life has been spent fighting for equal opportunity, and the idea that I would support limiting opportunity for any segment of society, particularly women, is antithetical to who I am and what I have done.","The secret to being successful from a trading perspective is to have an indefatigable and an undying and unquenchable thirst for information and knowledge.","I believe that great success is possible in any field - from music to mathematics to macro trading.","Trading is very competitive and you have to be able to handle getting your butt kicked.","As I've told my three daughters, all of whom I've at one time encouraged to go into macro trading, any man or woman can do anything to which they set their heart and mind.","You will never see as many great women investors or traders as men. Period. End of story.","Macro-trading requires a high degree of skill, focus and repetition. Life events, such as birth, divorce, death of a loved one and other emotional highs and lows are obstacles to success in this specific field of finance.","There is no training, classroom or otherwise, that can prepare for trading the last third of a move, whether it's the end of a bull market or the end of a bear market.","Intellectual capital will always trump financial capital."],"Paul Twitchell":["The minister and the priest teach that the organization is greater. No great philosophy has ever come from an organization, but from an individual whose research has been a personal study of God and ITS ways.","To recognize negativism as a force of creation is to give up the creative standpoint altogether.","Substance must emanate from spirit and is nothing else than the record of the spirit's conception of itself finding expression in space and time.","Our spiritual attitude is determined by our conception of our relation to infinite spirit.","The higher one climbs on the spiritual ladder, the more they will grant others their own freedom, and give less interference to another's state of consciousness.","There is no teacher, living or past, who can give us the actual understanding of Truth. A teacher can only put our feet upon the path and point the way. That is all. It is wholly dependent on the individual to make his way to Truth.","My sense of divine brings with it a strange sound of music with its glories, a marvellous melody sounding like a multitude of flutes.","Y'know, the real reason why I was such a failure in the sense of being unable to make any sort of a living was because I was really not motivated. I had no motivation."],"Paul Valery":["The best way to make your dreams come true is to wake up.","A poem is never finished, only abandoned.","War: a massacre of people who don't know each other for the profit of people who know each other but don't massacre each other.","A great man is one who leaves others at a loss after he is gone.","At times I think and at times I am.","A man who is 'of sound mind' is one who keeps the inner madman under lock and key.","Politeness is organized indifference.","The trouble with our times is that the future is not what it used to be.","A businessman is a hybrid of a dancer and a calculator.","The folly of mistaking a paradox for a discovery, a metaphor for a proof, a torrent of verbiage for a spring of capital truths, and oneself for an oracle, is inborn in us.","An artist never really finishes his work, he merely abandons it.","God made everything out of nothing, but the nothingness shows through.","The universe is built on a plan the profound symmetry of which is somehow present in the inner structure of our intellect.","A man is a poet if difficulties inherent in his art provide him with ideas; he is not a poet if they deprive him of ideas.","Love is being stupid together.","We are enriched by our reciprocate differences.","Books have the same enemies as people: fire, humidity, animals, weather, and their own content.","The purpose of psychology is to give us a completely different idea of the things we know best.","Poe is the only impeccable writer. He was never mistaken.","The future, like everything else, is not what it used to be.","Two dangers constantly threaten the world: order and disorder.","History is the science of things which are not repeated.","God created man and, finding him not sufficiently alone, gave him a companion to make him feel his solitude more keenly.","In poetry everything which must be said is almost impossible to say well.","Politics is the art of preventing people from busying themselves with what is their own business.","Power without abuse loses its charm.","A man is infinitely more complicated than his thoughts.","A man's true secrets are more secret to himself than they are to others.","Serious-minded people have few ideas. People with ideas are never serious.","Long years must pass before the truths we have made for ourselves become our very flesh.","That which has always been accepted by everyone, everywhere, is almost certain to be false.","Science means simply the aggregate of all the recipes that are always successful. All the rest is literature.","That which has been believed by everyone, always and everywhere, has every chance of being false.","The history of thought may be summed up in these words: it is absurd by what it seeks and great by what it finds.","Our judgments judge us, and nothing reveals us, exposes our weaknesses, more ingeniously than the attitude of pronouncing upon our fellows.","Man's great misfortune is that he has no organ, no kind of eyelid or brake, to mask or block a thought, or all thought, when he wants to.","To write regular verses destroys an infinite number of fine possibilities, but at the same time it suggests a multitude of distant and totally unexpected thoughts."],"Paul Verhoeven":["Science fiction is about worlds you don't know and worlds you can create, like in 'Avatar'.","I had decided after 'Hollow Man' to stay away from science fiction. I felt I had done so much science fiction. Four of the six movies I made in Hollywood are science-fiction oriented, and even 'Basic Instinct' is kind of science fiction.","My first film was a comedy, but after that I went always into more heavier stuff.","I had become a film director because I thought I could express something in an artful way.","Jesus may have had an immense sense of importance or destiny, but he never claimed to be the Son of God.","Jesus was a human being, bound by history and the natural world; an extraordinary man, to be sure, but still a man."],"Paul Verlaine":["Tears fall in my heart like the rain on the town.","I am the Empire at the end of the decadence.","The poet is a madman lost in adventure."],"Paul Virilio":["The speed of light does not merely transform the world. It becomes the world. Globalization is the speed of light.","Images contaminate us like viruses.","Science, which is not so attached to 'truth' as it once was, ut more to immediate 'effectiveness', is now drifting towards a decline, it's civic fall from grace.","War was my university. Everything has proceeded from there.","It will no longer be war that is the continuation of politics by other means, it will be what I have dubbed 'the integral accident' that is the continuation of politics by other means."],"Paul Vixie":["The internet is not for sissies.","You sound like a man with a vision. Care to pass that bong over this way?","It's as if our electric grid didn't even have fences around it. This is disgraceful what we do, and what we don't do, to protect the Internet.","The Internet is no longer the kind of thing where only six guys in the world can build it. Now, you can write a couple of checks and get one of your own."],"Paul Wachter":["Go where you add value. Don't look for places where you're just like everybody else.","Math people are math people. When you approach them with investments and business, they don't just ask the soft questions but eventually get to the hard questions."],"Paul Walker":["I think my mom put it best. She said, 'Little girls soften their daddy's hearts.'","My philosophy is: If you can't have fun, there's no sense in doing it.","Sometimes the hurdles aren't really hurdles at all. They're welcome challenges, tests.","Attitude is attitude, whether you're a West Coast gangster or East Coast gangster, you know?","The mornings along the coast where the fog and mist meet with the salty spray of the seas is one of my favourite smells. I love the smell in the evergreen forest just after it rains - The Redwood Forest in California has the coast, too, so you have the best of everything!","I wish I could be behind the wheel for every stunt.","You know, all that really matters is that the people you love are happy and healthy. Everything else is just sprinkles on the sundae.","Me and my buddies are all like brothers. So it's okay for us to say 'I love you' or whatever. It's always cool. I think that comes from my dad. That's just the way he always was.","I don't care what it is in life: listen to your heart. If you do, no matter what, you win.","I've always wanted to race cars, ever since I was a young boy, as I think a lot of guys have.","Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to be a marine biologist. As you go through the grind and the distraction of a career, it's easy to lose sight of your dreams.","I'm a crazy car guy. I've got an airplane hangar full of cars.","I'm a pretty agile guy, especially being taller and having done martial arts from about the age of 13, but parkour is one of those sports that I wish I'd discovered sooner. When my nephew first showed me, I thought, 'Damn - I'm too old for this.'","I grew up hunting and fishing. I've always been into archery. I've always been into cars... In my family, that was just stuff we did. That's just the way it was.","I like a woman that's capable and at the same time feminine. I admire tomboy qualities but with a feminine touch.","That's one thing about Hollywood. People don't always want what's real. People always want a little more. So for me, it's a compromise. Here you go, that hyper-reality.","I don't go for the flash and panache.","I was definitely ahead of my friends. I was French-kissing girls way before anybody else was.","I live by 'Go big or go home.' That's with everything. It's like either commit and go for it or don't do it at all. I apply that to everything. I apply that to relationships, I apply that to like sports, I apply that to everything. That's what I live by. That's how I like it.","The dream is to have it all. Who says you can't have your cake and eat it too? Live this life, that life, this life, you know? You only live one time - I want to get it all in.","When I was younger, the pressure was just being cool. I never thought of myself as a cool guy. I always thought of myself as more of the goofy guy.","I don't think of myself as a romantic person; I'm kind of more rough and tumble, I think. The things I'm drawn to are outdoorsy, I only get dressed up when I have to. I'm drawn to women who are into the same type of thing. If you're going to call it romantic, I'm very spontaneous. That's probably the best thing I have going for me.","I'm a problem solver. I love people. The more complicated they are, the more I get into them, and I just want to understand what makes them tick.","I want to wake up next to what I went to bed with. I need a girl who can get dressed up to come with me to things, but also one who isn't afraid to get her fingernails dirty or chip her nail polish.","I'm not afraid of anything. That's just the way I am.","I have a way of just being ice and just cooling situations and making things work.","I love long-range rifle shooting. I like anything that deals with precision. I also find that with archery. On my ranch, I have my own range with 3-D targets of animals and hay bales from different distances.","I pack a toothbrush, toothpaste, and deodorant. That's it. I don't have the time or patience for anything else. I'm a natural kind of guy. I don't style my hair - never learned how.","The people I don't understand are atheists. I go surfing and snowboarding, and I'm always around nature. I look at everything and think, 'Who couldn't believe there's a God? Is all this a mistake?' It just blows me away.","I'm Brian a lot more than I'm Paul Walker, which is awesome. When I hear, 'Hey Paul Walker!' my hair stands up on the back of my neck. It's uncomfortable. But when I hear, 'It's Brian!' it's cool. I like Brian.","I love 'Donnie Brasco' and 'Days of Thunder,' so after I did 'The Skulls,' I was like, 'I want to be either an undercover cop, or I want to race cars!' Universal came to me with a newspaper article about street racing in L.A., and I was like, 'Are you kidding me? I grew up doing that right off Peoria in Sun Valley.' They asked if I wanted to do it.","Surfing soothes me, it's always been a kind of Zen experience for me. The ocean is so magnificent, peaceful, and awesome. The rest of the world disappears for me when I'm on a wave.","Surfing big waves is not an extreme sport to me. I fall off, tumble down, and come up. My heart's racing because I'm thinking I almost drowned, and I thank God I can breathe again, but I always think, 'What am I hitting?' Water.","'The Fast' is tough; it's not easy. It represents too much to too many people. But that's what also makes it fun.","I'm not the kind of guy who's taking advantage of my position.","I learned a long time ago that if you subscribe and believe the good, you have to believe the bad. My measure is my heart and what I know.","I wanna work with good people. I don't want to work with screaming, yelling directors who've got daddy issues. I just don't want to deal with those guys.","I'm a science guy. I'm a geek. I love geology and botany and marine science. I thought maybe I'd be a professional guide, or maybe even a park ranger, working for the Department of Fish and Game.","I'd like to live on horseback and just be a cowboy.","I sometimes struggle, because my job is like the antithesis of what surfing is all about. Surfing's simple. It's real.","I thought I was a hippie, bro. I wore Birkenstocks every day. I went to a Christian high school, so I was pretty funky. The teachers didn't give me a hard time, though, even though I was totally way out of line in terms of my dress code.","Everyone has an opinion.","As for Hollywood, I've got a killer job, and I'm having a blast. I have the luxury to go on trips whenever I want and invite my friends who can't afford it. And, God willing, I'll be able to do all that till the day I die.","I want to have the freedom to do whatever I want.","You know, I'm a pretty mellow guy. I'm pretty easy-going. I see everyone's perspective.","I could take you for a walk on the beach and I could point out just about any creature and give you their Latin names.","I remember when I first came around, the computer-generated stuff was pretty wicked. I was like, 'Wow!' but I feel like then for the longest time, we saw so much of it, after a while, you might as well just be watching an animated movie.","I'm not the least bit polished, I come from a blue collar background and I never thought I could feel comfortable around the English.","Thing is, I went to a born-again Christian high school, was brought up in a traditional Mormon family where these ideas about parenting are of structure and sacrifice. To think outside of that idea of family and parenting that I've grown up with is tough but also very freeing.","I fell in love with the ocean when I was just a little kid, four or five years old, I was a junior ranger, I was going out and doing intertidal stuff, walking around and sticking my finger in my first sea anemone and picking up starfish and all that. It gripped me when I was young.","There's a time and place for everything, but as I get older, I like finding those human moments and really connecting. Maybe I'm not as cool as I once was.","I'm a doer, and whether it was the tsunami in Sri Lanka or the earthquake in Indonesia, I was always saying, 'I should be there; I should be helping out.'","There's more to life than movies.","I used to believe in one true soul mate, but not anymore. I believe you can have a few.","Maybe this is just horrible bad, but I think I've had enough successes to where the journey is more important to me now. There's no guarantee, no matter what. We get one run in life.","I really like the Evo from '2Fast.' That car is a lot of fun as a daily driver. They're really quick on the track, too, when they're set up right.","I'm into being a dad, that's where my focus is most of the time. I'm an actor that's my job, but it's not my life. I have a lot of other interests too.","It's not about working anymore, its about doing work I can be proud of.","My parents never looked at my acting as a career. They saw it as a way to help provide for the household.","My motto is, you have to get in a sport a day.","My mom was always really healthy and cautious about her diet, so I'm not a big sugar guy.","I love doing the action stuff. It's soooo much fun!","Basically, you're selling a world as an actor, right? I mean it's like any sales person: if you believe in your product, you know your product, you sell it a lot better.","My mom's hot. I mean she's old, but my mom's out of control.","My family's really close.","My father's a protector. My father's old-school. He's a cowboy.","There's a lot of guys that just get comfortable with their positions and rest on their laurels. I had to earn my way.","If I lost weight, I'd be two-dimensional!","I'm really close to all of my family.","I'm not affected by violence the way some people are. I don't know why, but I enjoy that intensity.","I have an airplane hangar with 17 cars in it. That's no joke. I have a 'half pipe' in there, too - you know, like a big ramp, where I skateboard. It's awesome. It's the ultimate fantasy.","If you spend any time with a man, you'll realize that we're all still little boys.","I hope I'm in a position to make stuff that I really want to make as opposed to stuff that I just have to make for money reasons, or to sustain a certain marquee value.","What I've found recently is the heart, the soul, whatever you want to call it, it doesn't differentiate: If you really live the experience making a movie, it's the same as living it in real life, as crazy as it sounds.","I have friends that are super talented, that are far more talented than I am in certain areas, but it just doesn't happen for them. Sometimes you feel guilty for your success because you know people who deserve it way more.","I almost sabotaged my career. 'The Fast and the Furious' didn't let me, and I'm grateful now. That franchise gave me the opportunity.","One game that drives me crazy, is when a guy gives the girl they really like more attention, and then they feel like maybe they pressed too hard, so they back way off and start giving other women attention. I've never pulled this myself.","When I was younger, I was so damn pretty, I looked like a girl, so I understand why guys didn't like me."],"Paul Waner":["If a pitcher sees you fiddling with the bat, he'll stall until your arms are tired before you even get a chance to hit.","Let the pitcher move first, then, as he draws his arm back, you draw the bat back and you are ready."],"Paul Washer":["One of the greatest attacks of the enemy is to make you busy, to make you hurried, to make you noisy, to make you distracted, to fill the people of God and the Church of God with so much noise and activity that there is no room for prayer. There is no room for being alone with God. There is no room for silence. There is no room for meditation.","The way a woman carries herself and the way she dresses ought to promote the following types of words: modesty, discretion, wisdom, beauty, elegance and refinement, but not sensuality, luxury, extravagance.","If you need me to tell you that if you serve God, you'll get a Mercedes, you're lost.","We know that men are saved by repentance and faith, and whoever does call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. But salvation is a supernatural work of God that will always produce fruit. And the evidence, not the cause, but the evidence of salvation is a changed life, a changing life.","I would submit to you that our greatest need is to rediscover the gospel of Jesus Christ and to proclaim it. I have always said this, especially to the young missionaries that I have dealt with.","There is a power of God for salvation. And it is the gospel of Jesus Christ.","Salvation is by repentance and faith, and if you have truly believed unto salvation, you have been regenerated, which means you have become a new creature, and you are going to live a different life. And so works do not result in salvation.","If Jesus is not enough to motivate you to godly living, you don't know Jesus.","No human being is justified before God or has a right standing before God based upon his own virtue and merit. It is only by faith in the virtue and merit of Christ.","Everyone who believes in Jesus Christ will be saved. That is true.","Missions is not about sending missionaries, and missions is not about doing missions. Missions is about the communication of truth to men.","We need preachers. We need men who believe that this task and women who believe that this task is so great that not all the strategies in the world can make one soul converted.","There is clothing that is improper for a Christian woman.","Women, you need to understand something. Men are not as dumb as you think they are.","There is no such thing as a continuously carnal Christian.","Do Christians sin? Yes, absolutely. But can Christians live in a state of sin without discipline and without being brought back in obedience to their Father? Absolutely not.","I hope not in works. I hope not in ethics. I hope not in baptisms or church membership. I hope in Christ alone.","If you need me to tell you that if you serve God, he'll heal your body and fix every one of your problems, if you need that, you're lost.","One of the things you will notice about the book of Mark is that if you read through it in one setting, you will be breathing hard at the end. Literally, Mark has set up this book in a way that it is almost like several snapshots of Jesus Christ."],"Paul Watford":["I do not believe there are any circumstances in which a judge should consider his or her own values or policy preferences in determining what the law means.","A judge's role is to ensure that the legislature remains within the limits of its assigned authority under the Constitution. Judges have no authority to second-guess the wisdom of the value judgments and policy choices the legislature has made.","As a general rule, I do not think judges should consider current societal preferences when ruling on constitutional challenges.","The Court has long held that the Constitution protects certain fundamental rights that are not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution's text, while at the same time emphasizing that courts must proceed with great caution in recognizing such rights."],"Paul Watson":["Follow your dreams and use your natural-born talents and skills to make this a better world for tomorrow.","The shark is the apex predator in the sea. Sharks have molded evolution for 450 million years. All fish species that are prey to the sharks have had their behavior, their speed, their camouflage, their defense mechanisms molded by the shark.","We buy a bottle of water in the city, where clean water comes out in its taps. You know, back in 1965, if someone said to the average person, 'You know in thirty years you are going to buy water in plastic bottles and pay more for that water than for gasoline?' Everybody would look at you like you're completely out of your mind.","I do what I do because it is the right thing to do. I am a warrior, and it is the way of the warrior to fight superior odds.","We'll lose more species of plants and animals between 2000 and 2065 than we've lost in the last 65 million years. If we don't find answers to these problems, we're gonna be victims of this extinction event that we're at fault for.","Social change comes through people.","All confrontation is based on deception.","The most powerful weapon in the world, as far as I'm concerned, is the camera.","Everybody is a hypocrite. You can't live on this planet without being a hypocrite.","There are very few fishermen left today.","People are beginning to realize that we need to live in accordance with the law of ecology, the law of finite resources, and if we don't, we're going to go extinct.","The environmental movement doesn't have many deserters and has a high level of recruitment. Eventually, there will be open war.","Protesting is fundamentally submissive.","Dutch prisons are probably the most civilized you're going to find anywhere in the world.","I used to swim with these beavers in a beaver pond when I was 10. I went back when I was 11 and found there were no more beavers. I found that trappers had taken them all, so I became quite angry, and that winter I began to walk the trap lines and free animals from the traps and destroy the traps.","Taiwan gives a lot of foreign aid to Costa Rica, so it looks like they are basically buying the right to fish, even though it's not legal.","I did not establish the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society as a protest organisation.","The only language that the Japanese whaling industry understands is economics.","Spermaceti oil is valued for its high resistance to heat, and thus it is used in machinery where there is excessive heat.","The Polynesians used to have a system where they proclaimed a fishing area as 'taboo.' If any fisherman was caught fishing in a taboo area, they would be killed. The Polynesians understand that the fish had to be given a chance to recover.","Immigration is one of the leading contributors to population growth.","The tragedy is that there is so much more incentive - money - to destroy the ecology than there is to preserve it.","NATO isn't going to be concerned about fishing.","Sometimes we are separated by differences, and sometimes we are united by common ideals of respect and compassion.","Way back in October 2007, I had urged thousands of Australians to vote for Kevin Rudd and Peter Garrett's Labor Party. Why? Because they promised to get tough on illegal Japanese whaling.","I have an unexplainable belief that I will never cause harm or be harmed while at sea. Because of this, I feel secure at sea: I feel secure in the ice, I feel secure in the storms, and I feel secure in confrontations.","The only thing scarier than Godzilla is Godzilla's lawyers.","As long as there is a Southern Ocean whale sanctuary, Sea Shepherd crew will continue to patrol and defend it.","My concern is not for the judicial system, but for the reality that the shark fin mafia of Costa Rica has a price on my head, and a Costa Rican prison would provide an excellent opportunity for someone to exercise this lethal contract against me.","Ships are expendable; the whales are not.","Protesting against illegal activity is not piracy.","Documentaries make a difference.","In 'Deadliest Catch,' we have men in ships in rough seas catching crabs. With 'Whale Wars,' we have men and women from a dozen different nations going out to sea in rough weather to help save the whales. We also have icebergs, whales, penguins, and dramatic ship-to-ship confrontations.","My clients are the whales and the seals.","If we wipe out the fish, the oceans are going to die. If the oceans die, we die. We can't live on this planet with a dead ocean.","There's money to be made by driving a species extinct.","I always say, 'I'm not a pirate, I just play one on TV.'","No words can describe the personal liberation that heading seaward bestows upon me. In this aquatic realm, no man or woman is subject to the petty decrees of social bureaucracy.","People feel good about giving money to Greenpeace.","We need to stop flying, stop driving cars and jetting around on marine recreational vehicles.","The fact is, Japan's whaling is illegal, so just because there is a natural disaster in Japan is no reason for us to stop opposing their illegal activities in the Southern Ocean.","I was doing a talk show in Vancouver, and somebody called in a bomb threat to protest my violence, which I thought was pretty strange. We had to evacuate.","You don't get anywhere unless you've had a little bit of a complicated life.","Commercial fishermen are the greediest, stupidest people on earth.","We're close to losing our essential diversity. Look at our wheat crops - we rely on a handful of grain crops and plants that we've refined and bred over hundreds of years.","The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society recognizes that the deaths of four sealers is a tragedy, but Sea Shepherd also recognizes that the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of seal pups is an even greater tragedy.","I've won some awards. 'Time' magazine designated me as one of the environmental heroes of the 20th century. Oh, and I've got some honorary citizenships, like from the Conch Republic of the Florida Keys. But the one thing I am proud of is I didn't get the Chevron environmental award. Never did get that one.","I experienced the California Northridge Earthquake of 1994 and the eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980, and I have thus seen firsthand how terrible and awesomely devastating a force of nature can be.","Does Greenpeace think it can stop whaling in Antarctica by publicly eating whale meat and declaring it delicious? What are these people thinking?","I find it abhorrent to see a whale being slaughtered and do nothing but bear witness.","I will not watch a whale die. I've not seen a whale die since I left Greenpeace in 1977.","Russian subs are a bargain at $60,000. Unfortunately, none of the dials or instructions are in English.","Whales are killed today to supply the limited demand for whale meat or to be used in pet foods or as fodder for fur-bearing animals used in the fur trade.","We live on the most incredible planet, and yet we abuse it, and we abuse it mercilessly.","Killing a baby seal is about the easiest thing you can do if you're inclined to be sadistic; you certainly can't say there's any sport in it - the animal is totally defenceless.","The biggest predator of fish like cod is other fish - and seals keep fish like that in check.","The seal hunt has made me ashamed to be a Canadian.","Greenpeace is the world's largest feel-good organisation now, and I can say that 'cause I am one of their co-founders.","I'm thankful to have time to write.","You will not ever perceive the truth that is reality. There are many realities.","Sometimes going to jail is just the price you have to pay for social reform or social change.","People say I manipulate the media. Well, duh. We live in a media culture, so why on earth wouldn't I?","The United Nations World Charter for Nature, section 21, empowers any nongovernmental organisation or individual to uphold international conservation law in areas beyond national jurisdiction and specifically on the high seas.","The Brer Rabbit ploy has been quite effective for me. When a country is talking about prosecuting me, I demand to be charged and put on trial and offer to pay my own airfare. They know that I'm going to bring a lot of international media with me and put their whaling programme on trial, and they decide it's better to keep quiet and do nothing.","In Ecuador, if I go after an Ecuadoran, I'm in trouble; if I go after a Costa Rican, I'm a hero.","Sea Shepherd does not condone, nor do we practise, violence.","There are many who condemn my crew and I for taking the law into our own hands and for taking on the barons of corporate profit.","I don't see the point in making a distinction between natives having more of a right to kill whales than nonnative people.","There are quite a few disgruntled Greenpeacers who are opposed to its policy of non-cooperation.","Captain Falco saw the diminishment of biodiversity in our oceans over a span of nearly seven decades. He was dedicated to the protection of life and habitats in the sea. He was a legendary mariner, diver, oceanographer, and conservationist. The world is a better place because of him.","Pete Bethune is a hero in New Zealand. He's a hero worldwide to people who want to see the end of whaling.","Greenpeace has a fast ship that could stop the whalers cold.","Nobody can legitimately claim to be a marine ecologist and conservationist while continuing to eat fish. It is the ultimate form of hypocrisy.","Being lampooned on 'South Park' is hardly something to complain about. They brought the issue of the dolphin and whale slaughter by the Japanese to a very large audience. I could not really care less how I was portrayed.","I don't care if I put people off.","I'm never horrible to anybody. My problem, and you can ask any of my friends, is that I'm too nice to everybody.","My grandfather carried me around on his shoulders at 85.","Costa Rica and Germany have simply been pawns in the Japanese quest to silence Sea Shepherd in an attempt to stop our annual opposition of their illegal whaling activities.","I'm not really a fugitive.","The oceans are the last free place on the planet.","Canada I don't trust. The Canadian government hates me more than the Japanese.","I want to stay in the ocean. I'm not going to be able to do that from some holding cell in Japan.","There's no rest when you're on planetary duty.","I don't eat fish because there is no such thing as sustainable fishing in the world right now.","I have been honoured to serve the whales, dolphins, seals - and all the other creatures on this Earth. Their beauty, intelligence, strength, and spirit have inspired me.","The sealing industry is dying.","I feel that we have a responsibility to try to do everything we can to protect species, and the best way to do that is to uphold international conservation law.","I'm not interested in culture; I'm interested in the law.","Putting Zodiacs in front of whaling vessels doesn't do it anymore. Done that, been there, seen that.","I would just say that nobody could do what I do unless you had a big ego. It's the only way you can really put it. You have to be arrogant enough to challenge the arrogance of the human race.","I wouldn't think I was successful if I didn't have just as many people hate me as support me.","No species is more important than others.","I'm not pessimistic about anything.","I have never suffered under any delusion that saving the whales in the Antarctic sanctuary would be easy, but the one thing I am certain of is that I and my passionate crew of international volunteers will never quit defending life in the seas from poachers, no matter what consequences we must endure to do so.","All revolutions are violent revolutions.","People sometimes feel frustrated about what's going on in our oceans and environment, and 'Whale Wars' shows that ordinary people can take action and make things happen.","Nobody has ever been hurt by the actions of ships I have been on.","Most people can't see the connection between their own lives and the oceans.","Usually, environmental programs are not designed for a mainstream audience.","I don't think you really have to retire from what you do.","Sustainable fishing is a fraud. It's a marketing term that really means 'business as usual.'","Every fish in the ocean is in danger.","The film 'The Cove' made people aware of the Japanese slaughter of whales.","In December 2012, the U.S. 9th district court granted a temporary injunction to the Japanese whalers that ordered the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society U.S.A. to not approach within 500 yards of the whaling vessels.","If you're dealing with criminals, they're not going to want to go to court.","To me extremism is targeting endangered whales in a whale sanctuary in violation of a moratorium. That, to me, is extreme.","I've had a lot of disappointments. I think my biggest disappointment is the failure of elected officials to make good on their promises in regards to the environment or anything else, really. I have very little faith in politicians.","A fish is more valuable swimming in the sea maintaining the integrity of oceanic eco-systems than it is on anyone's plate.","I have actually led more expeditions to Antarctica than Scott, Amundsen, and Shackleton put together.","I don't think that any government has a right to subvert the truth or to cover up the truth, and all I see WikiLeaks doing is exposing the truth.","That's the thing with celebrities: the media can't ignore them.","When I hear so-called professional journalists ask why we have celebrities speak for us and for the animals, the environment or social causes, I marvel at their denial of the rules of their own trade.","I don't have a religion, but I respect them.","An American citizen is not going to be extradited to Japan for saving whales.","Bluefin tuna is sort of like the cheetah of the ocean. It's the fastest fish. It's a warm-blooded fish. But it's got a $100,000 price tag on its head.","Domestic house cats kill more fish than all the world's seals put together.","In 1993, I chased Cuban and Spanish drag trawlers off the Grand Banks off of Newfoundland. And it cost them $35 million in losses.","It's a war, I think, to save the planet, really, from ourselves.","I take a biocentric point of view. I look at things from the point of view of the Earth and the laws of ecology. As opposed to the anthropocentric point of view, where everything revolves around humanity.","When I was born, there were three billion people on the planet.","I feel that people should have a license to have children, that they have proper education how to raise children. And that nobody should be allowed to be a parent unless they can prove that they are competent enough to be a parent.","I always try to take the unexpected things and make them work for me.","Actually, I never really look at myself as a real radical activist; I am more the conservative. I mean, the conservatives are trying to conserve; the radicals are destroying the planet.","Any social movement throughout history has always been carried out by only 7% of population being passionately active in that.","Here's the thing: Nobody gets extradited for a crime where nobody's been hurt, where no property's been damaged.","It is true that many of the Sea Shepherd crewmembers are inexperienced, but the fact is that these volunteers bring a passion to the project that cannot be found in a hired crew.","In Africa, the rangers shoot poachers.","The Sea Shepherd crew is doing what governments should be doing, but refuse to do themselves, because of the threats of trade retaliation from Japan.","Ecoterrorism is terrorism against the environment.","Japan is a bully nation that takes what it wants and threatens any who oppose it.","I have known Farley Mowat all of my life, from reading his books as a child to becoming a close friend of his over the last three decades.","Sea Shepherd is to terrorism what Groucho was to Marxism."],"Paul Watzlawick":["The belief that one's own view of reality is the only reality is the most dangerous of all delusions.","A self-fulfilling prophecy is an assumption or prediction that, purely as a result of having been made, cause the expected or predicted event to occur and thus confirms its own 'accuracy.'","Radical constructivism, thus, is radical because it breaks with convention and develops a theory of knowledge in which knowledge does not reflect an 'objective' ontological reality.","It is difficult to imagine how any behavior in the presence of another person can avoid being a communication of one's own view of the nature of one's relationship with that person and how it can fail to influence that person.","In other words, what is supposedly found is an invention whose inventor is unaware of his act of invention, who considers it as something that exists independently of him; the invention then becomes the basis of his world view and actions.","Above all, in comedy, and again and again since classical times, passages can be found in which the level of representation is interrupted by references to the spectators or to the fictive nature of the play.","The suicide arrives at the conclusion that what he is seeking does not exist; the seeker concludes that what he has not yet looked in the right place.","This is the secret of propaganda: To totally saturate the person, whom the propaganda wants to lay hold of, with the ideas of the propaganda, without him even noticing that he is being saturated.","The counterpart of the suicide is the seeker; but the difference between them is slight."],"Paul Weller":["I don't think about what I can't do or what I shouldn't be doing. I just think there are endless possibilities musically, really.","You can't live a lie. You have to follow your heart.","I don't like the royal family, I don't like the establishment, I don't like the civil service.","Right from the start with music, I was like, 'I'm just going to do this, and I don't care about anything else. There are certain things you have to give up, even at 13, 14: your Friday and Saturday nights, having a regular girl, lots of things like that. I look at Amy Winehouse, and I think perhaps she just don't want to do it that much.","Playing music is a lifetime's work. And if you want to carry on with it, you have to try to better yourself. You have to see where the music can take you.","Pop music was supposed to be a flash in the pan, but here we are 50 years later and it means something to us, and it always will do. It's incredibly important.","We can't stop a baby in Africa from starving to death... but we can afford enough technology and weaponry to blow the world up a million times over.","The Jam went through a phase of wearing satin jackets. But that was pre-getting signed and making it, when we were still playing the pubs and clubs - around '75. Shocking, really - what would you call them apart from 'horrible?' We'd wear these white zip-up bomber jackets with black kind of loon pants and black and white shoes.","The first thing I bought that was really stylish was in 1969 when I was eleven. I saved up for a black, grey and white tie-dye grandad vest. It was too big - they weren't catering for kids my age - and hung off me, but I loved it.","People say that if you're still angry at 52, you're not an angry young man, just a grumpy old git.","The Jam were a good band, however I feel that the Style Council were better. A lot of people I know will disagree with me. Some things we did with The Style Council were misinterpreted or over their heads.","I had a total belief in The Style Council. I meant every word and felt every action.","'Ageism,' or whatever you want to call it, is a very English phenomenon. You don't get it too much in many other cultures. And no one says it about authors or poets or filmmakers. 'Oh, they're too old to make films or write books.'","I want to see where and how far I can go as an artist. I look back and see what I've done, and I want to do as much as I can in my lifetime. I love doing it. If I didn't have that passion or love for it, I wouldn't do it.","I take my hat off to people like the Stones, but it's not for me. I couldn't do that. Jagger is brilliant and long may he rock. I couldn't make my career out of old songs; it would do my head in.","I'm so lucky, I'm just really grateful for what I've got around me - children and my wife and everything else.","When I'm dead, I wanna leave a body of work, like authors or great painters do.","I wear jeans and a T-shirt sometimes. I just like clothes - since the first time I can remember, like age ten or eleven; I was just obsessed with music and clothes. Just like a lot of people in England from my generation.","I don't think about what I can't do or what I shouldn't be doing. I just think there are endless possibilities musically, really. And I'm very, very open to experimenting with different people and trying to find different methods of writing and making music.","Music is the most natural thing in the world. When we go to a gig and we all like it and we share that experience, it's the same sense of communion as a sacred rite in Borneo or wherever it may be; it just gets dressed up different. Its good for the soul.","There were aspects of stardom I didn't like, which were of no consequence, really, but the positive things far outweighed the negative. By the time I came to write 'Setting Sons,' I felt my writing was more like prose, set to music.","I'm always looking for something. Not in an unhappy way. I just like to try different things. I don't want to be morbid, but I'm not getting any younger.","When I lived in a little flat in Pimlico in 1981, I'd write in the hallway. As you walked in, there was a tiny little recess type thing, hardly a hallway, really, and I'd sit there writing songs with my guitar.","There are so many artists who get to my age that get comfortable and just stick in a groove, and I really don't want to do that.","I think politicians are so far out of step with what people really want.","I think people are just really disappointed, disappointed with Blair as well, who's just like Bush's lapdog. I think everyone's just disillusioned with politics in our country, and it must be the same in your country.","Everyone gets frustrated and aggressive, and I'd sooner take my aggression out on a guitar than on a person.","I don't really wanna talk about politics, I'm not clever enough.","Nothing wrong with pop!","I get labelled as just being about one thing, but there's lots of layers to what I do.","I want to hear as much music as I possibly can before I leave this mortal coil but it's impossible to hear it all because there's so much of it.","I could write songs about politics, but I'm conscious of not writing songs that sound the same as the ones I wrote 30 years ago.","I've not had Botox, no.","Being a musician is a noble profession.","In all honesty, I don't know what one song can change.","I really enjoy playing America. I like the audiences there. It's the home of a lot of music I grew up with.","Most people my age, their musical life ended in the '80s. They stick with what they know. But my tastes are much broader. And I don't want to stop learning.","In my old age, my mind gets more open, and I listen to so many different types of music and I guess that all reflects in my work.","I still love playing music. It was all I ever wanted to do, and I got the chance to do it.","I think I come from a time when all the artists I grew up with and I loved always used to try and push the boundaries, and there doesn't seem so much of that, really.","It is nice to make a record and people like it, and it's encouraging.","I never saw myself as a spokesman for a generation. It was all a bit heavy for me. I saw myself as a songwriter and wrote for myself, which I still do, and I also wanted to communicate with my audience.","I suppose I was much more serious-minded in the '70s and '80s.","Going to college was never an option. I was passionate about music, but how much talent I actually had was another matter.","Coming from a little suburban town, I wasn't a hip city kid. I was quite the opposite, really. Songs like 'Saturday's Kids' rang a bell for kids all over the country. That song was about the kids I grew up with.","I'm very, very open to experimenting with different people and trying to find different methods of writing and making music.","I'm fine with being thought of as a guitar player, and if I can get any recognition or respect for doing that, that's a pretty good thing for me.","When I listen to a record, or when I'm making a record, I listen to everything. I listen to the drums, the bass, the voice, the arrangement. I listen to the whole piece as an ensemble.","There was a time in my 40s where I thought, oh, it's all over - not just work, but I'm never going to feel young again, I'm always going to feel like I know what's going to happen, I'll know what to expect. Looking back I don't know if that was a midlife crisis, I don't know - but I don't feel that now. There's possibilities. It gets better.","I think, with age, you learn that it comes in bursts and you've got no control over it. I'm not one of those people who says, 'I've got to write a song every day.' I just store up ideas, and really I have to wait until it finds me; I know when I'm ready to write. It used to frustrate me, but it doesn't any more. It's just how it is.","The Zombies were really unique - they had elements of jazz and classical music in their songs and songwriting. They had a very, very different sound compared to a lot of their contemporaries at the time.","If you're into a certain band, you're into the way they dress.","Led Zeppelin would never have reformed if he or Jimmy Page were bald.","Of course I'm proud of what I've done, but I'm interested in what's next. I want to be relevant now, in 2012. I've done my bit for the past. I've only ever been about what's next, really, and I'll be that way until I keel over.","I kept the first Rickenbacker I ever got, a little short-scale John Lennon-type model. And I've got a couple of 12-string models, which are really nice, and I've got a Pete Townshend model, which Pete gave me a few years ago. But that's about it.","When I listen to a record, or when I'm making a record, I listen to everything. I listen to the drums, the bass, the voice, the arrangement. I listen to the whole piece as an ensemble. I don't only listen to the guitar player.","People say you make your best work when you're in despair and all that, and at your lowest - but for me, I think happiness makes you positive, and I think that's a good creative place to write from.","I get labelled as just being about one thing, but there's lots of layers to what I do. It's just lazy journalism, but people start to accept it. If people spent an hour in my car driving around London and listening to the stuff I listen to, they'd hear some interesting stuff.","When I got into the Beatles, I must have only been about six or seven but old enough to take notice. We used to have an old radiogram which, for readers of a certain age, was like a big cabinet thing with a record player inside it.","I hear an album so many times during the course of making it that when I've just finished it, I don't want to hear it again. After you've taken a little bit of time away from it, you can come back to it, which can be scary. I'm happy with 'Sonik Kicks,' man.","I've always had self-belief, though my sensitive side has never been fully appreciated. For every 'Down in the Tube Station at Midnight,' I've written an 'English Rose.' People forget.","I've always liked my clothes, even before I could properly afford them. Clothes for me were never a cloak, a cover. They were how I chose to express myself.","I'm not big on rap, to be honest. I just don't get it. It's angry people shouting. I like a song, melodies, people singing.","The only time I ever really got into rap was back in the early '90s, and bands like A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, Gang Starr. Musically, they were really interesting. But when hip-hop acts start sampling Sting or Phil Collins, then I just don't get it at all.","I am aware of the words 'national treasure' being attached to me occasionally. It just makes me feel old.","There have been records I've been really, really pleased with that haven't connected with people. But I felt good about them.","If you're making music, you must want to turn other people on to it, whether you're number one in the charts or number 60. I don't know, that's a commercial thing, but just the fact that other people like you... there's no point in making music, otherwise. Otherwise, you might as well make it in your bedroom and leave it there.","I was always taught as a kid that if there's anything you want in life, you've got to work towards it. I guess that sort of stayed with me, really. But also, for me, from the time I was, like, 10 years old, all I ever wanted to do was be in a band and make music.","It's quite liberating to get to a certain age, 'cos you're not chasing number one hits or trying to be an international superstar. I've done all that. I'm not out to prove much more to anyone but myself really, to be an artist and see if there is a new undiscovered music out there for me to make.","When I told my mum I was going to play my first gig when I was 14, she couldn't believe it, cause I was painfully shy at that time. But I just done it, put my head down and got through it. And I suppose there's still a little bit of that, even though it's many years later and I've been doing it for a long time.","There is a shy side to me that evaporates when I play on stage, and I like that. I think it's another facet of my character, and I need to do that.","I was such a massive fan of all the '60s pop bands, but if I had to single out one band, it would definitely be The Beatles.","In the '90s, I think I rediscovered my guitar. The Jam was obviously very guitar-based, but in the Style Council I just got really disillusioned with playing the guitar. The further it went on, the less and less I played, to a point where I couldn't pick it up any more.","For me, the best thing I can do is play live. The best way for me to put over what I'm trying to do is to play live. Whether it's an acoustic show, electric or whatever... if I shine at all, that's where it all really happens - it just took me a while to rediscover that.","I've bought clothes based on record covers. Particularly from the formative music that turned me onto it in the first place when I was a kid, with the Beatles and the Small Faces. A lot of those Sixties soul artists were in really sharp sharkskin or mohair suits, and Motown artists looked amazing.","No man should have cowboys boots in his wardrobe. That's fair enough, isn't it? Unless you're a cowboy, of course.","When I'm dead, I wanna leave a body of work, like authors or great painters do. I don't wanna get ideas above my station, but why shouldn't this be comparable? Pop music was supposed to be a flash in the pan, but here we are 50 years later, and it means something to us, and it always will do. It's incredibly important.","You have to keep challenging yourself. I've always tried to do that, and I'm not saying I've always been successful. Maybe I've rewritten the same song; it's inevitable, but I've always been mindful of taking the writing somewhere else. You can't stick in your little comfort zone.","I'm sure there's a subconscious 'go for it' thing with turning 50. You want to do as much as possible and there are thoughts of how little time we have on the planet. For a lot of musicians in their 50s, the best days are behind them. I'd like to try and show that there is a future.","All my children inspire me in life, and that always comes out in the writing.","I'd heard a lot of Motown and Stax when I was a kid, but the more well-known end of it. On Jam tours, we had a DJ called Ady Croasdell who ran a '60s club. He turned me on to underground stuff and what people call northern soul. It just blew my mind.","I come from a time when every kid dressed up. Everybody. If you didn't, you wouldn't be able to hang out. It was very tribal. There's nice things in that. It's culture; it's roots for me.","When I was a kid in Woking, every week you went to the football dance, and every week the top kids would be wearing something different. You were constantly trying to catch up with them - which you could never do because, by the time you'd saved up enough to buy the item, they'd moved on to something else. That's the whole Mod thing, I suppose.","I never, ever wanted to be the Rolling Stones. Bless their hearts, but I don't necessarily want to go on doing the same old thing for the next 10, 20 years... I could see how easy it is to get into that rut, the whole touring mindset.","I'd like to think I've left something in the world. Without in any way trying to be morbid, but life is very short, and I'd like to think I'd leave some body of work that would inspire other musicians long after I've gone.","No one told Miles Davis or BB King to pack it in. John Lee Hooker played literally up to the day he died. Why should pop musicians be any different?","I didn't imagine getting to 50, let alone still be playing music. When I was 18, I thought it'd all be over by the time I was 21.","Getting to No. 1 makes everyone feel better; of course it does. But it's swings and roundabouts with these things. Sometimes you make a great record, and it clicks with people. And other times it passes them by; there's nothing you can do. It's still the same record.","Playing live is what it's all about for me. It's cathartic, it's emotional, it's about communing with people. The way you feel after a gig is a such a powerful thing."],"Paul Wellstone":["Our aims in political activism are not, and should not be, to create a perfect utopia.","We all do better when we all do better.","Sometimes, the only realists are the dreamers.","Successful organizing is based on the recognition that people get organized because they, too, have a vision.","There are three critical ingredients to democratic renewal and progressive change in America: good public policy, grassroots organizing and electoral politics.","The idea of democracy has been stripped of it moral imperatives and come to denote hollowness and hypocrisy.","Politics is about the improvement of people's lives. It's about advancing the cause of peace and justice in our country and the world. Politics is about doing well for the people.","Never separate the life you live from the words you speak.","I saw as a teacher how, if you take that spark of learning that those children have, and you ignite it, you can take a child from any background to a lifetime of creativity and accomplishment.","Our politics are our deepest form of expression: they mirror our past experiences and reflect our dreams and aspirations for the future.","I emphasize self-esteem, self-confidence, and dignity, not as an ideal, but as a real test of community organization. Without leadership development, community organizations do not have staying power.","The future will belong to those who have passion and are willing to work hard to make our country better.","A politics that is not sensitive to the concerns and circumstances of people's lives, a politics that does not speak to and include people, is an intellectually arrogant politics that deserves to fail.","Education and democracy have the same goal: the fullest possible development of human capabilities.","I don't think politics has anything to do with left, right, or center. It has to do with trying to do right by people.","I think the future also will not belong to those who are cynical or those who stand on the sidelines.","I'm short, I'm Jewish and I'm a liberal.","If we don't fight hard enough for the things we stand for, at some point we have to recognize that we don't really stand for them.","Politics is not predictions and politics is not observations. Politics is what we do. Politics is what we do, politics is what we create, by what we work for, by what we hope for and what we dare to imagine.","The American polity is infected with a serious imbalance of power between elites and masses, a power which is the principal threat to our democracy.","Politics isn't about big money or power games; it's about the improvement of people's lives.","Above and beyond the question of how to grow the economy there is a legitimate concern about how to grow the quality of our lives.","As free citizens in a political democracy, we have a responsibility to be interested and involved in the affairs of the human community, be it at the local or the global level.","I represent the Democratic wing of the Democratic party.","I was talking about no nukes, the farm crisis. People said that wasn't stuff that a state auditor was supposed to be talking about. Maybe they were right.","If a teacher does not involve himself, his values, his commitments, in the course of discussion, why should the students?","It is the belief that extremes and excesses of inequality must be reduced so that each person is free to fully develop his or her full potential. This is why we take precious time out of our lives and give it to politics.","Politics is not about money.","Politics is not about power.","Politics is not about winning for the sake of winning.","The first task in teaching is to bring to consciousness what the students already believe by virtue of their personal experiences about themselves and society.","The kind of national goal we ought to be thinking about is way beyond national product - it is how do we as a nation help our children be the best kinds of people they could possibly be?","The only way to change is to vote. People are responsible.","The people of this country, not special interest big money, should be the source of all political power.","There is a major ingredient missing from our perception of how changes are brought about; that ingredient is power.","We can and must move U.S. politics forward by means of committed participation.","We can remake the world daily.","What makes community organizing especially attractive is the faith it places in the ability of the poor to make decisions for themselves.","What the poor, the weak, and the inarticulate desperately require is power, organization, and a sense of identity and purpose, not rarefied advice of political scientists.","When too many Americans don't vote or participate, some see apathy and despair. I see disappointment and even outrage. And I believe that out of this frustration can come hope and action.","Without trying, I'm different.","Why don't we call on the credit card companies to be accountable? They need to be held accountable for their predatory lending practices."],"Paul Wesley":["I think any girl would throw me under a bus to be within five feet of Robert Pattinson. I actually think he's an attractive guy. And I watched most of 'Twilight,' and I think he was really intriguing.","When I was 18 I was just absorbing everything around me: whatever happens, happens. I was so naive and willing to ride whatever wave life threw at me.","The thing I love about being an actor is the ability to travel and experience new cultures.","I wasn't some weird loner in school, but I definitely wasn't invited to any of the cool parties.","What doesn't confuse me about what women wear? When it comes to women's fashion I'm so oblivious. I have no idea what's going on.","I don't have television so I don't watch TV.","I'm pretty neurotic.","I think any time anybody sees the bad guy show emotion and you're not hitting the audience over the head, there's always a tinge of empathy for that individual.","I've had cameos on some cool shows.","I played ice hockey obsessively for 14 years of my life.","'Catcher in the Rye' changed my life when I was a kid. I read it as I was a boy turning into a man, and I was so fascinated by the values. I believe in it."],"Paul Westerberg":["The hack songwriter will write the absolute truth every single word, whether it makes a great song or not.","So I figured in keeping with the record, I'd do something off the wall which is show up for free and wing it... I don't know, I'm just going to play some songs. I think it'll be fun.","It's my first record since my son is old enough to understand and I can't even show it to him. Yes, it's affected me, probably in the opposite of how anyone would have thought.","It's fun, but the fun is where it always was. I mean, it's still fun to strap on my Les Paul in the basement and turn up the Marshall amp. I'm still 15. I still enjoy that as much as I ever did.","I have my own language and it's high time I put a little of it out there.","Actually, I've done it the other way so many times where you rehearse the band and you do the whole thing with lights, the show and the crew - everything. Then you see what happens and you're already committed to dates. I'm just sort of putting out feelers this way.","Reading music is like listening to flowers. I don't understand the concept.","You know, he likes me because I'm his son. I have to go long and far to find someone who knows me just as me, rather than me the songwriter or whatever.","Then again, I think about high school every day and I think about being a little kid every day too.","The best I can say is that it's better for me to write about despair and darkness than to be incapable of getting off the sofa. It's better to write about suicide than to contemplate it too heavily.","Stick with your heart and you'll be fine.","Right now, it hasn't affected my music other than the fact that I don't have time to write any of it. That's no different from when I first started and I lived at home. I would play the guitar in the afternoon and then my mom or my dad would come home and I'd have to quit.","Oddly, when I started to make the record, I wasn't aware I was making a record. I just was sort of disgusted with the whole thing and sequestered myself in the basement and started playing the piano just for something to do.","It's like, it's up to the people to fall in love with the song. The record company can only do so much.","I've had more people in my life take their lives than... I think it's out of proportion with most people. I think a lot of them gravitate towards me because of the music.","I'm not dissatisfied with my place in it rock 'n' roll.","I'm hard-pressed to think of a lot of great rock movies.","I'm beyond caring what anyone expects of me anymore.","I think of the Replacements only when they're brought up to me. For two years, I'm at home, they don't really cross my mind. I still hear them on the radio. I'm not ashamed of anything we did.","I think it should be evident by now, but I'm as lost as anyone.","I sat through Ladies and Gentlemen, the Rolling Stones like three times at the Skyway when it came out.","I read The Bell Jar, and then I read her memoir and her diaries, and a third book, an outside opinion. Just the way she made the pillows so neat on the oven door. It just seems to be the opposite of, if you're going to take your life, in a horrible rage it happens.","I forever felt that I've fallen right between the crack of way too young for the first generation of classic rock 'n' roll and too old to be brand-new. It's hard.","I don't think there's anything that will make me stop doing it. There may be a time when it's not available to anyone. You may have to come listen at my basement window... but I can't stop.","I didn't wake up one morning and not be in the Replacements. We're all that forever, and I've just grown older. I mean, I haven't lost anything. I've gained a few things.","Any musician who can stop may be a musician, but they're no artist. If it's in your blood, it can't stop flowing.","Although, my experience when I've been depressed, not only am I too depressed to sit down and write a song, I'm too depressed to pick up my feet. So if you can at least write about it, you're halfway away from it.","The truth is overrated.","A rock'n'roll band needs to be able to get under people's skin.

Similarly, we weren't about to impose a dictatorship in Iraq having liberated the country.","Someone once said that history has more imagination than all the scenario writers in the Pentagon, and we have a lot of scenario writers here. No one ever wrote a scenario for commercial airliners crashing into the World Trade Center.","I think one has to say it's not just simply a matter of capturing people and holding them accountable, but removing the sanctuaries, removing the support systems, ending states who sponsor terrorism. And that's why it has to be a broad and sustained campaign.","One of the things that ultimately led me to leave mathematics and go into political science was thinking I could prevent nuclear war.","We did not go to war in Afghanistan or in Iraq to, quote, 'impose democracy.' We went to war in both places because we saw those regimes as a threat to the United States.","History is just littered with problems that were solved that were supposed to be impossible.","Support for peaceful reform by the people themselves is the right way to promote democracy, not the use of force.","We don't start a job that we can't finish... that's the American way.","I think all foreigners should stop interfering in the internal affairs of Iraq. Those who want to come and help are welcome. Those who come to interfere and destroy are not.","Public action should seek to expand the set of opportunities of those who have the least voice and fewest resources and capabilities.","Jobs are a priority for every country. Doing more to improve regulation and help entrepreneurs is the key to creating jobs - and more growth.","I've met quite a few dictators up close and personal in my life.","I certainly don't like a label that suggests I believe that the military is the solution to most of the world's problems.","Poles understand perhaps better than anyone the consequences of making toothless warnings to brutal tyrants and terrorist regimes.","That sense of what happened in Europe in World War II has shaped a lot of my views.","It's a very bad thing when people exterminate other people, and people persecute minorities.","It's wonderful that so many people want to contribute to fighting aids or malaria. But, if somebody isn't paying attention to the overall health system in the country, a whole lot of money can be wasted.","I told my father I had to try political science for a year. He thought I was throwing my life away.","I think, in the longer view of things, there is a very powerful pull in the direction of participatory government.","If greater openness is a key to economic success, I believe there is increasingly a need for openness in the political sphere as well.","For the private sector to flourish, special privilege must give way to equal opportunity and equal risk for all.","The cost of the high-cost economy remains too high.","Look, I think the public generally understands that what's at stake in Afghanistan is American security, number one.","I think it's a mistake to rely too much on any one economic factor. It's why investors try to spread their portfolio round.","The most striking thing is that even before Osama bin Laden was killed, he seemed largely irrelevant to the Arab Spring.","The absence of Saddam is a huge weight off the Arab world.","Democracy is a process.","I'm constantly asking for alternative views on most things that come to me.","For one thing I tend not to see myself in various moulds that people fit me into.","I think that all countries that participate in multilateral institutions see the institutions as a way of advancing what they view as their national interests and they see in many cases multi-lateral institution as the best way to do that.","It is kind of nice to have a common purpose.","I have always had a tendency to keep enlarging problems which I personally think is the way the world works... that seeing anything one dimensionally on the kinds of political, sort of big issues of human progress is going to be a distorted view of things, which is why over my career I have gone seemingly from subject to subject to subject.","Generally speaking, the stronger the connection between the financing and the ultimate beneficiary, the better the result.","I'm not sure the oil producers are enjoying real growth. That troubles me. For experience has shown that oil can be more of a curse than a blessing. And not only in Africa.","You can't be involved in healthcare without being involved in the battle against AIDS.","Before September 11, terrorism was viewed as something ugly but you lived with it.","The internal affairs of other countries has a big impact on American interests.","Look, I think the notion that there's a dogma or doctrine of foreign policy that gives you a textbook recipe for how to react to all situations is really nonsense.","The American people are pretty impressive in their ability to keep after something if they think it is doable.","Part of what is wrong with the view of American imperialism is that it is antithetical to our interests. We are better off when people are governing themselves. I'm sure there is some guy that will tell you that philosophy is no different from the Roman Empire's. Well, it is fundamentally different.","The use of force to liberate people is very different from the use of force to suppress or control them, or even to defeat them.","China, in the future, is going to have even more nuclear capability than it has had in the past. I don't believe that they have anything to fear from the United States, and I frankly don't believe they do fear the United States.","I can't predict the future."],"Paul Wood":["War damages men - and Syria is no different.","In all the towns and villages it controls, ISIS has implemented its very conservative version of Sharia. Rules on appearance are strictly enforced: a beard for men, the full veil for women. This is required for the whole population.","The jihadists of ISIS wish to go back to what they see as a more pure form of Islam from the time of the Prophet and his companions. They believe in a literal interpretation of the Koran.","Nobody should believe something just because an intelligence agent says it.","There are now two Syrias. One is run by men who fight for God, not democracy. The other is ruled by a secular but authoritarian regime accused of many crimes against its people. The choice between the two will not be decided at the polls."],"Paul Zane Pilzer":["The early pioneers of both wellness and network marketing were motivated by the sense that it was possible to create a better life than the conventional routes offered - better personal health and better economic health, respectively. Now the 'alternatives' of yesterday have become the economic powerhouses of today and tomorrow.","God wants us to show compassion and understanding toward the unemployed or the poor not because they are poor, but because poor people, with help from those who are already successful, can become rich. And when the poor become rich, all will benefit, because in our modern economy new unemployment is the first sign of economic growth.","Hold on to your dream. Don't let past failures or dire economic forecasts make you a pessimist. Keep your youthful dreams alive and create your own opportunities.","I realized that, when you're 18, your world is wide open. But as each year passes, one more nail goes into the coffin, killing you dreams and aspirations. And by the time you reach 25, you've been beaten down and become a realist. And my advice is you can't let these things get you down.","The erroneous economic belief in scarcity leads directly to the mistaken theological belief that God does not want us to be rich. After all, in a world of scarce physical resources, a person could achieve personal wealth only by taking wealth from another - something that a truly benevolent, loving God would never allow.","The incorrect supposition that we live in a world of scarce resources has done more than preclude most individuals from achieving economic success. Over the centuries, this zero-sum-game view of the world has been responsible for wars, revolutions, political strategies, and human suffering of unfathomable proportions.","I like the honesty about direct selling because it openly tells people the way to get rich is residual income: Get paid tomorrow for something you did yesterday - and let it accumulate.","Your employer is the last person you should want to provide for your healthcare, from a privacy, financial, and value standpoint. Employees with families should get the family, meaning spouses and children, off the company plan. In most cases, that will save them money.","I feel I'm doing God's work switching people from group plans to individual insurance.","Unlike every other retirement vehicle, such as IRAs and 401(k)s, you receive a tax deduction for making contributions to your HSA but don't have to pay income taxes on withdrawals.","Since 1975, when I entered the Wharton Graduate School, I have belonged to a small group of economists who believe that the world does not contain a limited amount of physical resources. Quite the contrary, I believe that the world is a virtual cornucopia of physical resources.","Tens of millions of Americans are modern-day slaves - unable to retire early, or working in jobs they don't really want, just for the health insurance they need to take care of themselves, a spouse, or a child with a 'preexisting condition.'","You have to be passionate about your business. If you don't love your business, you are doing a terrible disservice to your customers and clients, your team members and business partners, your family and yourself.","Many people are looking to Washington for answers, but I'm here to tell you, if we wait for the politicians to solve the problems of our day, we will be waiting a long time.","Entrepreneurs, by their nature, see not only problems but solutions and opportunities.","When most people are unhappy customers, they get mad; I try to get rich. All of my businesses started the same way: I got rich by improving the world and making a lot of people happier in the process.","Companies become rich because they find a way to serve others better. And if someone at your company is not serving your customers, it hurts more than your company; it hurts America.","If you look back through history, you'll see that God, in any form - Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed - has always wanted prosperity for everyone. There was a recognition of the need to integrate our material and spiritual lives. But that message was distorted by various leaders with their own agendas."],"Paul de Man":["Death is a displaced name for a linguistic predicament.","Modernity exists in the form of a desire to wipe out whatever came earlier, in the hope of reaching at least a point that could be called a true present, a point of origin that marks a new departure.","Fashion is like the ashes left behind by the uniquely shaped flames of the fire, the trace alone revealing that a fire actually took place.","Metaphors are much more tenacious than facts.","The ambivalence of writing is such that it can be considered both an act and an interpretive process that follows after an act with which it cannot coincide. As such, it both affirms and denies its own nature.","Curiously enough, it seems to be only in describing a mode of language which does not mean what it says that one can actually say what one means.","The writer's language is to some degree the product of his own action; he is both the historian and the agent of his own language.","Literature exists at the same time in the modes of error and truth; it both betrays and obeys its own mode of being.","The critical method which denies literary modernity would appear - and even, in certain respects, would be - the most modern of critical movements."],"Paul von Hindenburg":["All we know is that, at times, fighting the Russians, we had to remove the piles of enemy bodies from before our trenches, so as to get a clear field of fire against new waves of assault.","I believed that our own public would keep this in mind even in this serious crisis, and stand firm if only we at the front continued to stand firm too.","However, the fact that the tanks had now been raised to such a pitch of technical perfection that they could cross our undamaged trenches and obstacles did not fail to have a marked effect on our troops.","In the account book of the Great War the page recording the Russian losses has been ripped out. The figures are unknown. Five millions, or eight? We ourselves know not.","I also believed that our public at home would be strong enough to survive even the present crisis.","It does not seem to me to be sufficiently recognized everywhere among the officials that the existence or non-existence of our people and Empire is at stake.","It is impossible for our working people to maintain their full strength if they do not succeed in obtaining a sufficient supply of fat, allotted to them on a proper basis.","In spite of certain distressing but isolated occurrences in the last battle, I certainly hoped that the Army would be in a position to continue to hold out."],"Paula Abdul":["Keep the faith, don't lose your perseverance and always trust your gut extinct.","Everyone is your best friend when you are successful.

There's a lot of emperor's new clothes out there, whether they're female or male solo acts. That bothers me. It's hard to break through, and it's like climbing Mount Everest if you actually do.","I like doing the crossword puzzle in the New York Times, not watching E! on TV.","So I'm writing more highly personalized and intellectual music, and I think that's good.

I use my credit cards, so I don't need to do that.","I think I do my own thing. I start my own trends. I see a lot of girls doing what I've been doing. Pink. Nobody wore pink, and now everybody wears it. It's flattering.","We are a global sport. I mean, golf is obviously played all around the world. But when you have your National Championship, of course, everybody in America is rooting for an American.","An American champion, obviously being here in the states, is something that we all look at with the U.S. Open. But golf is played all over the world, and there are so many great golfers from other countries, and we're lucky enough that this is our home base to be able to play out of.","Every woman should recruit a female friend to take up golf so there will be more women available to play.","Women in pro-ams are always telling me about all the business deals they've struck on the golf course playing with their male work colleagues.","I've always said, the harder the golf course, the better I play.","When I leave the country, I'm very, very cautious about what I eat and drink.

I was very blessed in that sense.","I fear the future.","My main goal is to be the No. 1 American and the No. 1 player in the world. If an American is on top of the leader board every week, it will bring more people into the game of golf.","I've always wanted to win in my hometown.","I just have to keep working hard.","Practice, work out, proper nutrition, lots of work on my short game. In golf, that's really where the strokes come off the scorecard.","I like to address all parts of my game, but I'm really concentrating a lot of time with my coach, David Whelan, on my short game and on the greens.","I really enjoy what little time I have at home. The golf course and practice facilities are perfect and so close to home!","I learned that round four of a major is really not too much different than rounds one through three. I didn't keep to my game plan in the '08 U.S. Women's Open for the final round. That won't happen again!","I don't really have a 'favorite' person to play with. I like to play with the player that is playing the best, but it doesn't always work out that way.","I take being a role model very seriously.","There are so many lessons in life that can be learned through golf. I am not afraid to say that I am still learning some of them and probably will continue for some time.","I'm getting more and more comfortable out on the golf course with the changes I've been making. It's really just a confidence thing in that I love being in contention.","I just like being able to spend time with my family.","I want to win too bad.","Nobody ever wants to have change, that's for sure.

I want to do all of that.","I'm not normally content with what I do unless I win.","My expectations are incredibly high.","I put the most pressure on myself.","I've always - I grew up on the old-style traditional type of golf course, tree lined and all small greens, big undulations. And Oakmont just fit my eye.","I like it when, you know, 3-under wins, you know, 20-under par, it just brings so many other people into contention."],"Paula Danziger":["I want to keep meeting new people, enlarging my circle of friends.

And because it was just one book, and the father had moved away, I didn't realize I was going to have to deal more with shared custody, divorce and all those issues.","None of my characters seem to have had sex yet - I haven't written about that. And I wouldn't want to deal with what's happening in Oregon - the school shootings.","At age 12, I was put on tranquilizers when I should have gotten help. There was nothing major and awful, I just didn't feel my family was supportive and emotionally generous.","My father was a very unhappy person, very sarcastic, and my mother was very nervous and worried about what people thought. They weren't monsters, but it wasn't a good childhood.","I think my books talk about kids learning to like and respect themselves and each other. You can't write a message book; you just tell the best story you know how to tell.","The books are funny and sad, and that's what people respond to.","I'm very lucky. I'm very fortunate that my books have never gone out of print - none of them.","I try to be careful because technology changes so much over the years. But some things don't change. Kids and parents have disagreements, kids try to manipulate, parents try to sit down with rules and regs. That part never changes.","When my father would yell at me, I told myself someday I'd use it in a book.","I made the choice long ago to write about real life. And life is both serious and funny.","I tried to write with someone else once before, but it was not successful.","I deal with unhappy marriages a lot. I've never been married, I'm single.","I wish I had had my books when I was a kid, I do.","Normally, I name my characters after famous comedians.","Sometimes it's easier to show than it is to tell.","In my next life, I want to be tall and thin, parallel park and make good coffee. But for now, I have lots of stuff to work out in my life, but I'll have that until the day I die. I want to write more books."],"Paula Deen":["I don't care what the haters and naysayers say. If they make jokes about me, I'll laugh because they'll probably be funny.","I don't want to spend my life not having good food going into my pie hole. That hole was made for pies.","I'm so glad I'm not a dentist. How many times does someone say, 'Oh, Doc, it felt so good when you were drilling my teeth'? Never. But when you give someone a wonderful cookie, you put a little of yourself in, and you see someone's face light up - that's immediate approval.","There was one thing my daddy wouldn't tolerate in any shape, form or fashion, and that was being unkind or rude to somebody. That was just very important to my folks. And as it turns out, that was a legacy that he left me that money can't buy, is how to be able to treat people.","I will never use a substitute for butter. Margarine is one molecule away from eating plastic. If I'm going to eat that type of food, it's going to be the real deal.","You know, nobody can ever cook as good as your mama.","You don't want to make a steady diet of just lettuce. You don't want to make a steady diet of fried chicken.","Down South, even our vegetables have some pig hidden somewhere in it. A vegetable isn't a vegetable without a little ham hock.","I really didn't have an interest in being in the kitchen until after I was married, when I was 18. It didn't take me long to realize that Mama was not going to show up at my house every day and cook.","I know when you think about the South, you think about fried foods, but we eat a tremendous amount of vegetables. I have my own garden, so vegetables have always been a big part of my life. I love broccoli. I love fresh beets. It's not all about the fried chicken and the biscuits.","In order to have good fried chicken, you should wash and season the bird the morning you're preparing it for dinner. Don't wait and do it right before you start cooking. Throw it in the refrigerator, seasoned, that morning, and give it a chance to soak up all the salt and pepper and goodness.","I was determined to share my positive approach and not let diabetes stand in the way of enjoying my life.","The first thing I did was give up sweet tea because I drank so much. I'd start drinking at lunchtime and wouldn't set it down until I went to bed. When you calculate how much empty calories and how much sugar I was consuming, it was staggering. So I haven't had a glass of sweet tea in three years.","I have my new food line in the works - I think it's over 200 items. Hopefully I can make a difference; it's delicious food that's just so easy. I think it'll help people enjoy their lives... it's good!","Onions and bacon cooking up just makes your kitchen smell so good. In fact, one day I'm going to come up with a room deodorizer that smells like bacon and onions. It's a fabulous smell.","I am living proof that the American dream still exists. It is still alive and well. There is only one trick, you have to be willing to roll up your sleeves and work very, very hard.","I am proud to be a Southerner. I think Southern hospitality is very... I don't think it's just a term. I think it really exists. You can come to Savannah, and the people are so sweet and so nice.","Having an audience is almost like plugging me into an electrical outlet. People feed me so much of their energy. We have a great time. It's all about the fellowship.","You know, not everybody can afford to pay $58 for prime rib or $650 for a bottle of wine. My friends and I cook for regular families who worry about feeding their kids and paying the bills.","Southerners have never been afraid of seasoning. It's kind of the other way around; our seasoning is afraid of us.","I think if you've been invited to someone's house, you eat what they serve you. Even if you leave hungry, you be gracious enough to eat what they've prepared.","I am guilty of buying way too many gadgets - way too many! And though I try to keep things nice and orderly, sometimes I get distracted and stick saucepans where the stockpots should go.","When it's said and done, the one thing I want to leave on this earth is hope. I have felt hopelessness, and it's a terrible feeling. Hopelessness will destroy you. I want to bring hope to other people.","There's not one food that causes diabetes. What causes Type II diabetes is being overweight... I've just come to grips, over the past four or five months, with my diabetes.","Talking about money is garish. It's tacky.","I wake up every morning happy for where I am in life. It's not all about the cooking, but the fact that I can contribute by using my influence to help people all over the country. In the last two years, my partners and I have fed more than 10 million hungry people by bringing meat to food banks.","Growing up, I had a very busy social life. It wasn't until I was a sophomore in high school that I asked Mama if I could come into the kitchen and have her teach me how to cook something.","I found that when I went from Albany to Savannah, that I needed to put that white rice away, and I needed to turn that into Savannah red rice because they were big into that sausage, tomato-y, bell pepper-y rice mixture.","I figure it's almost like a balance. We're eating these wonderful collard greens and turnip greens which are so medicinally good for you and, OK, so what if it has a little ham hock in it?","Stone-ground grits are wonderful, but because they take so long to cook, I usually go with quick cooking grits - which I also love. But I never make the instant kind - some things a Southerner just won't do!","I know I can cook, but the place where I cook... it's a mess! I'm very disorganized.","I am so blessed. I've been way over-blessed. At 64 years old, I look forward to going to bed every night so I can wake up in the morning and see what blessing is going to come my way that day. Because you never, ever know what God's got in store for you.","I pay people very, very well - probably more than I have to. But that costs me less money in the long run because I'm not having to constantly train somebody. I pay them enough that they don't go seeking a higher scale at the next restaurant.","On my show I share all these yummy, fattening recipes, but I tell people, in moderation, in moderation. You can have that little piece of pie.","People see me on TV two and three times a day, and see me cooking all these wonderfully Southern, fattening dishes. That's only 30 days out of 365. And it's for entertainment.","Of course, I will continue to share my favorite Southern recipes, just like my mama, grandmother and family shared with me over the years. And now, I'll be adding a little bit of a lighter touch to some of these wonderful dishes.","I have a lot of secret uses for sour cream, which is the magic ingredient in my mac and cheese. It's an old-timey, Southern version, and the sour cream makes it that much creamier. Oh, it's so good!","It's amazing how good getting up and moving makes you feel.","I'm making little changes in my life to take care of myself, like putting in a mile or two on my treadmill every day.","We have made a commitment to feed 20-million people over the next two years. We are somewhere around 10 million. But I can promise you that we are not going to stop at 20 million. Because hunger, there is almost no cure for it. You can take care of the problem today, but it is a recurring problem.","In my house, the Rose Parade and the Rose Bowl Game have always been a grand tradition for ringing in the New Year. To serve as Grand Marshal is a dream come true and I look forward to sharing the celebration with all of the fans and viewers worldwide.","I love Hershey's chocolate. I feel the same about chocolate as I do about wine. Connoisseurs like dark chocolate and they like nasty wine that doesn't taste good to me. I don't get it!","You know, I understand that a lot of people, especially up north, put fruits and nuts in their stuffing, which is good, but for myself personally, I love an old-timey savory dressing.","I'll keep peace at all cost, even if I choke to death on my tongue.","The thought of eating rabbit and squirrels doesn't appeal to me. And that was on our table quite often as a kid. In your uppity restaurants, they serve a lot of rabbit. But I just can't help but think of Peter. And deer, I can't go there, because of Bambi.","I believe that... every one of God's creatures was created equal. I believe that everyone should be treated equal, that's the way I was raised and that's the way I live my life."],"Paula Fox":["My father brought me a box of books once when I was about three and a half or four. I remember the carton they were in and the covers with illustrations by Newell C. Wyeth.","In my early twenties, that's when I really began to write. Before that, I was too busy working, keeping myself going.","I taught writing classes at the University of Pennsylvania for a number of years and I realized that all you can do is encourage people and give them assignments and hope they will write them.","I don't know what makes a writer's voice. It's dozens of things. There are people who write who don't have it. They're tone-deaf, even though they're very fluent. It's an ability, like anything else, being a doctor or a veterinarian, or a musician.","My first job was working in a dress shop in Los Angeles in 1940, for $7 a week.","I like to cook; it is, for me, a happy combination of mindlessness and purpose.","I don't like to listen to music while I'm working.","I've always known a lot of very bad people, destructive, brutes of a certain kind. Then I've seen these lovely impulses and what not, and they've stayed with me and comforted me.","I have a painter's memory. I can remember things from my childhood which were so powerfully imprinted on me, the whole scene comes back.","There's a certain amount of tyranny in all of us to some extent, and in some people it's much more developed than in others. It's a different balance which makes us all different."],"Paula Garces":["I want to make sure that teenage girls know that if you decide to keep your child, you have to get an education. You have to have a plan A, B, and C. Make sure you have a good support system. If all those things are not in place, it's going to be very, very hard - very, very lonely.","I told everybody that I was going to be an actress in Hollywood one day. People looked at me like I was crazy.","I am a big, big geek at heart and a Sci-fi fan. And I love the Comic-Cons.","People tell me being a perfectionist is a fault, but I find that's what drives me.","I think the reason why I'm an actress is because I got hooked on the feeling of studying for an audition, going to the audition, and then getting that phone call.","It's definitely thrilling to know that you studied for something, and then you went in, and tried to do your best, and then somebody dug what you did.","I did a lot of commercials early on, and I remember the first commercial I ever got was for a product called Funyuns. I had to eat these chips for, like, 12 hours straight.","I'm South American, and growing up in New York, I had the total stereotypical way of thinking of what Texas was about. I'm like, Texas. Big. Cows. Cowboys. Cowboy hats and cowboy boots. And barbeque.","Obviously there aren't enough Latino roles out there - I wish there were more of them - but there's got to be more in the future. I'm sure there will be more in the future. The public is asking for it.","I think the reason why a lot of the Spanish films do so well, and are so well done, is because the public really respects it and wants it.","When I'm hired just to be an actress, I don't have to worry about anything else but showing up on set, making sure I know my lines and making sure I know what I'm bringing to the character. When I'm a creator and executive producer, I have to worry about the whole thing.","Growing up with Jennifer Lopez and Salma Hayek - people who were always trying to do something else - I wanted to follow in their footsteps. They gave people a different perspective of how women were supposed to look like and be.","The first time I got pregnant, I was a young girl - I was 17 years old. Although I knew right away that I wanted to keep my child, being a pregnant teen was an extremely scary experience for me. Luckily, my family and friends were very supportive and were there for me every step of the way.","There were the people that believed in me when I was walking around Spanish Harlem, saying that I was going to be a Hollywood actress. They were like, 'Yeah, you could do it!'","Let's be honest. The powers that be all of a sudden realize that there's a lot of money to be made from the Latino market. It all comes down to economics. That's what's happening. So what! We're in style. I mean, that's silly, but I'm taking full advantage of that.","Baby names are a big debate in my family. Like true Colombian and Puerto Rican families, everybody and their mother is putting their two cents in - everything from Jose to Francisco to Victorio to Rain has been suggested."],"Paula Hawkins":["The sort of enjoyment that we all get from that voyeuristic impulse of looking into other people's house as we pass them, and the idea that there might be something sinister or strange going on in the houses we pass every day or in our neighborhood, is a very compelling idea.","I know people like to read about serial killers and spies, but most of us will never encounter these things. Sadly, most of the threats we encounter are at home.","I was kind of broke . 'The Girl on the Train' was a last roll of the dice for me as a fiction writer.","One of the lovely things about writing when nobody knows who you are is there's no expectation.","You can do fascinating things with the tricks memory can play and tell. People can come to believe things which didn't happen at all if they're told them enough times.","I don't have a partner, so I take care of the mortgage by myself, and I was thinking, 'Oh God, I'm going to have to sell the house or find a new career.' I was not in a good place, but it was a real spur to get 'The Girl on the Train' right. I had to nail it and do it really well. It really concentrates the mind, that kind of thing.","I grew up in Zimbabwe in Southern Africa, and I moved to London when I was 17. And I started commuting and, actually, to go to college. And I used to really enjoy that part of my journey where the - it was actually a Tube train, but it was over ground, and it went right past the backs of people's houses, and I could actually see right in.","I'm not romantic, and I don't like Christmas.","I realized I do tragedy better than comedy.","The first Amy Silver book was commissioned, and they were not books that came completely from me. They weren't necessarily the sort of books I read, and although I enjoyed doing them very much, and they were great training, I never felt completely comfortable in that genre.","I adore Kate Atkinson, her literary as well as her crime output.","When I'm writing, I don't read much crime at all - you don't want to get distracted by other people's plots.","When I wrote 'The Girl on the Train,' nobody knew who I was, and that's quite a comfortable position to be writing in.","The journalism, I was a financial journalist - it's very good training as a writer. You have to write for deadlines; you have a certain economy of phrasing. As a training ground as a writer, it's fantastic. I also think it teaches you to be observant, to listen to people, and gives you an ear of dialogue from doing interviews.","Obviously, my name is known now, but I don't think people generally tend to recognize authors very much. People like J. K. Rowling maybe, Gillian Flynn might be recognized, but I reckon she could walk by me on the street, and I wouldn't know who she was.","Things like the movie 'Memento' are interesting to me because our memories of the things we've done and how we've behaved form our notion of who we are, what our character is. So if part of that were missing, what does that actually say about you? And what does it say about your sense of responsibility for things if you can't remember them?","Certainly, there is a tendency to lump women who write similar types of books together, and it's not just in crime, is it? Women's fiction is supposedly a whole genre of itself. There's no male equivalent.","When I write, I imagine places more than people.","'The Woman on the Train' just didn't sound as good. I'll take care next time not to have 'girl' in the title.","I spent a lot of time writing about tax and pensions and mortgages.","I'm not naturally an extrovert. I'm a writer - I sit in a room by myself making things up. That is where I'm happiest.","People think it's terribly sad to spend Christmas alone, but it's no sadder, really, than spending any other day alone, is it?","Women become invisible as they age; men become impotent.","I wrote four novels under the name Amy Silver. The first one was commissioned, and I was given basically the whole plot and the characters. They told me what to do, and I went straight away and did it. After that, I continued, and I was coming up with more my own ideas, although they did steer me.","Having something commissioned made it easier for me to share my work and see it out there and have people read it without feeling like there was a piece of my soul on the page.","I find writing the darker side, writing tragedy, a lot easier than writing happiness. Happiness is just less psychologically compelling, isn't it?","I am interested in the ordinary sort of threat. I know that people are interested in things like serial killers and what have you, but actually, those aren't the sort of crimes that really happen very much. The sort of crimes that happen tend to be more of a domestic nature and quite banal, but the psychology behind them is always fascinating.","I was commissioned to write some romantic fiction, and I really liked doing those, and they were very instructive in terms of building characters and plots. But it never felt right for me.","I have a fascination with the nasty things people do to each other and the way relationships go wrong, and how there can be this very dark underbelly to seemingly normal, mundane domestic life. They're the stories in the newspapers I always find interesting. That's not a very nice thing to admit to, is it?","My idea of fun is to sit looking at a blank wall in a cottage, making up stories in utter silence. The thought of going back to work in an office is horrendous.","I am single and without children. I'm actually one of those people who's just never had a great desire to have kids."],"Paula Jones":["I think I have made an impact in the workplace and I do believe that will prevail over any of the other things in the end.","I felt like all of the American people did not believe me because of the things that were said about me, and said that people would say that it was just for the money, and it wasn't about the money. It was about what he did to me. And I knew I was telling the truth.","I told the truth, and I did it on national TV in a lie-detector test."],"Paula Malcomson":["It's definitely hard to say good-bye to a character that you've played for a long time.","Cursing is heavily used in the Irish language. It's not a stretch for me, and I have no qualms about it. It doesn't fall far from the real me.","Listen, I'm from Belfast. We're not polite people. And it's language. We're direct.","There's no way to fake weight loss - you just kinda have to not eat.","A room full of hundreds, let alone thousands, of people is not my most fun thing in the world.","I'm pretty excited about the state of TV these days. There's great opportunity for really complicated relationships, in a way that I don't really see as much in movies anymore.","I try not to be too profane around children or old people. Other than that, that's how I speak.","If you're going to play a prostitute, you can't be too squeamish about that sort of thing. It's just part of the job, since the role requires it.","I just want to play strong characters, whatever that is in. For me, television is where it's at. You get to play a character for a long period of time, and you get to dig deep. It's a home to go to.","I'm not interested in a pretty world. It's boring to me. If you're lucky enough to get to play a character for a long time, it's life-changing.","I don't work with a lot of preparation. I think very well on my feet, and I'm very good when the pressure is on.","I'm not a Method actor - ask anybody.","I had a ringside seat to cancer. As have most people.","I have the same criteria for choosing roles as I have always had: fantastic writing and complicated characters.","Being a good actor is sort of understanding the complexity of the human psyche and also knowing that we are none of us perfect.","I love 'Happy Valley.' I love 'Transparent.' I love 'Fleabag.'","To me, movies is just scratching the surface for the work. There are people who are so, so great at that.","I like living with a character for a really long time and what can open up with that.","Actors bond really quickly.","I'd like to try comedy, at some point, but no one ever hires me for comedy, ever.","I've done network shows. A director will call me and say, 'Do you want to do this with me?' and I'll say, 'Sure,' but I couldn't do it forever because there's no real expression. That's not how people talk.","As actors, we're a little faster than other people with breaking down the walls.","I always go for just really, hopefully, great writing and great acting, being in the company of great actors.","I've been watching detective shows, like 'Wallander' and the Danish 'The Killing.' I'm like, 'That would be kind of fun to do.'","I like to work long-term on projects. It's fun to go in and out and get in there and do something and leave it behind, but to me, the real satisfaction is doing five years on a show, where you're really just up to your eyes in it. It's part of your life. That's what makes me the happiest.","I don't have keepsakes from shows, really. It's in the work. It's all there."],"Paula Marshall":["I think I was a pretty normal kid. I wasn't the prom queen, but I wasn't a freak, either.","I'm going to get T-shirts made that say 'Paula Marshall is Not a Show Killer.'","Really, life is so short. I can't believe I do this for a living. It's just unbelievable that Paula from Rockville, captain of the Peary pompom squad, can do this. It's the greatest thing ever.","'Snoops,' that was the worst.","I was the captain of the pompom squad but not the cheerleading squad. There's a difference. The Peary Poms were the best in the state.","I think it's rare to get on a show that lasts.","I've said no to shows that have been on the air for six years because they weren't what I wanted to do.","A lot of shows, like 'Cupid,' that I loved with all my heart, it shouldn't have been canceled.","I don't think I was ever responsible for anything being canceled.","I feel really fortunate that people keep hiring me. People think I have talent."],"Paula McLain":["I get suggestions all the time. People feel quite free at events or even on the street to tell me what they think I should be writing. What I've learned, though, is that this thing, this connection, has to be in place for me to be able to kind of launch into a world imaginatively.","I wrote a lot of poetry when I was a teenager - mostly desperate love poetry!","I took my first creative writing class when I was 24, then went onto to get a graduate degree in poetry. I've sort of never looked back from there.","It had never occurred to me to write a historical novel, but then I found Hadley in the pages of Hemingway's 'A Moveable Feast' and wanted to know more about her - who she was, how she and Ernest met and fell in love, what it was like for her to be married to such a demanding and stormy force of nature.","There are many days when I want to throw my computer out the window, when I tell myself I'd be better off selling shoes at the mall. But I always keep at it, because I have to. Writing is completely part of who I am. Even if I never published another book, I would keep at it - because it feeds my life and makes it richer."],"Paula Patton":["As a little girl I always dreamed of having a cosmetics contract, which was the cherry on top of 'making it' in my opinion.","Making African American films are hard in Hollywood. We need to rely on a support network and bring more cohesion to different filmmakers, actors, producers etc. It's a very difficult business. There aren't a lot of Africans Americans or people of color in high positions in Hollywood that we can green-light films.","First off let me say, I've wanted to be an actress since I was a little girl.","Becoming a mother is the best thing that's happened to me.","I think the age we're living in is starting to get scary.","I try not to have too many opinions; I just marvel at the world we live in.","A movie is painting, it's photography, it's literature - because you have to have the screenplay - it's music. Put a different soundtrack to a comedy and it's a tragedy. A movie combines all those forms and forces you to pay attention for two hours with a group of people.","If you're an actress and even one person knows your name, you're lucky.","If you have the capacity to love, you have the capacity to love anyone.","I love cola.","I'm black because that's the way the world sees me.","The older I get, the more I accept and appreciate myself.","Sometimes I do yoga, sometimes it's kickboxing, sometimes it's weight training, sometimes it's Pilates."],"Paula Pell":["I was a very earthly, matronly, plus-size little girl with a pure heart.","Young, handsome men never flirt with me. I get heat from old dudes that run the parking garages.","I grew up where the repercussion of you having an opinion was being 'cocky,' or people would be mad at you. And I have finally learnt that it is better for them to be mad at you and disagree than you be so mad at yourself all of the time for not speaking up.","Tina Fey is a very old friend of mine, and I adore her.","I think, as a woman, you have to really make sure that you're taking care of yourself and make sure that you're covered and you have enough material written for you.","I think it helps in any comedy room for a woman to have very strong, respected convictions, because then it opens the door up a little bit for other women to have that.","I was always a bit of a class clown.","I grew up with an extremely funny dad, and my mom is super funny.","At my confirmation, where you get the Holy Spirit, I came down the stairs at my party and had torn, like, 80 holes in my pantyhose and said I had the Holy Spirit, and just would do things like that all the time.","I'm a big hit at parties. Friends ask me to sing B-I-N-G-O all the time. I'm thinking, you know, of maybe putting out a Christmas album or something.","Everyone knows people like that: You're looking at their milky, glazed-over eyes, and you know they're not listening.","I have worked with many, many talented and dedicated people.","Some children challenge themselves to maybe run a marathon or something. I challenged myself to stay up for two days and make cinnamon toast and watch the Jerry Lewis Telethon and laugh and cry.","You're under the gun at all times because it's live TV. A lot of time, between dress and air, you're having to come with an entire ending to your sketch that gets an even better, bigger laugh - which is terrifying... People are filing into the audience, and you're writing a new joke for the end of it.","My sister is three years older and super foxy, and I always looked like a 50 year old woman.","'Hudson Valley Ballers' is just the joy of my life.","I'm a late bloomer, so I'm going to embrace it all.","I was really dramatic, really concerned with love or life.","I'm obsessed with 'Rocky.' We went 13 times to the theater.","I was born in Joliet, Illinois. It was totally Midwestern - small, little house, two great parents, and a sister and a beagle.","I went to a Catholic girls' school before we moved to Florida when I was 15.","My sister's journal was the romantic one with boys, and mine was talking about my rock tumbler. We were so different and so similar.","I'm a plus-size person, so when I tried to go into the Gap, I used to just walk out of there shaking my head because they have nothing that fits me.","Commercials used to have such a serious tone to them or a really corny tone.","My sister was three years older than me, and she was like the stone-cold '70s fox. I looked like a short Polish farm woman, and so our journals were wildly different.","I have written before, but I was primarily an actor and improvisational performer.","I was half Catskills comedian, half 1800s matron.","If you're hired to be a funny person, you have to trust your judgment but also be open because sometimes you think something's funny, and the next day you read it and go, 'Oh, my God.'","It's easy to trick yourself into thinking something's funnier than it is.","I've always loved the use of the word 'thick' when it comes to heavy because it's always a positive thing.","Starting probably with Janeane Garofalo and that era of stand-up ladies who were starting to be more brainy and strong and clever, guys started noticing those girls as sexy smart. I always called it smarxy.","I'd always be loaning my sister money, knowing full well I wasn't going to get it back. But she had the kids, and that paid me back.","It takes a special kind of family to bathe together in their 40s.","I think women are taking charge of the origins of a production, which is the most important part. Because you can't be a victim of whatever people ask you to do.","All the women I've grown up with at 'SNL' and other areas, and even the women that work with Judd Apatow, all those women are powerful, assertive women that have great material, and they just produce themselves.","I've got my foot in 'Saturday Night Live,' and my heart is there in a lot of ways, but I'm really pushing myself to do these new projects. It's scary as hell, but it's fun to have other things to keep my creative brain cooking.","It was really fun to start writing movies because you could actually take characters whose voice you enjoy writing in and have actual things happen to them for more than five minutes. It was really fun to thread it together.","My specialty at 'SNL' was doing triage. There was always a great need for someone to say, 'Make this funnier. Give me an ending for this. What's a better big laugh for this towards the end? What's a better physical joke in this?' And I just really, over time, honed that specific thing so well.","When I finally finished writing 'Sisters,' I started getting hired for lots of rewrites.","I've always felt, even with sketches, that if you don't care about these people, then it doesn't matter.","I was always a total ham, but my dad really taught me that.","I went to college at University of Tennessee.","Twitter is really - I got very addicted to it just because it's so simple, and it's like a video game for comedy writers to just do a one-liner about something."],"Paula Poundstone":["The problem with cats is that they get the exact same look on their face whether they see a moth or an axe-murderer.","Adults are always asking kids what they want to be when they grow up because they are looking for ideas.","When every high school graduate can spell the word, 'inauguration,' let's put lampshades on our heads and listen to his speeches until Obama's voice gives out.","My Mom said she learned how to swim when someone took her out in the lake and threw her off the boat. I said, 'Mom, they weren't trying to teach you how to swim.'","I don't have a bank account because I don't know my mother's maiden name.","When we save the rain forest, the polar bear, and Al Gore, we should party so hard that Canada calls the cops on us for noise.","The wages of sin are death, but by the time taxes are taken out, it's just sort of a tired feeling.","I love key lime pie, although it's never made the proper way.","I don't need a holiday or a feast to feel grateful for my children, the sun, the moon, the roof over my head, music, and laughter, but I like to take this time to take the path of thanks less traveled.","I was born in Alabama, but I only lived there for a month before I'd done everything there was to do.","When I sat down to write I just felt like a geek writing about myself. And then it dawned on me, just because of the way I am, I can't stop talking, and part of the problem is that anything that gets said reminds me of something that happened to me one time, and invariably I cut people off and talk about myself.","I can make things, but I don't cook them, exactly. Like salmon, I can stick that in a pan. Or the other day I made noodles, but they were hard. It never occurred to me to check them; I just stopped cooking them when I felt they were ready. Really, I'm too absentminded.","I have a horrible memory and I used to consider that a liability, but I've learned along the way that talking to people is really a beautiful thing.","How do you come back? It's one step at a time. I'm optimistic because I don't know what else to be.","I used to watch 'The Waltons' and sob because my family was nothing like that. We had a cruel sense of humor in my family.","I was the youngest in my family. When the other kids went to school, my mother would make them breakfast and then she would go back to bed for an hour, so I was sort of babysat by television.","I have a very silly sense of humor. I've never laughed harder in my entire life than seeing someone with toilet paper stuck on the bottom of their shoe.","I mean, I do love clever and witty, but I think that the 'Three Stooges' were geniuses. They'd have to be for their appeal to have lasted this long.","I only do two things in my life, and that's take care of my kids and work. Fortunately, these are my favorite things to do, so it works out.","President Obama could keep a big map with push pins on it to keep track of how many countries hate us, and when we get down to only half, let's have a ball. I'll blow up the balloons myself.","When we live up to our Constitution, let's form a Conga line around the Capitol and bungee jump off the dome.","I'm thankful for the three ounce Ziploc bag, so that I have somewhere to put my savings.","I'm thankful that my memory is good because my vision is going.","I'm thankful for Sarah Palin's vice presidential bid, which taught us that Alaska is not in a box off the coast of California.","I get the first flight out from anywhere I am because I have to come home to my kids.","I'm really more prolific than most stand-ups. My act changes. I do fold in new experiences, new observations, whatever you want to call it.","I did auditions at a club called the Comedy Connection. They wanted nothing to do with me. But one night they were doing a night of all women comics, and they invited me to do that.","I also like a great Caesar salad with anchovies, although I don't know why some places say 'with anchovies.' If you're making a proper Caesar salad, it's going to have anchovies.","There are really only so many foods and so many ways you can prepare them.","Once I was gone for a month and I was just miserable, so I flew back from Florida for two hours just to be home and see my cats.","I have jokes I've told before and will tell again, but my favorite part of the night is talking to the crowd.","I talk to a lot of librarians, and there's always a steady drumbeat of how libraries are places of community. But a lot of them have also recently - and just in the nick of time - refurbished, because during this economic downturn, people have a tendency to borrow instead of buy.","I was diagnosed a number of years ago with obsessive-compulsive disorder - which everyone has, to some degree - and I have this really annoying trait where in conversation, I always steer it back to something that happened to me.","I love talking to the audience, and I must be the luckiest performer in the world. I always land something or somebody that just takes off.","My act is sort of improvisational. I have a skeleton in my head, but no fat or skin on it."],"Paula Radcliffe":["You can be strong and true to yourself without being rude or loud.","In the marathon anything can happen.","Never set limits, go after your dreams, don't be afraid to push the boundaries. And laugh a lot - it's good for you!","It's important that athletes can compete on a level playing field. And youngsters coming into the sport can know that if they are working hard and training hard, they'll see a true reflection of where they stand and what they can achieve worldwide and not be swayed by people who are cheating.","I am not driven by any bitterness by what happened in Athens. I learnt a lot of lessons from it and probably came through it a stronger person in the end. There have been a lot of near misses, and that's taught me to keep persevering and that there is a chance it can come right.","I've no desire to do one of those 50-mile races like the Comrades or anything like that.","There's always going to be somebody who takes a dislike to you and you can't waste time worrying about it.","When you get close to race day, there's that anticipation and excitement - it's the same whatever level you're running at because the marathon is like a festival.","If I start planning then that's dangerous because then I have a target that I'm blinkered towards and I won't listen to the warning signs quite so much. I'd rather be in shape and then look around and say there's a race next week and jump into that than have it planned.","I would be happy with an Olympic bronze. What I don't have is an Olympic medal.","I am not going to let Athens affect the rest of my life.","I deliberately returned slowly to training after Raphael was born and everything, apart from being bitten by a dog whilst out training in Monaco at the beginning of the year, has gone pretty well.","I took a lot of bad things after Athens. I just learnt to deal with it. The problem was beforehand I had this feeling where I was trying to please everybody - I wanted everybody to like me.","A half marathon is a good way to have a bit of fun and race against those girls and learn a bit more about them. The world half marathon is a world championship at the end of the day and it's important. I've win it twice and it's a quality event.","For an athlete, the biggest pressure comes from within. You know what you want to do and what you're capable of.","I try not to worry about things that I can't control.","I have always loved running on the roads, ever since I used to take part in relays for my club when I was 12 and 13. I felt really at home on the surface.","Every time I go out and race it's a goal to go out and run faster than I've done before.","I can't imagine living and not running.","I have been doing 120 miles a week, when normally I would do about 140.","It's totally different from last year because I came in with good shape with no health worries so it was about going out there and running well and enjoying it.","From my training I can get a good idea of what I'm capable of.","In my Olympic history I don't think I have achieved my potential as an athlete. That's what I want when I look back at my career. I want to be able to say I gave it my best shot.","I just want to be in the best shape I can be. Not to stand on that start line and say: 'Oh my God, I have this injury and that injury.' I just want to be able to go out and race.","No one remembers who came fourth.","As an athlete, there are advantages being with a team and getting regular physio.","I set myself some specific goals, but the key one is just getting myself into as good a shape as possible for one day this year: the Olympic marathon.","You can wish as hard as you like but all that really matters is the shape you're in on the day of the race. I've always felt these really big races aren't necessarily won by whoever is the fastest. They're won by the athlete who is the smartest and in the best shape on the day.","To represent your country at a home Olympics is something special and I'm over the moon to be selected for Team GB. I was pleased to get the qualifying time in Berlin earlier this year and my sole focus is getting in the right shape for London.","You can't magic yourself back 10 years.","I prefer just a women's race. It's a totally different game mentally.","At big championships it's not the fastest person, it's the person who gets it right on the day.","The biggest danger is trying to put too much pressure on yourself, trying to get in too good shape.","An Olympic medal won't define my whole life, although it might look like it to onlookers. When I look back, I should have been able to get an Olympic medal.","I have always run as hard as I can. You are not going to run any harder with or without men. You are running on your own two feet.","I don't feel guilty in having pleasure!","I cry all the time.","I'm confident of what I have to achieve in the buildup to London 2012.","I have not had the chance to go out there and do myself justice in an Olympic marathon yet. I have not been able to get to an Olympic marathon injury-free yet.","I apologise to people when I need to.","I actually got a nice surprise about being a mother because I expected it to be harder and to have to make more adaptations.","I've always been good at putting things behind me - I fall apart, do my crying bit and then put it away and move it.","I've been to three Olympics and I don't feel I've ever quite achieved my best at any of them.","If you look back at my marathons and ask whether I would swap one of them for my one balls-up, of course I would. But you can't choose. You have to make the best of it on the day.","You see, with me, when I'm nervous, I smile and laugh.","In the week before a race, I try to stay away from germ areas. I keep disinfectant wipes in my bag for when I have to use a supermarket trolley or something like that.","I can swim I'm not bad, but not great.","I've had a lot of success over the years racing in New York, but the main point is that I feel the marathon is a different event, a lot more my event.","Plenty of people who are 38 have run really well in the marathon.","Actually I don't choose to expose myself in public. I choose to compete; the other side just comes with the package.","Yeah, ideally, I'd probably wish to be more anonymous. But scrutiny and success go together. And I want to be successful.","I'm not meek at all.","I have achieved a lot and I'm grateful for that - I'm just a bit greedy because I want to add the Olympics. It's once every four years - everyone wants it and very few people get it.","I don't like going away from my children.","Running gives me a lot of pleasure. It's something I'll always do, as long as I can.","I never plan to run at a certain pace. All my career my motto has been 'no limits.' I don't try to run with a set time in mind, sticking to set splits, because what happens if you're ahead of your splits - are you going to slow down?","I prefer to be in tune with my surroundings and to be aware of things. I like listening to my foot strike and my breathing. It can be quite soothing.","People are lying when they say that their record being broken is good for the development of the event. I would like mine to remain as long as possible, please."],"Paula Yates":["Now I'm starting, relatively, to think straight again. I live one day at a time, one hour at a time. What makes it all worthwhile is my children.","When Michael died I was tipped over the edge. I was beyond grief.","I don't think that sleeping with one of the owners gives you the advantages people think it does.","My mother was always in those films where it's the end of the world and a meteor's about to hit London; there's only six people left, and one of them's in purple underwear. That was always my mother, running from this meteor in purple underwear and spraining her ankle.","You might think about putting some heavy-duty hooks into the ceiling joists and beams so that you can have a rope ladder, or a small swing inside your house.","I don't remember my parents together, ever: my father was much older, and really only interested in collecting magazines and bathroom suites; we were the only family in the area to have a bathroom suite on the lawn."],"Paula Zahn":["We're just delighted that management has come around to my way of thinking.","I'm a mother, I'm a journalist, I'm an American; I'm all of those things, and it really complicates your job when you have all these things come into play.","My challenge was even greater as a journalist, because this was happening in my own backyard."],"Paulette Goddard":["I lived in Hollywood long enough to learn to play tennis and become a star, but I never felt it was my home. I was never looking for a home, as a matter of fact.","I love doing TV. It's such a breakneck pace, you know. It's kiss and go with your leading man. You meet them in the morning and go right into a clinch. The filming is over before you know their last names.","I'm always slightly embarrassed to meet other actresses of my vintage. We have so little in common. They're all so dedicated. I find - so desperate.","I am not temperamental. I just know what I want and if I don't have it, I try to get it."],"Pauley Perrette":["I've always hated criminals and crime. Life is hard enough without someone walking into your life on purpose and making it worse.","I have a big passion about civil rights for everyone - whoever is being downtrodden at the moment, it doesn't matter: racial discrimination or sexual orientation or gender. Whatever it is, I'm there. I think I was a born civil rights activist. I can't stand the smashing of a community. It's not fair and it's not right.","I always tell myself that when you're playing a character, pretend they're on trial and you're giving the best witness of their life. You really need to think about every element of the character and represent them properly, as if they were a real person. You want to give 100 percent of what they're worth and what they deserve as people.","I love math. I have little secret number tattoos everywhere. I design them.","In the women's movement, women needed men to stand up and say, 'This isn't right.' In the civil rights of the '60s, it took people of all color to demand equal rights.","When I was little, I think that I wanted Superman to be my boyfriend.","I grew up in the Deep South, where sexism, racism, and homophobia were and still are alive and well. I have early, early memories of words and actions of this type being very painful.","My whole goal was to be able to work in television and film and maintain a normal life, never be in a tabloid.","I love working with new directors. There's so much drive and effort. It still comes down to the character for me, but if it's a character I really want to play, I would never not do the project because of a new director.","I was a bartender in New York and I overheard this girl saying she made $3000 doing a commercial. A kid at work told me, 'Hey, I know this director and he'd really like you!'. So I walked into this guy's office and was like 'I was thinking maybe I could make $3000' and he hired me for commercials, short films, like 15 jobs in a row.","I ended up in college by accident. Everything in my life, I ended up in by accident. I was down south in this high school doing whatever. It could just not contain me. I quit school and took off and traveled around. Nobody knew where I was I just couldn't handle it anymore. It was a big scandal, I was gone. I left.","Pauley Perrette: I was a criminal science fanatic and went to study it in college as well and I think that helped me on NCIS because I was comfortable with the language, I had studied criminal science in school for years.","In many ways, acting is really like a science to me to figure out the human behavior of any character that I'm playing.","I like having black hair. When I was really young, I wanted to be Asian - Asian hair is beautiful. I also wanted to look like the girl in George Michael's 'Father Figure' video.","I hated high school and got to college and realized they didn't care if I showed up because I'd already paid. So I decided, 'I'm going to turn this around.' And I did: I got straight A's and was named 'outstanding senior.'","Personally, I am a church-going Christian. I love my church, my congregation; it's my favorite place to be.","Love is a big word. I believe in Love. I believe that God is Love.","I'm super-obsessed with law enforcement. I'm what you'd call a 'cop fan.'","I believe that what is legislated bleeds down into everything. So if the legislation continues to uphold anything that doesn't support equal rights and civil rights, that bleeds down into Matthew Shepard being murdered.","I started out as a writer. Poetry and prose and also kind of satirical David Sedaris-esque stuff.","When I was in N.Y. bartending, I was in a billion music videos. I was in Madonna, George Michael, Salt-n-Pepa - it goes on and on.","My absolute favorite movie of all time is Pink Floyd's 'The Wall.' Nothing compares to it. I have seen it thousands of times and still watch it every few weeks.","The Internet is a strange, strange place that is full of lies. I would say mostly lies.","Each of us has the choice to attend the church we want to, or none at all. Separation of church and state allows for religions to have their own set of rules as to whom they will accept and who they won't, and the practices they support and the ones they don't. They will continue to be able to do so."],"Paulina Porizkova":["I will continue to be intelligent, I vowed, no matter how beautiful I become.","Now, I don't actually know the exact cut-off age where beautiful ceases and 'must have-once-been-beautiful' begins. It's true it's not forty-five. I can still get attention when I try really hard, even if it's greatly reduced.","My boyfriend thinks I lost my true calling to be a librarian.","When I model I pretty much go blank. You can't think too much or it doesn't work.","I have now spent over a year trying to figure where in the workplace I belong.","I have worked every day since the age of fifteen, supporting not only myself, but also helping a sizable family when needed.","Fame is an interesting phenomenon.","The real bummer of fame is that at some point you're bound to get demoted.","My first recognition of age setting in was exactly on my 36th birthday. I have no idea why, on this day of all days, I looked in the mirror and realized my face no longer looked young.","Beauty, unlike the rest of the gifts handed out at birth, does not require dedication, patience and hard work to pay off. But it's also the only gift that does not keep on giving.","I was fired by 'America's Next Top Model' on my birthday."],"Paulina Rubio":["Everyone has a Latino inside them.","I like to be glamorous so I love the clothing and the big entrances. It needs to be spectacular!","My music, my songs are 100 percent inspired by girl power.","I started in a band called 'Timbiriche', we toured the world when I was 8; I have 23 albums.","I was born in Mexico, I am from Mexico City.","With 'Timbiriche', I toured Brazil and a lot of Latin America.","There are a lot of influences from different countries in my music. For example, I chose the guitar in my music, I think that it is a feminine instrument, so when I do not sing, the music expresses my voice."],"Pauline Collins":["I have played a few lay saints in my time.","I think goodness is very powerful, but often evil is made more attractive in films. It's a challenge to make goodness appealing.","I was brought up a Catholic, so I suppose I have to believe in the goodness of human beings. I think we're not so bad after all.","Theater is an engagement between the actor and the audience. Film is a different sort of medium. It's not immediate, but in some ways it's more involving.","I think you can lose yourself more easily in a film than in the theater.","We all press buttons in relationships, in our dealings with people, without thinking what it really means. We all knock along without questioning what kind of situation we're in. We may often be in a very good one, but we don't even appreciate the good situations. We're lazy. Or we're scared. Or we just don't notice.","Certainly, I, as an audience, am stricken with terror if I see only two people onstage. And one person, I think, is even harder for people to take.","We all think we're liberated when we have more of everything, don't we? That's what the media tell us.","When I started performing, I decided that if in five years I couldn't earn as much money acting as I could as a teacher, it would be unrealistic for me to continue on the stage."],"Pauline Ferrand-Prevot":["In cycling, you just race. When you get to the finish, you see the result.","When you win a world title, you are motivated to work.","People wanted to put me in one category, I think because it was easier for them.","Now, with all my world titles, I am very happy because I can say to all those people that what I chose to do was good for me.","In ice dancing, you cannot decide your result. You just have to do your best, and you can't decide if you win or not.","You need to respect the rules; they are the same for everybody.","The Rio Games, it will be a big goal."],"Pauline Frederick":["When a man gets up to speak, people listen then look. When a woman gets up, people kook; then, if they like what they see, they listen.","I think the kind of career I've had, something would have had to be sacrificed.","Because when I have been busy at the United Nations during crises, it has meant working day and night."],"Pauline Gedge":["I don't read much when I'm working. When I'm finished work, I don't want a thing to do with words.","I'm not ashamed to say I love television. I put the TV on, and my brain switches off, and I just sit there for a few hours."],"Pauline Hanson":["To survive in peace and harmony, united and strong, we must have one people, one nation, one flag.","Tolerance has to be shown by those who come to this country for a new way of life. If you are not prepared to become Australian and give this country your undivided loyalty, obey our laws, respect our culture and way of life, then I suggest you go back where you came from.","It is refreshing to be able to express my views without having to toe a party line. It has got me into trouble on the odd occasion, but I am not going to stop saying what I think.","Islam cannot have a significant presence in Australia if we are to live in an open, secular, and cohesive society. We have seen the destruction it is causing around the world.","I may be only a fish and chip shop lady, but some of these economists need to get their heads out of the textbooks and get a job in the real world. I would not even let one of them handle my grocery shopping.","Australia has embraced migrants from all different races, making us one of the most multiracial nations on earth. Most have assimilated and are proud to call themselves Australians, accepting our culture, beliefs and laws. I welcome them from the bottom of my heart. As they integrate and assimilate, the disruption caused by diversity diminishes.","There is no sign saying 'good Muslim' or 'bad Muslim.' How many lives will be lost or destroyed trying to determine who is good or who is bad?","Islam does not believe in democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, or freedom of assembly. It does not separate religion and politics. It is partly a religion, but it is much more than that. It has a political agenda that goes far outside the realm of religion.","In this financial year we will be spending at least $1.5 billion on foreign aid and we cannot be sure that this money will be properly spent, as corruption and mismanagement in many of the recipient countries are legend.","This nation is being divided into black and white, and the present system encourages this.","I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians.","I do not believe that the colour of one's skin determines whether you are disadvantaged.","The World Health Organisation has a lot of its medical experts sitting in Geneva while hospitals in Africa have no drugs and desperate patients are forced to seek medication on the black market.","I will fight hard to keep my seat in this place, but that will depend on the people who sent me here.","We are regarded as a Third World country with First World living conditions.","I come here not as a polished politician but as a woman who has had her fair share of life's knocks.","We must look after our own before lining the pockets of overseas countries and investors.","My view on issues is based on common sense, and my experience as a mother of four children, as a sole parent, and as a businesswoman running a fish and chip shop.","A social problem is one that concerns the way in which people live together in one society. A racial problem is a problem which confronts two different races who live in two separate societies, even if those societies are side by side.","The majority of Aboriginals do not want handouts because they realise that welfare is killing them.","If politicians continue to promote separatism in Australia, they should not continue to hold their seats in this parliament. They are not truly representing all Australians, and I call on the people to throw them out.","We have one of the highest interest rates in the world, and we owe more money per capita than any other country. All we need is a nail hole in the bottom of the boat and we're sunk.","Governments must give to all those who have hit life's hurdles the chance to rebuild and have a future.","We have lost all our big Australian industries and icons, including Qantas when it sold 25 % of its shares and a controlling interest to British Airways.","The government must do all it can to help reduce interest rates for business."],"Pauline Kael":["Where there is a will, there is a way. If there is a chance in a million that you can do something, anything, to keep what you want from ending, do it. Pry the door open or, if need be, wedge your foot in that door and keep it open.","I see little of more importance to the future of our country and of civilization than full recognition of the place of the artist. If art is to nourish the roots of our culture, society must set the artist free to follow his vision wherever it takes him.","Trash has given us an appetite for art.","A mistake in judgment isn't fatal, but too much anxiety about judgment is.","In the arts, the critic is the only independent source of information. The rest is advertising.","Kevin Costner has feathers in his hair and feathers in his head. The Indians should have called him 'Plays with Camera.'","This movie is a toupee made up to look like honest baldness.","One of the surest signs of the Philistine is his reverence for the superior tastes of those who put him down.","Citizen Kane is perhaps the one American talking picture that seems as fresh now as the day it opened. It may seem even fresher.","A book might be written on the injustice of the just.","The critic is the only independent source of information. The rest is advertising.","Movies are so rarely great art that if we cannot appreciate great trash we have very little reason to be interested in them.","The first prerogative of an artist in any medium is to make a fool of himself.","It seems likely that many of the young who don't wait for others to call them artists, but simply announce that they are, don't have the patience to make art."],"Pauline Marois":["The biggest risk to Quebec isn't sovereignty. It is staying in Canada.","I feel like saying we need to all calm down a little. Let's take the time to breathe. I have no intention of allowing myself be distracted.","Never, never, will I accept, on issues of integrity, comparisons with the Liberal party.","Sovereignty is as necessary as ever.","Sovereignty was not an issue in this campaign. The sovereignty numbers that were there before the campaign are still there. Sovereignty is as alive as it was. But there is work to do to convince Quebecers.","My victory is your victory. My victory is the victory of a unified party, a party that wants to propose to the Quebec people a country that is free and a country that is independent.","We want a country. and we will get it, our country.","For me, everything is still possible and I am as determined as ever. I believe first that the project of a people does not die. It is the project of freedom for a people, it is a project of sovereignty. And since the nation exists, it has the right to its own state. I will work to advance it in that direction.","We don't know what proportion of public funds is regularly lost to collusion and corruption. Is it 25 per cent? 30 per cent? We do know that a portion of these public funds are feeding organized crime.","We have a beautiful program which is audacious and I really want us all to roll up our sleeves and to work at making it a success.","I can assure you the hemorrhaging has stopped. I asked remaining caucus members if they adhered to the party program, if they would stay in the PQ and that they would be by my side. They all said yes.","One of the ways to make sure policies are more transparent and to help restore people's confidence in politicians... is to ensure renewal at the highest level of office.","The anglophones are Quebecers, as are the French, as are the new Quebecers.","You know, I would like to ask to the other parts of Canada to respect the minority of the French Canadians.","You know, now there is always half of the new Quebecers who are going to the English CEGEP. After that, often they are going to work in English. So for us, that is so important. We are a real minority in North America. Two per cent of the population are French-speaking. We have to protect this reality.","There is a false assumption about the Parti Quebecois that we don't know anything about the economy... Well that's a myth.","I want to tell Quebecers that are listening: if you want to get back to the goal of creating a country, only a majority government can do it, a sovereigntist government of the Parti Quebecois.","I'm not a snob.","You know, kicking people's butts with round-edged boots is good, but with pointy shoes, it's even better.","No one can buy me. It allows me to devote myself completely to what I do. Knowing that I'm comfortable removes a big burden off my shoulders.","I joined the PQ in the 1970s because of the issue of sovereignty. And that's why I wake up in the morning. A woman who gives birth to a country, that would be interesting.","If Quebeckers want Jean Charest, well, they can choose him. It's never a winning formula to divide Quebeckers.","We do not want the Quebec nation to disappear.","Cynicism lost and hope won. For the first time, the government of Quebec will be led by a woman.","I hope that one day the people of Quebec will one day be a part of the concert of nations. This is an internal debate. This will happen when Quebecers are ready."],"Pauline Neville-Jones":["The suicide bombers who struck London on 7 July 2005 killed 52 innocent people and wounded hundreds more. All of them must live with their memories. And the rest of us will always remember where we were when we heard that London had been hit by the worst terrorist attack in its history.","One of the marked characteristics of the U.K. security industry as compared with defence is the lack of company scale. This can put our firms at a competitive disadvantage when it comes to big contracts.","I am sorry to be leaving the BBC. I have enjoyed a fascinating seven years at the corporation and am particularly proud to have played a small part in the development of the BBC's Global News services, BBC World Service and BBC World.","I was certainly never conscious of 'playing the woman.' I would not have approved of that. It is not a winning tactic. I operated in the world as I found it, and it was a man's world.","Women tend to break the network of friends they make, but it is a habit that men have learned. It is an approach to life that involves planning almost without thinking about it. And men sustain this. I came from a northern grammar school. I had a good education, but I didn't have a good network.","When I first left university, I thought about going into the private sector. But I discovered when I went to interview that I could only have a career in the back office, or doing HR. The attitude was, 'My dear lady, you cannot possibly think about going on the board.'","It is really important for women to look up and see other women being successful. When I was in that position, all I wanted to do was blend in and be one of the guys.","Well, one thing's very clear, that terrorism isn't just a threat which is external to Western countries. It's not simply a foreign menace that comes from overseas to strike our cities. It can and it does, as we now know, come from within our own countries and from inside our own populations.","Those who say that the West and Islam are eternally irreconcilable have more in common with the Islam extremists than they might like to think, for it's the very same argument of course advanced by Al-Qaida. And they do have it wrong. We need to work with mainstream Islam.","Our work in Britain suggests that radicalization is driven by an ideology which claims that Muslims around the world are being oppressed and - and this is the key bit of the argument - which then legitimizes violence in their supposed defense.","The Internet plays an ever more significant role in the sedulous promotion of terrorism. We know that in the U.K., groups gather to view the preaching of violent men located many thousands of miles away and that this does have a powerful effect on young minds.","We owe it to the victims of the suicide bombers who struck London on 7 July 2005 to find out how the attacks happened and to learn the lessons that will spare lives in the future.","The British security industry has the capacity to be a world leader and it should be our shared objective to achieve this.","To a considerable extent we are faced by a technology arms race with terrorists. The communications revolution has made it easier for terrorist groups to reach out to vulnerable individuals with their violent extremist ideology and propaganda. It has also facilitated fundraising, recruitment and training.","As the BBC approaches the final phase of decisions about its future, it will be important for those involved to be established in post and ready to take responsibility for implementation of the outcome.","The BBC's television, radio and online services remain an important part of British culture and the fact the BBC continues to thrive amongst audiences at home and abroad is testament to a professional and dedicated management team who are committed to providing a quality public service."],"Pauline Phillips":["A church is a hospital for sinners, not a museum for saints.","Loneliness is the ultimate poverty.","People who fight fire with fire usually end up with ashes.","There are two kinds of people in the world. Those who walk into a room and say, 'There you are' and those who say, 'Here I am'","If we could sell our experiences for what they cost us, we'd all be millionaires.","If you want children to keep their feet on the ground, put some responsibility on their shoulders.","The less you talk, the more you're listened to.","If you want a place in the sun, you've got to put up with a few blisters.","True, a little learning is a dangerous thing, but it still beats total ignorance.","Never give a golfer an ultimatum unless you're prepared to lose.","It is true that I was born in Iowa, but I can't speak for my twin sister.","It is a sad commentary of our times when our young must seek advice and counsel from 'Dear Abby' instead of going to Mom and Dad.","Religion, like water, may be free, but when they pipe it to you, you've got to help pay for piping. And the Piper!"],"Pauline Trigere":["Fashion is what people tell you to wear. Style is what comes from your own inner thing.","The clothes have to perform for me.","I was really a little housewife with two small children, and I had a husband who really didn't want his wife to work. He didn't like the competition. That's why I'm not married to him anymore.","There was no drive because I wanted to become a great designer... I had two small children and a mother, and we all had to eat. That's the drive I had.","I always tried to design something new and of the moment. The idea was not to make something that would last, but to make something a woman could really wear when she needed it, like a good friend.","I never made crazy clothes.","I'm past 75, I still walk, and I don't dye my hair blond, and I don't touch it up."],"Paullina Simons":["With my writing, because I live it, I have to be consumed by it, and that means you have to forget your other life, which is constantly pulling you from your work.","When I was growing up, 'Anna Karenina' was one of my favourite books.","I wish I could spend six years writing one novel.","There is a very definite Russian heart in me; that never dies. I think you're born and you live your life with it and you die with it. I'm very much an American - my books tend to be about American things, but inside there's that sort of tortured, long-suffering, aching, constantly analysing Russian soul underneath the happy American exterior.","You have to keep your audience in your mind; if you're writing stuff that you know nobody's going to care about then you should rethink what you're doing!","I tend to be a great optimist when it comes to the United States and the American way of life, I think precisely because I wasn't born into it.","I have a certain sensibility that I bring to my writing that comes from knowing two things: what I as a reader like to read, and what as a writer I am capable of. I know my own limits. I know there are things I cannot do."],"Paulo Coelho":["I have seen many storms in my life. Most storms have caught me by surprise, so I had to learn very quickly to look further and understand that I am not capable of controlling the weather, to exercise the art of patience and to respect the fury of nature.","Remember your dreams and fight for them. You must know what you want from life. There is just one thing that makes your dream become impossible: the fear of failure.","Life was always a matter of waiting for the right moment to act.","Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience.","Waiting is painful. Forgetting is painful. But not knowing which to do is the worse kind of suffering.","When you are enthusiastic about what you do, you feel this positive energy. It's very simple.","I can control my destiny, but not my fate. Destiny means there are opportunities to turn right or left, but fate is a one-way street. I believe we all have the choice as to whether we fulfil our destiny, but our fate is sealed.","No one can lie, no one can hide anything, when he looks directly into someone's eyes.","When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.","Culture makes people understand each other better. And if they understand each other better in their soul, it is easier to overcome the economic and political barriers. But first they have to understand that their neighbour is, in the end, just like them, with the same problems, the same questions.","You have to take risks. We will only understand the miracle of life fully when we allow the unexpected to happen.","You drown not by falling into a river, but by staying submerged in it.","The good old days, when each idea had an owner, are gone forever.","Love is a trap. When it appears, we see only its light, not its shadows.","The more in harmony with yourself you are, the more joyful you are and the more faithful you are. Faith is not to disconnect you from reality - it connects you to reality.","The more violent the storm, the quicker it passes.","I cry very easily. It can be a movie, a phone conversation, a sunset - tears are words waiting to be written.","Elegance is usually confused with superficiality, fashion, lack of depth. This is a serious mistake: human beings need to have elegance in their actions and in their posture because this word is synonymous with good taste, amiability, equilibrium and harmony.","Elegance is achieved when all that is superfluous has been discarded and the human being discovers simplicity and concentration: the simpler and more sober the posture, the more beautiful it will be.","When I'm dancing, I'm not thinking about anything. I am here. I am totally there. You know? And the feeling is a sensation of being away from myself. My soul dances with the angels, and my body dances with my wife.","One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving.","The two worst strategic mistakes to make are acting prematurely and letting an opportunity slip; to avoid this, the warrior treats each situation as if it were unique and never resorts to formulae, recipes or other people's opinions.","Everybody has a creative potential and from the moment you can express this creative potential, you can start changing the world.","No, I never saw an angel, but it is irrelevant whether I saw one or not. I feel their presence around me.","Every blessing ignored becomes a curse.","We have lost contact with reality, the simplicity of life.","Writing means sharing. It's part of the human condition to want to share things - thoughts, ideas, opinions.","What I can say is that all my characters are searching for their souls, because they are my mirrors. I'm someone who is constantly trying to understand my place in the world, and literature is the best way that I found in order to see myself.","You can become blind by seeing each day as a similar one. Each day is a different one, each day brings a miracle of its own. It's just a matter of paying attention to this miracle.","Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dream.","Everybody is a political person, whether you say something or you are silent. A political attitude is not whether you go to parliament; it's how you deal with your life, with your surroundings.","Love can consign us to hell or to paradise, but it always takes us somewhere.","Everything that happens once can never happen again. But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time.","However happy people say they are, nobody is satisfied: we always have to be with the prettiest woman, buy a bigger house, change cars, desire what we do not have.","Every day I try to be in communication with the universe in an unconscious way.","Everything is possible, from angels to demons to economists and politicians.","I've done everything I wanted to do, even if I have had to pay a very high price - which has been the case most of the time.","I always was a rich person because money's not related to happiness.","The gigantic tension before the shooting of an arrow, and the total relaxation seconds later, is my way of connecting to the universe.","My literature is much more the result of a paradox than that of an implacable logic, typical of police novels. The paradox is the tension that exists in my soul.","You're always learning. The problem is, sometimes you stop and think you understand the world. This is not correct. The world is always moving. You never reach the point you can stop making an effort.","I write from my soul. This is the reason that critics don't hurt me, because it is me. If it was not me, if I was pretending to be someone else, then this could unbalance my world, but I know who I am.","When a person really desires something, all the universe conspires to help that person to realize his dream.","All women have a perception much more developed than men. So all women somehow, being repressed for so many millennia, they ended up by developing this sixth sense and contemplation and love. And this is something that we have a hard time to accept as part of our society.","The wise are wise only because they love. The fool are fools only because they think they can understand love.","What interests me in life is curiosity, challenges, the good fight with its victories and defeats.","I have been practicing archery for a long time; a bow and arrow helps me to unwind.","I lived in a dictatorship in Brazil, and I was arrested three times. I felt in my flesh what it is to live under such a regime and experience deprivation of freedom.","Let us be absolutely clear about one thing: we must not confuse humility with false modesty or servility.","It's not difficult for me to put my feelings into written form. I try to be concise and to go direct to the subject. This is what people like about my work, and what the critics hate.","I tweet in the morning and the evening. To write 12 hours a day, there is a moment when you're really tired. It's my relaxing time.","Sometimes I catch myself stooping, and whenever I am like that, I am sure something is not quite right.","I'd have stopped writing years ago if it were for the money.","There is an afterlife. I am convinced of this.","We have to stop and be humble enough to understand that there is something called mystery.","People are very reluctant to talk about their private lives but then you go to the internet and they're much more open.","Jesus lived a life that was full of joy and contradictions and fights, you know? If they were to paint a picture of Jesus without contradictions, the gospels would be fake, but the contradictions are a sign of authenticity.","MySpace is an addiction.","I talk to my readers on social networking sites, but I never tell them what the book is about. Writing is lonely, so from time to time I talk to them on the Internet. It's like chatting at a bar without leaving your office. I talk with them about a lot of things other than my books.","Things do not always happen the way I would like them to happen, and I had better get used to that.","I believe enlightenment or revelation comes in daily life. I look for joy, the peace of action. You need action. I'd have stopped writing years ago if it were for the money.","The major religions, Christianity, Judaism, Islam, they deny somehow that God has a feminine face. However, if you go to the holy texts, you see there is this feminine presence.","I think you can have 10,000 explanations for failure, but no good explanation for success.","Writing is a solitary experience. I'm extremely superstitious. If I talk about the book or name the title out loud before finishing, I feel the energy I need to write will be drained. It's so intimate, I can't even share it with my wife.","About the idea of a clash between cultures, between civilisations, I don't believe in it. It's something some political leaders tried to use, and that the media tried and are still trying to sell us, in order to simplify the world and their work.","Beauty is the greatest seducer of man.","It took me 40 years to write my first book. When I was a child, I was encouraged to go to school. I was not encouraged to follow the career of a writer because my parents thought that I was going to starve to death.","I'm not a person that socializes very well.","MySpace is my wife... Facebook is my mistress.","With all due respect, the Mona Lisa is overrated.","You should treat a muse like a fairy.","We want to answer this classical question, who am I? So I think that most of our works are for art, or whatever we do, including science or religion, tried to answer that question.","I am 100 per cent Virgo, stubborn, over-organised, slightly abstracted from the rest of the world.","I'm first and foremost a writer. I followed my personal legend, my childhood dream of becoming a writer, but I can't say why I'm one.","This may sound a little bit idealistic, but when I go to my blog, my Facebook page, my Twitter account, I talk to different people from all over the world, and you see how it's easy to establish a dialogue.","Twitter is my bar. I sit at the counter and listen to the conversations, starting others, feeling the atmosphere.","In the United States, I am a great success, but I am not a celebrity.","The only thing that relaxes me is archery. That's why I have to have apartments with gardens.","I was not encouraged to follow the career of a writer because my parents thought that I was going to starve to death. They thought nobody can make a living from being a writer in Brazil. They were not wrong.","Happiness is just another of the tricks that our genetic system plays on us to carry out its only role, which is the survival of the species.","Most of my young years were spent under the boots of the military.","I don't try to control my days.","I am a Catholic because I choose to be a Catholic. And then I go to the Mass because I choose. It is out of my free will.","My connection with Brazil is so abstract. My blood and my way of thinking is Brazilian, but that's it. I don't tend to go back to the past, and although I have an apartment there, I rarely visit. When I move, I really move.","I can't consciously explain how people feel after reading my books. All is too personal.","I'm not saying that love always takes you to heaven. Your life can become a nightmare. But that said, it is worth taking the risk.","Of course, to have money is just great because you can do what you think is important to you. I always was a rich person because money's not related to happiness.","Everything for me is sacred, beginning with earth, but also going to things made by man.","I was arrested three times and tortured once.","I walk every day, and I look at the mountains and the fields and the small city, and I say: 'Oh my God, what a blessing.' Then you realise it's important to put it in a context beyond this woman, this man, this city, this country, this universe.","I don't set out to write about spirituality; I am free to do something different every time.","I am not happy, and the quest for happiness as a principal objective is not part of my world. Of course, ever since I can remember, I have done what I felt like doing.","When you write an article about anything, trolls use the comments to attack. They feel frustrated - but haters are losers. It's not good to feed this aspect. It's more intelligent to be constructive.","I had this dream to become a writer since I was a teenager.","Physical elegance, which is what I am talking about here, comes from the body. This is no superficial matter, but rather the way that man found to honour the way he places his two feet on the ground.","If you start by promising what you don't even have yet, you'll lose your desire to work towards getting it.","Music for me, it demands full concentration.","It's very difficult to read a book on your computer.","Publishing is in a kind of Jurassic age.","Publishers see free downloads as threatening the sales of the book.","I am a Catholic.","I never say I am a guru.","I'm modern because I make the difficult seem easy, and so I can communicate with the whole world.","Writers are lampposts and critics are dogs. Ask lampposts what they think about dogs. Does the dog hurt the lamppost?","Today, writers want to impress other writers.","I hate to be smart.","I don't go to parties in general.","My readers - and I get 400 emails for a day, my readers normally they say, well, you understand me, and I answer, you do understand me also. We are in the same level.","Once I found this possibility to use Twitter and Facebook and my blog to connect to my readers, I'm going to use it, to connect to them and to share thoughts that I cannot use in the book.","When I write a book, I write a book for myself; the reaction is up to the reader. It's not my business whether people like or dislike it.","I am not a self-help writer. I am a self-problem writer. When people read my books, I provoke some things. I cannot justify my work. I do my work; it is up to them to classify it, to judge.","I wanted to write when I was young, but people said it was impossible. Then my parents locked me in a mental institution - they said I was crazy and would never make a living from writing.","Of course, to have money is just great because you can do what you think is important to you.","In writing, I apply my feminine side and respect the mystery involved in creation.","I love almost everything about my work except conferences. I am too shy in front of an audience. But I love signings and having eye contact with a reader who already knows my soul.","I have spent every New Year's Eve since 1992 in Lourdes. I spend the hour of my birth every year in the grotto. It's a place with meaning for me.","I am a Catholic, not so committed to the church, but to the idea of the Virgin, the female face of God."],"Paulo Costanzo":["I'm a musical theater aficionado, a.k.a. loser.","Yes, I'm half Italian. So my grandfather speaks heavy Italian... and I couldn't understand a word he said.","In high school, my first thing ever was I played Tony in 'West Side Story' when I was about 17. I was a really shy kid, and I just, like, forced myself to learn how to sing this one month because I loved 'West Side Story' so much, and I somehow managed to get the role.","What I would love is a crossover between 'Royal Pains' and 'Burn Notice,' that we could be involved in some sort of gun play intrigue. I would really love that because we have no guns. We have nowhere near enough explosions and guns on the set.","I grew up as a fairly poor kid in, you know, Toronto, Canada. I don't think I owned any new clothes until I was, like, 15 or something. They were all second-hand and forged from paper.","I'm an east coaster, you know, I'm brought up in Toronto where it's very much, like, kind of a miniature New York in that there's a subway and you're surrounded by people a lot and, you know, you bump into people and you have interactions and you communicate and la la la.","I've always wanted to play Jerry Seinfeld's son, actually, because he's the only person who anyone ever says I look like, in my entire - ever in my life.","My parents were hippies. They met at an ashram, where they were studying how to be enlightened.","No one ever comes up to me and says, 'Hey man, I loved your work in 'Road Trip.' They say, 'Are you that guy?' Like, they have no idea. 'Were you in 'American Pie 2?'","I started out more interested in drama, but comedy just came naturally to me, and it's become what I'm most known for, even though my sensibilities still lean towards the dramatic for the most part."],"Paulo Freire":["Education is freedom.","At a certain point in their existential experience, the oppressed feel an irresistible attraction toward the oppressor and his way of life. Sharing this way of life becomes an overpowering aspiration.","Critical and liberating dialogue, which presupposes action, must be carried on with the oppressed at whatever the stage of their struggle for liberation. The content of that dialogue can and should vary in accordance with historical conditions and the level at which the oppressed perceive reality.","Liberating education consists in acts of cognition, not transferrals of information.","The oppressed, having internalized the image of the oppressor and adopted his guidelines, are fearful of freedom.","Washing one's hands of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless means to side with the powerful, not to be neutral.","It is not systematic education which somehow molds society, but, on the contrary, society which, according to its particular structure, shapes education in relation to the ends and interests of those who control the power in that society.","The trust of the people in the leaders reflects the confidence of the leaders in the people.","Education must begin with the solution of the student-teacher contradiction, by reconciling the poles of the contradiction so that both are simultaneously teachers and students.","Every society needs to examine itself in relation to other societies.","It is absolutely essential that the oppressed participate in the revolutionary process with an increasingly critical awareness of their role as subjects of the transformation.","Manipulation, sloganizing, depositing, regimentation, and prescription cannot be components of revolutionary praxis, precisely because they are the components of the praxis of domination.","Revolution is born as a social entity within the oppressor society.","I am an educator who thinks globally.","Those truly committed to liberation must reject the banking concept in its entirety, adopting instead a concept of women and men as conscious beings and consciousness as consciousness intent upon the world.","How can the oppressed, as divided, unauthentic beings, participate in developing the pedagogy of their liberation?","Just as it is important in Latin America to discuss ideas that come from North America, I think it is interesting for North Americans to discuss ideas that come from Latin America or Africa and do not insert themselves into capitalist interests.","It's no sin to make a critical study of Brazil's reality. A small percentage own land. Most people don't.","At times, I have been criticized by some philosophers of education, who place me in postures that they classify pejoratively as 'revolutionary.' But I have had the satisfaction of being invited to work in societies making progressive efforts without wavering. They were changing, and so they called on me."],"Pauly D":["I love being on tour and having my own tour bus.","I basically taught myself how to DJ, but I've been inspired by DJs throughout my whole career. I have some good friends that would hook us up with music. You learn some little things here and there from each DJ and you just take it and put your own style into to it.","I look back at my elementary or high school pictures and I always had gel in my hair and a gold chain that I would wear outside my shirt. That's how I was born and raised as an Italian male, and I always considered myself a Guido, anyway.","I really admire David Guetta; he's an unbelievable DJ and I love his style, his music and everything like that. So I look up to him.","I've always been loud.","Before 'Jersey Shore,' I was a DJ struggling to promote, deejaying six nights a week and hustling to pack clubs.","I have family in Italy that my mother keeps in contact with, but I don't because I don't speak Italian.","I will do 'Dancing with the Stars' when my career dips.","My mother got me into music when I was a little kid. She used to play music, blast it, when she was cleaning the house, while I was crawling around. I just love loud music.","I travel every single day, but I make it a point to hit the gym. I want to look good for the summer.","I really love Las Vegas. It's, like, my favorite place to be. I love to DJ out there. It is the place to be as a DJ.","I haven't gone sky diving yet and I want to do that, real bad. I love adrenaline and going fast.","I first got interested in DJing when I was a little kid. I just love music... Music's my passion; it's always been my whole life."],"Pauly Shore":["Serious and intense people, they drain you. But someone who's an idiot, like myself, they're fun. You either hate me or you love me.","When you're a kid, all you really care about are Slurpees and Slip N Slide and riding your bike, and that's what I did.","People should stop poking fun at other people and worry about themselves.","Few if any teenagers can relate to getting up for school and finding famous comics like Pryor and Williams hanging out in your living room after a hard night of partying. But that's Hollywood.","I don't think any of us would be who we are if our parents weren't who they were. People that are in show business, and their parents are not in show business, their parents probably motivated them to get in show business.","I miss that process of getting the script and reading it and working on it. Every actor has their own way of memorizing their lines, and the whole process of starting to work with the other actors and the director, and doing rehearsals, and going to the location, and going through wardrobe.","I really don't go out every night to red-carpet events.","'Entourage' is a staple L.A.-based show, and people say it's pretty real, and I thought it was. It's an exaggeration of the truth.","Everywhere I go, people know who I am.","I miss working with great actors, working with great directors.","I fly around with chicks on each arm and have no script. I just talk about what I feel like. But that's why my act works: I'm like this normal guy.","Even at my peak, I never went too over the top.","I'm not used to getting good reviews.","That's the biggest rule in Hollywood: Don't spend your own money.","Whenever someone dies everyone says, I love that guy, except for Jeffrey Dahmer.","My mom and dad are both in stand-up comedy, so that's where I started, that's where I got everything. My roots are holding the mic.","My mom is two people to me. She's my mom number one, and then she's this lady most comedians know as being a legendary owner of a nightclub that's responsible for starting a lot of heavy careers.","I was one of the first veejays to take the camera out on location, and that's what was unique about MTV at that time.","I'm Jewish. I've always had a thing where it's okay to dance with the devil, just don't become the devil. Even at my peak, I never went too over the top.","It's in my blood to tour. It's in my blood to get on the road. It's in my blood to go onstage.","I'm definitely a lot more comfortable now in my 40s than in my 30s - that's for sure.","My 20s were a time where I made it; my 30s were when I was away, confused, and trying to figure it all out.","Death isn't a funny thing. We're all lucky to be living.","The best comedy to me - and again, I grew up with comedy since I was a baby, so I've seen it all - is when you exaggerate the truth, like Richard Pryor did, you understand?","Comedy wasn't something I chose - it chose me.","The best part about stand-up is that you control everything. Period. When you work in movies, or on TV shows, there are 50 other people involved.","I giggle when I put myself down. It's just funny to me.","I think as a standup performer you have to feel the audience. So the audience kind of dictates what they get, you know?","In my 30s, it wasn't cool to like Pauly Shore movies. It was cool to like them when they came out, then it wasn't cool.","The public was used to a Pauly Shore film coming out every year or two, you understand? So when that went away, the public lost familiarity with me.","When you put yourself out into the world and say, 'Hey, look at me,' you're going to get criticized.","Comedy wasn't something I chose - it chose me. I was just inherently funny when I was a kid.","I think the best comedy comes from stuff that's based in reality.","I think you gotta look at stuff half-full as opposed to half-empty.","We all have a past; it's just that my past is out there for all to see.","I'm into politics - I'm interested in the election and how pissed off people get.","When you deal with a comedian who has a specific act, you can't hold 'em back. You got to work with 'em, dude. What you think, I'm just gonna do what's on the page, say 'yes sir, no sir'? I'm creatively beyond that.","I want to show all sides of myself. I mean, I don't want to howl at the moon my whole life, you know?","The best part about stand-up is that you control everything. Period.","When you work in movies, or on TV shows, there are 50 other people involved. And it's hard, man. They brainwash you to think you're doing the right thing.","I never made the movies for the critics; I've done the best I could with the material and the directors and the actors I had. But the thing that's really exciting is that once I do that one project that's different, that stands out, everyone's gonna be watching."],"Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece":["Growing up, it was very clear that I was a member of a royal family with a potential function later on. The question was: when and how and if?","Greeks have always been very confident, very strong people. That is - that is our real, I guess, benefit, is that we are independent thinkers. We will always get up on our feet. We - we sometimes act the best when we are downtrodden."],"Pawan Kalyan":["Caste is a delicate issue. It's ubiquitous, and we are full of it. We should start to change things from individual level. But when you go to people and deny caste, they may not react favourably. I think if a decisive percentage of people, especially elites, start marrying out of their caste, we may see a casteless India in a generation's time.","I never wanted to become an actor. I always wanted to be a farmer and dreamt of owning half an acre of agriculture land.","If I do not respond to some situation, my conscience kills me. I believe in permissible violence, not necessarily non-violence.","Life is bigger than cinema. Cinema is just a part of life, so I never take success or failure seriously.","I'm Indian. I care for our Motherland.","I feel the superstardom is God-given. I don't know how Pawanism came. I find it strange.","The revolution is not an apple that falls when it is ripe. You have to make it fall.","I have been a depressed kid. I wanted to lead a quiet life, never wanted to be an actor.","Societal good comes first for me.","We can't deny the existence of caste in India. We have to live with it.","Nature, philosophy and social issues are the three things that always occupy my mind. You do not have any power over others but can only change yourself.","I wanted to remain a bachelor from the beginning, but I got married thrice, and I don't know why I did it. I think it's not easy to live with me because of my impatience and busy schedules. Sometimes my mother is unhappy about a few decisions I have taken, but it is completely personal, and I don't want to make it public.","History and social sciences were my interests. I was always interested in knowing how societies get organized, why there is rich and poor divide, why there are classes. I was never apolitical. I think we are all political in a way. Politics decides our day-to-day life.","I certainly don't like to play a bad guy. There are no bad people. It's only shades of grey. Also, I am not a great actor who can transform completely into a totally different character for a movie. I am not a trained actor.","There is a latent talent in everyone. I am nothing extraordinary just because I happen to be an actor. Everybody is extraordinary in his own way. One must identify one's own talent early on - one is not great merely when he gets recognized by others - and one doesn't become a nobody just because his talent is not widely known.","Politics organizes our lives. We can't disregard it. Politics has lot of muck, lot of dirt. But that doesn't mean you have to be away from it. It's ubiquitous.","Many will call me an adventurer, and that I am, only one of a different sort: one of those who risks his skin to prove his platitudes.","I don't believe in planning for things. I just want them to fall in place, unfold as they like. I never design things. I want films to choose me; I don't choose films.","Right from my childhood, I have believed in a Supreme Power. I don't know whether it has form, or it is formless. I am a high school dropout. How come life has given me so much? It's not my intelligence, it's not my abilities. This understanding makes me scared even in success. I don't own my success. Neither do I own my failure.","As a public personality, I keep things related to my children and partner to myself. They are private matters.","For me, directing a film is like confining myself. I want to do something beyond direction. I can conceive stories, write screenplays, etc. That's better for me.","I have always wanted to be a gardener, and I love the time I spend in my garden.","It's destiny that pushed me towards showbiz. I wanted to start off as a technician, but out of compulsion, I became an actor.","Indian cinema needs all ingredients like emotion, action, sentiment and humour; it's not easy. It's easy to make a Hollywood film, as it goes with a pattern. Our cinema needs a lot of commercial ingredients. That's why I don't do many films.","I have a huge fan following in Bellary, and when they met me, they told me about their problems. I have seen mining done without proper safety measures and not taking environmental protection into account."],"Pawel Pawlikowski":["Just by my home is an entrance to the sewers they used in the Warsaw uprising. I grew up knowing people died down there. Warsaw was once a battleground; then it became a morgue. It's a city littered with ghosts. And that never left me.","I grew up in a secular environment, you know, in the '60s and '70s. My mother's family was Catholic, but you know, just very kind of conventionally Catholic. You know, nothing - there was nothing, you know, extreme about their version of religion. And my father was a free spirit, you know? He had no time for religion at all.","I dread to be compared to all these directors who have a lot of spontaneous emoting and swearing in their films - that is death; it's a cul-de-sac. It doesn't lift the material at all. It's just a cliched reproduction of what we think is normal behaviour.","It's so difficult to actually come up with ideas that you really fall in love with, you know? That's the most difficult thing about filmmaking - and that's my main challenge in life.","What's been lost is allowing cinema to be artful, playful, to have ambiguity, to have form, to be contemplative, to wish to be art. This slightly timeless approach to reality, like Chekhov in literature, where you look at all humanity and try to find what's transcendent.","Life is complicated, and art has the right to be complicated, too. I don't like films that simplify.","I'm so happy when someone does something original, and there's no focus group or planning committee. If the cinema doesn't get an injection of that once in a while, we're in trouble.","My films are always a reflection of where I am in my life.","I come from a magnetic field of Catholicism. I was baptised by my mother's family, who were all traditional Catholics. But my mother was the black sheep of the family - she ran away to the ballet at 17.","My father's mother was a secular Jew who died in Auschwitz. I only found out as an adult because my father never talked about it. He was a secularist and never defined himself in ethnic terms - partly, I think, because he was scared; partly out of the habit of not talking of such things; partly because he didn't like being defined by other people.","'Ida' doesn't set out to explain history. That's not what it's about. The story is focused on very concrete and complex characters who are full of humanity with all its paradoxes. They're not pawns used to illustrate some version of history or an ideology.","I'm not emotionally excited by the power of cinema's tricks anymore.","I don't know what directing actors is all about apart from just casting well and then shaping their performances a bit, you know.","For me, filmmaking is not exactly a career. I was never in it for Hollywood or anything. My films are markers of where I am in life, where I am in my head. So that's what I'm working on, and I try to keep things in proportion - life and filmmaking. One feeds into the other.","Art is not journalism. In art, you don't make it to convey a message.","'Ida' is about humanity, about guilt and forgiveness. It's not a film that deals with an issue as such. It's more universal.","The whole world, it's a problem that there's too much stuff being produced. We don't have time to reflect on the important things in life.","It's wonderful that Poland is free again and there's open debate and people can pursue their interests. I'm all for it.","I think - you know, the big trauma in my life, personally, was the fact that at 14, I was taken out of Poland unwittingly because my parents were divorced. Left the country - my mother left for England with her new husband. I wasn't even aware that she'd married him.","Strangely, you know, my parents, who left Poland separately and, you know, divorced, ended up marrying other people. But then they met again abroad, and they got together again.","One of my favorite writers is Chekhov. I love his attitude toward the world. Just accept things for what they are. Don't judge. Be moral as you tell your story, but have no moral at the end. Just look at it.","The documentaries I made were never normal documentaries. They were about subjects I was obsessed with, and I suppose I thought I could sculpt them. What I think I do with my fiction is the same.","I always thought that life is full of stories and characters that feel like literary stories and characters. So when I started making documentaries, they weren't humble empirical things, just following people around. I was always trying to impose a story.","A good script is like a work of art in itself. I've read hundreds of scripts, and good ones are very rare. If the writer has something to say, and a voice, and a plot that matches character, and an emotional trajectory that works, then I'd be an idiot to fool around with it. It's just that few scripts ever are like that.","When I write, I imagine scenes. I write things down. I take photographs. I do some casting. I rewrite. It's a permanent making or remaking.","For me, each film, each script is like a little journey in itself, and I'm reinventing the wheel. It's like, 'How do I make this film?' That's part of the pleasure, and that's why I'm not a normal professional director.","I lived a pretty chaotic life. I went to England, and I moved around, and there were a lot of things that I was interested in. I wrote poetry. I took photographs. I was a musician and all sorts of things. Nothing brilliant, but I did all these different things.","I actually studied literature and philosophy. So, when I started making films, I didn't really know what I was doing, and I was too proud and arrogant to learn.","I think people crave those meaningful situations, stuff about faith, identity, dilemmas of live paradoxes in our souls. It's going back to a time where lives were really defined by history, and also how you behave in the face of history. It's kind of interesting to go back to that simpler humanity, simpler but deeper.","I like to control my films from beginning to end, to write them the way I want.","I could never work in that kind of commercial environment where the stars have a lot to say, where the producers kind of push you around and tell you who to cast and who not to cast. I'm just not interested in that at all.","I love good TV shows, but it's not what I do. I kind of sculpt my films as I go along. And TV is all about writing, so you just shoot, shoot, shoot what's written.","My stupid ambition is to make a film that's not like any other - one that has its own kind of logic and hooks viewers without making them think too much. It's a film I'd love to see, one in which after 10 minutes the audience isn't able to predict the whole thing.","The problem with shooting in Paris is, it's been shot to death. When you're in it, you already think you're in a movie, so how do you get away from that feeling, and give some frisson to the viewer?","I try to turn a place on film into a mental state. I always have three or four locations that I repeat and return to in a film, to make it more mythic. But my fiction films are relatively subjective stories, experienced though one character. And that always justifies a little stylisation in terms of landscape.","In 2006, I started making a film called 'Restraint of Beasts.' While I was making it, I had a personal disaster. My wife fell ill, so we stopped shooting halfway through. And then sadly, my wife died.","I connect with all of the characters in my films. That's what makes you want to make a film, that you can enter the mindset, the situation, the conflict, the contradictions.","It's much better to write a book and stick to the research - that's history. In cinema, emotional truth and psychological truth is much more important.","I love films that are many things at the same time while being simple.","The most interesting stuff happens when an authoritarian government removes itself a little and gives this margin of freedom. And then art is grabbed with both hands.","For me, good films and good books are irreducible to a lesson. You can't just kind of translate them into one statement. On the contrary, the more you do that, the less wisdom in art there is.","For me, actors have to have a character, an aura, body language. They're not models. They used to call actors models. But I want them to participate in the film.","I always write three or four projects at the same time. They're stories that I want to tell, and usually I dump them unfinished for the next one in order not to get too cornered and depressed about it.","I'm a pretty chaotic person, but I'm also a perfectionist. It's a very unfortunate mix.","The luxury that I have is I'm not career-minded, I just live from one film to the next. For a time, I was making documentaries, and all my documentaries were winning awards and stuff, and then I lost interest in documentaries.","With documentaries, what's beautiful about them is that you capture something unique in a shot, something that will never repeat itself.","'The Restraint of Beasts' is a painful subject. We'd shot 60% of the film when I had to stop. The material looks great, like nothing I've ever done or even seen before. It could have been really great, definitely original.","To cast Ida, it took ages, and I was a bit desperate. I couldn't find somebody I could believe in. I spent months looking for the lead among young actresses and drama students.","I'm more interested in people the way they are than what they've done onscreen before. So I don't worry much about the acting skills or the name, the status. I just think, 'Do I believe this person? Do I like them? Are they interesting, complicated, have the right aura, energy?'","I don't think women are that vastly different from men. I'm a bit of a woman myself. But I'm not a feminist filmmaker. I'm not making a feminist thesis to prove that women are important. I just happen to make films with strong characters that are women.","In America, I don't think you have the creative freedom that I'm used to. Traditionally, it's a producer's cinema here.","I grew up cinematically in the '70s. I was watching a lot of Godard, Bresson, Dreyer, and all sorts of old films and the Czech New Wave.","Every good film is a bit like a dream, when you come away from it. That's what you should aspire to, rather than some social document. I want to create a little world that will stay with the audience.","If you wanted to make a film about British teenagers, it would be... well, it wouldn't interest me; let's put it like that. They'd be listening to music I hate, watching TV all the time, and talking about 'Big Brother.'"],"Payal Kadakia":["Be true to yourself and surround yourself with positive, supportive people.","I believe you win the race by looking forward, not behind.","Having challenges in your life open doors for you.","I think, as a founder and entrepreneur, you just keep hustling through it.","To me, I will be a stronger person if I'm moving forward, doing the work I want, and continue to drive: force the purpose that I want to create versus doing what other people think I should be doing, which is never a way to live.","Surround yourself with people who only lift you higher.","Millennials are a bit more free-spirited, more able to go into new places, to feel more assertive and fearless about trying new things.","I get bursts of creativity with bursts of physical activity.","Dance has always been the center of who I am. It has given me the inspiration to help other people find a hobby, passion, and activity that fulfills them. It also taught me some of the many skills I need as an entrepreneur: a hard work ethic that takes practice to master and the confidence to persevere through any challenges.","I reason that as long as I'm smiling 90 percent of the time, I can handle the setbacks that occur 10 percent of the time.","I thought, 'I have ideas. I'm creative.' I just didn't see why I should be pigeon-holing myself in the business world or staying in corporate America when I already knew that I was capable of taking risks.","I work out once a day - it's built into my ethos.","The only way to do everything in your life is to find awesome people to lean on so you can focus your time.","Failure is an amazing data point that tells you which direction not to go.","Surround yourself with people who lift you higher.","I want little girls to believe that they can be CEOs.","I plan my time to a 'T.' I plan when I am going to sleep; I plan when I am going to relax. I obviously leave time to have spontaneous life experiences - I think that's really important. But so much of it is setting up you mental energy in the right way to get the most out of your day and time.","What's crucial is to never get stuck. Making hard decisions is such an important part of being a startup in order to keep moving forward.","When I started fundraising like me and leading like me, that's when I really started to shine and find my own rhythm.","I never feel bad. You can't feel bad - you have to just make the best decision you can at the time you're in and be like, 'That's the decision I believe in.'","If you love what you do, it's not work.","It's OK when something doesn't work. It gives you another data point when things do work.","I want to stay active. I want to find that mind-body connection every single day, and I want other people to have that because we spend our lives on our phones, at our desks. We're not thinking about our bodies and the mental connections we should be having, and those moments help us push through to live our best life.","The worst thing you can do is sit there and do nothing, right?","The best thing I could do is build a successful company and continue to innovate and be in the right role I want to be in. If I'm not doing that, I'm inauthentic. That's not a good role model to anyone. That, to me, is the most important thing.","It's about knowing yourself and what you're good at. Females, males - anyone can be anything they want to be.","The impact we have on people's lives, to me, is more important than any title anyone can carry.","You can always change your branding or hire lawyers, but it's critical that you figure out if you have product market fit, and if you don't, figure out how to course-correct without getting stuck.","Movement inspires a lot in me.","You make sure to set True Norths for your company. You can't be involved in every decision and every meeting; you have to make sure the mission is very built into the culture, the product, and how you communicate.","I am anal about my Gmail calendar. It's my life. I put everything in there - my to-do list, or even if I want to do things.","I work out once a day. When I'm in a massive dance show mode, I'll probably be active for about 20 hours each week.","I set goals for myself every three months. I write them down.","There are so many times when I think I don't have time to dance, but I force it into my life because I know it's so important.","Every moment you wake up and you want to go for a run, or you want to take a class, you should be able to just go.","We want people to be active so you'll be happier and be more yourself.","Sometimes people go to a yoga class and think it's not for them, but it might just not be the right studio or teacher - try a new one!","The variety and flexibility of ClassPass is limitless, ensuring that you'll never get bored, and neither will your muscles.","When I dance, I go to a different side of who I am. I feel like I can solve a problem without knowing I'm solving one.","I love meeting our users and partners and talking to them about how ClassPass has made an impact.","Every day is quite unique, which is one of my favorite things!","I travel pretty frequently, but a few things that are routine are going for a run, getting my green tea in the morning, and checking email... well, all the time!","I like to work out every single day. And it's about movement.","Sometimes females feel like they should act like men, but they should really just be themselves.","I'm 4'11\", but that doesn't matter if I'm showing conviction and confidence in what I'm doing.","It's really lonely trying to build something by yourself. It's good to have thought partners to bounce ideas off of.","Growing up as a South Asian-American, I didn't have any female role models.","I needed to build a product that got people back to working out.","I will always do what's best for the company.","We're encouraged by the engagement on ClassPass and the tremendous growth we've had that shows we are fulfilling our mission of helping people live a more active life.","I think I learned to overcome some things in life through dance.","Being a dancer or athlete of any type teaches you the fundamentals of discipline... and the ability to know you can grow.","I love barre because even when I'm not dancing, I feel like I'm training those same muscles.","Every person is different and unique. I am a female. I'm Indian. I'm 4'11\". People should never be defined by what they look like and sort of these demographical parts about them, but the most important thing is the work you do, so females are just as capable as doing that as males, and the same thing with any other person out there.","It's really about if you do the work. Work hard; your results will speak for themselves.","I think it's so important to have a great support network when you feel like you can't - I would actually go and talk to the people who tell you that you can.","In a startup, there have to be challenges. Otherwise, someone else would have done it already. And that's almost the most exciting part.","We stipulate about where we need to be in life: By this age you should be married, by this age you should have kids. But it's not that you can only do this or only do that. It's really about creating a holistic life: about planning ahead and being efficient with your time and really listening to yourself.","You should wake up in the morning and say, 'What do I want to do today? What's going to make me happy?'","Any time you find yourself doing something out of obligation, that's a time you should start questioning whether you're spending your time wisely.","I'm an artist in my heart.","As long as I'm building and doing what I want to do, that's the only thing that matters.","I'm not going out there screaming, 'I'm CEO! I'm CEO!' That's not the way to do it.","Founders are exceptional, and they all want to go back to creating. And I feel privileged to be able to do that.","You can't replicate Seamless or OpenTable for another industry.","When I first started out, there were times I would dress or act in a way because I thought it was expected of me or that people would take me more seriously. But once I started leading in a way that was authentically me, that is when I really started to see success.","You need people to encourage you along the way, both during your success and failures, because there will be both.","When it's time to recharge, I don't feel guilty about it.","The more you practice something, the easier it'll become.","We never would have built ClassPass if I hadn't learned so much from the Classtivity experience.","I truly believe that everyone can be creative; you just need to find your form of expression.","No business is good when, on the last day of the month, you're like, 'What was the usage for the month?'","I think I had a lot of people who were like, 'Payal, we love you, but product's not there,' or 'business is not there.' I never gave up, though.","I always say investors invest in lines, not dots.","I remember going out to raise my Series A and ending up with multiple term sheets when I had gone to Silicon Valley probably four times at that point and coming back with nothing.","My assumption was that people are already motivated to go to a fitness class. That's who I am. I was already ready to go out there and get to class. All I needed was a search tool. But it turns out people need more than that, and that's why gym memberships exist.","I basically live in workout clothes.","Some people have that school of thought where fitness isn't enjoyable, but we're making it enjoyable, I think, by making it more fun, challenging, and engaging rather than this boring thing that you have to do. It's about using technology and data to change this experience.","We want you to find that thing that will make your life better.","We're not trying to be Nike. It's about evolving into new products that are going to make people's lives better.","Without a story, people aren't going to connect to what you're telling, what you have a pain point about. It's so important for them to know why you've created the company, without that connection to the broader vision that you have - why are you going to do it? What are you going to accomplish?","I think, when I see entrepreneurs, they tend to talk about the market and the industry - which is obviously very important, but the most important thing is you're product. What are you selling? And does it really have product-market fit?","You need to keep having data points of progress, so even if an investor - and we've all had investors say no to us - there are times where you go back, and you keep them in the loop, and you keep telling them the progress and the perseverance you have.","You have to learn to sell yourself. I think people forget they need to look at where else they've really performed in their life, where they've been in a place where they were confident.","Working out is so mentally and physically important.","As we've got more data, and ClassPass has grown, we've had to change rather than have a one-size fits all approach.","Focus on your product. A lot of people focus on the name of their brand or the legal aspects, but it's more important to create your product. It's why people join. It's your vision. Without your product, nothing is going to happen.","In running my own company, I was too busy for a while, and I thought, 'Maybe I'll stop dancing for a bit.' It was the worst decision ever. I just lost my creativity and my drive.","ClassPass, to me, is people are choosing a lifestyle to live; it's saying, 'Yes, I want to work out and live my healthiest happiest.'","I remember, at MIT, we had to write an essay about something mathematical that you do in your extra time. I basically wrote about how dance, to me, was geometry: it was all shapes.","When I was 5 years old, I saw people dancing in my head. In college, I would choreograph for the cultural shows, and in my notes, I would actually create formations of people. It was how my whole brain worked.","If you feel good, it doesn't matter what you're wearing.","Allowing our staff to mix their life with work only makes them more productive and in love with the work that they're doing.","I want our staff to be able to feel like themselves.","Whenever people are trying to give you money, and you're like, 'No! Don't,' you have to stop and consider, what am I saying no to?","When something is aspirational, you don't want someone to be thinking about payment every single time.","If I exercise once or twice a day on vacation and don't want to wash my hair too often. I pack a lot of dry shampoo, like Amika's.","People saw more magic in me than I saw.","You need to find that thing that's going to get you through your day and that you're excited about. No day should ever be lived without feeling like it was a fulfilling day. You need to set yourself up for that."],"Payne Stewart":["People who have never had an addiction don't understand how hard it can be.","But in the end it's still a game of golf, and if at the end of the day you can't shake hands with your opponents and still be friends, then you've missed the point.","We live in such a sheltered environment in the United States. I've been fortunate enough to have traveled all over the world, and I've seen things you only read about and see on the news.","Tiger is the greatest thing that's happened to the tour in a long time. He has brought incredible attention to golf at a time of year when football and the World Series always take precedence. Everything I've heard about him seems to be true.","But I'll tell you something: We had a big family discussion about it recently, my two sisters and I, and I pointed out that we all have the same genes as our mother and we're all susceptible to becoming alcoholics.","For a while, I think in 1994, it got to where I didn't want to practice.","For example, I wouldn't hesitate to sit somebody down if he wasn't performing, even if he was the No. 1 player in the world. I've been sat down before.","For one thing, when you're playing as well as I was at the time, you think you can play with anything. That isn't true, of course, but I didn't know it then.","For sure I would be a very emotional captain. A very hands-on captain.","I didn't hesitate to kiss my father in public. And that's how I tried to raise my children. We're physical.","I don't read magazines much, and I have an awful time with books.","I don't think it's healthy to take yourself too seriously.","I sometimes got distracted easily and allowed my mind to wander when I needed to be focused. It's quite subtle, really, and just being aware of it helps.","I very rarely saw Tom Kite around. I've talked to Tom about it. I don't think Michael Jordan needed to be on the captain's cart with Kite; he needed to be walking in the gallery, supporting them from outside the ropes.","I went over before the British Open and played Valderrama thinking that I might make the team, might be a captain's pick. I made the effort to go over there.","I'm 42 now, what I would consider prime time.","I've just become more conscious about how much I do drink and how often I want to have a drink and things like that. I think being conscious of it will help me to control the urges.","If somebody asks for my opinion, I tell them my opinion, whether it's what they want to hear or not.","If you can't laugh at yourself, then how can you laugh at anybody else? I think people see the human side of you when you do that.","Invariably something happens at a U.S. Open where the golf course gets out of control one day, they have one pin that's out of control. It always seems to happen. But they've gotten better about the height of the rough.","Not that money is a driving force. It's an honor to play for your country.","Raymond Floyd. The man knows how to control situations. He was experienced. He didn't let me get overly excited; he kept me in check. It allowed me to free myself up, and I played really well with him.","That's why I'm very proud of being American. I'm proud to pay taxes. I pay a lot of taxes, but it sure beats the alternative.","The cast clubs were a big part of it, too. I found I wasn't getting that instant feedback I was used to with a forged blade. The sweet spot is a shade bigger, and when I didn't hit the ball dead center, I didn't know it, because it still felt great.","The two-piece ball I switched to spun too much. One shot would go the distance I thought it should, then the next one would fall short, and then the next one would go long.","Then I would have an occasional cigarette and then I started back dipping. I started dipping last year. My family has asked me again to stop, and I'm trying my best to do that.","These guys who keep on playing but aren't winning, you've got to sit them down and let them figure it out and perform a little gut-check on themselves.","This thing is for the game of golf, yeah, but trust me, the Europeans don't have that mentality.","We grew up with so much love in our family.","With the media, I could be quick and ugly and critical.

All sin is easy after that.","People see God every day, they just don't recognize him.","You never find yourself until you face the truth.","There's a period of life when we swallow a knowledge of ourselves and it becomes either good or sour inside.","Everybody wants to do something to help, but nobody wants to be first.","When you're young, the silliest notions seem the greatest achievements.","Sometimes I would almost rather have people take away years of my life than take away a moment.","You cannot belong to anyone else, until you belong to yourself.","To talk to someone who does not listen is enough to tense the devil.","Hungry people cannot be good at learning or producing anything, except perhaps violence.","I never really look for anything.

It creates a sense of shared community for the time of the performance that hopefully carries over into other aspects of the audience's life because they have shared this experience together.","Many times, what people call 'writer's block' is the confusion that happens when a writer has a great idea, but their writing skill is not up to the task of putting that idea down on paper. I think that learning the craft of writing is critical.","I've always loved the '40s romantic comedies and the idea of those mistaken identities and lovers' misunderstandings.","Putting words on paper regularly is part of the necessary discipline of writing. A journal is a great way to do that.","I've never been to Paris. I don't like to fly!","I think the black community is no different from any other community.

We need to be personally responsible for keeping our streets clean, our schools safe, and our houses peaceful.","As African-Americans, we often spend our time and energy blaming other people for the problems we see around us.","I really love writing comedy. Writing romantic comedy is even nicer because you get to write about how insane we all act when we're falling in love.","I truly love the rehearsal process, those eight hours a day! I really love actors.","I'm not one of those playwrights who says, 'Show up, hit your marks, and don't talk to me!' I always want to hear from the other artists involved, whether it's the director, the lighting tech, or the actors.","When you're writing first person, all I can see and tell as the author is what that main character can see.","I think one of the things that writers and creative artists generally have to deal with is the censors that we have in our heads, the voices that we have that say you better not tell that and don't tell that, and people will think you're not a good girl, and your grandmother's going to be mad at you and all of those things.","When you sit down to write, you have to be prepared to strip all of those voices away, all of the censors away, and talk about what you think the truth is, which I think is really the task of the writer - to get to the truth.","I was raised in a very activist household so that I grew up surrounded by people who were activists.","I didn't have a dream of being a press secretary, I had a dream of being a playwright; I had a dream of being a novelist and a poet.","I worked in Maynard Jackson's first campaign, and I remember the excitement we felt when he won.","That's why I love being a writer. My imagination can take me places I may never see except in my mind's eye.","Most of us, I think, are conscious of history swirling around outside the door, but when we're in the house, we're usually not dealing with history. We're not thinking about history.","Denzel Washington is a big Hollywood movie star now. But he started out as an actor in the Negro Ensemble company."],"Pearl Mackie":["For me, personally, I didn't see many people like me on TV growing up.","I'm incredibly excited to be joining the 'Doctor Who' family. It's such an extraordinary British institution, I couldn't be prouder to call the TARDIS my home.","Peter Capaldi is such a brilliant actor, and his Doctor is such a wacky and wonderful character, I can't wait to see what adventures are in store for him and Bill throughout time and space.","I've always been attracted to music, and women like Aretha Franklin, Beyonce, Nina Simone, Ella Fitzgerald and Tina Turner showed the path, in a way. They're all tough women but not afraid to be vulnerable. They made me feel someone like me could do that.","I always loved stage combat at drama school so I can't wait to get on set and kick some evil monsters into the next dimension!"],"Pearl S. Buck":["Love alone could waken love.","If you want to understand today, you have to search yesterday.","To find joy in work is to discover the fountain of youth.","Our society must make it right and possible for old people not to fear the young or be deserted by them, for the test of a civilization is the way that it cares for its helpless members.","Some are kissing mothers and some are scolding mothers, but it is love just the same, and most mothers kiss and scold together.","The secret of joy in work is contained in one word - excellence.

I am so absorbed in the wonder of earth and the life upon it that I cannot think of heaven and angels.","The basic discovery about any people is the discovery of the relationship between men and women.","Let woman out of the home, let man into it, should be the aim of education. The home needs man, and the world outside needs woman.","We send missionaries to China so the Chinese can get to heaven, but we won't let them into our country.","Nothing and no one can destroy the Chinese people. They are relentless survivors.","What is a neglected child? He is a child not planned for, not wanted. Neglect begins, therefore, before he is born.","The young do not know enough to be prudent, and therefore they attempt the impossible - and achieve it, generation after generation.","If our American way of life fails the child, it fails us all.","Life without idealism is empty indeed. We just hope or starve to death.","I don't wait for moods. You accomplish nothing if you do that. Your mind must know it has got to get down to work.","None who have always been free can understand the terrible fascinating power of the hope of freedom to those who are not free.","Nothing in life is as good as the marriage of true minds between man and woman. As good? It is life itself.","All things are possible until they are proved impossible - and even the impossible may only be so, as of now.","Chinese are wise in comprehending without many words what is inevitable and inescapable and therefore only to be borne.","Men and women should own the world as a mutual possession.","Truth is always exciting. Speak it, then; life is dull without it.","Men would rather be starving and free than fed in bonds.","A dog barks when his master is attacked. I would be a coward if I saw that God's truth is attacked and yet would remain silent.","I am mentally bifocal.","Growth itself contains the germ of happiness.","Order is the shape upon which beauty depends.","Praise out of season, or tactlessly bestowed, can freeze the heart as much as blame.","It may be that religion is dead, and if it is, we had better know it and set ourselves to try to discover other sources of moral strength before it is too late.","Like Confucius of old, I am so absorbed in the wonder of the earth and the life upon it, that I cannot think of heaven and the angels.","In a mood of faith and hope my work goes on. A ream of fresh paper lies on my desk waiting for the next book.

It is awful to see the lean hands of dotage making a coffer of the grave.","The person who tries to live alone will not succeed as a human being.

You simply race through the reels.","Why should I have my picture taken when I can get paid for it?"],"Pedro Almodovar":["Cinema can fill in the empty spaces of your life and your loneliness.","You can make a thousand different movies about the same subject.","I think it's a change that I did not intend at the time but it is clear that, from The Flower of My Secret on, there is a change in my films. A lot of the journalists have very generously attributed this to my growing maturity.","Hospitals are places that you have to stay in for a long time, even if you are a visitor. Time doesn't seem to pass in the same way in hospitals as it does in other places. Time seems to almost not exist in the same way as it does in other places.","I also wanted to express the strength of cinema to hide reality, while being entertaining. Cinema can fill in the empty spaces of your life and your loneliness.","I was born at a bad time for Spain, but a really good one for cinema.","After the enormous success of All About my Mother, all the awards and everything, I wanted to start a movie in exactly the same place that I used to be before. I wanted to show that all of the success had not changed my perception.","Yes, women are stronger than us. They face more directly the problems that confront them, and for that reason they are much more spectacular to talk about. I don't know why I am more interested in women, because I don't go to any psychiatrists, and I don't want to know why.","My directors of photography light my films, but the colours of the sets, furnishings, clothes, hairstyles - that's me. Everything that's in front of the camera, I bring you.","The problem is that I work in more than one genre. It's impossible for me to aim for a single one because, for me, comedy is mixed with tragedy. That's very Spanish, the way in which comedy and tragedy are inextricable from each other.","Whenever I arrive on a real location, I have to move around and work out what the best angles are going to be. When I was moving around with the lens, I discovered things that the naked eye would not have.","Even though I love my mother, I didn't want to make an idealized portrait of her. I'm fascinated more by her defects - they are funnier than her other qualities.","I don't want to imitate life in movies; I want to represent it. And in that representation, you use the colors you feel, and sometimes they are fake colors. But always it's to show one emotion.","The challenge to me as a director was for the audience to see the film as going on in a straight line, so that they did not sense all of these break-ups. I did not want a film to be a collage of all these images.","The silent film has a lot of meanings. The first part of the film is comic. It represents the burlesque feel of those silent films. But I think that the second part of the film is full of tenderness and emotion.","La Mancha is a very macho, chauvinistic society. I saw very clearly that my life had to be in Madrid, and I liberated myself from my mum and dad after high school.","Already when I was very young, I was a fabulador. I loved to give my own version of stories that everybody already knew.","Whenever I arrive on a real location, I have to move around and work out what the best angles are going to be.","All my movies are difficult to classify because they are very eclectic in mixing genres.","Cukor is one of my favorite directors. He was a master at directing women.","I think decor says a lot about someone's social position, their taste, their sensibility, their work - and also about the aesthetic way I have chosen to tell their story.","I think that the consciousness of passion makes you act very differently.","I used this line to demonstrate how important colors are in movies: It's not a caprice.","In fact, it was the women in our house who were in the saddle. If men are the gods, women are not only the presidents but all the ministers of the government.","It's a pity that I can never really enjoy my movies because, after the mixing, your capacity as a spectator just disappears. I have to think about what I felt just before the mixing.","The 1980s really ended for me in 1992 with the film Kika.","The Flower of My Secret is definitely more based in true emotions. I also wanted to make something more realistic, but not naturalistic or simple.","With this silent film, I wanted to hide what was going on in the clinic. I wanted to cover it up in the best cinematic way and in an entertaining manner.","All my movies have an autobiographical dimension, but that is indirectly, through the personages. In fact, I am behind everything that happens and that is said, but I am never talking about myself in first person singular.","Cinema has become my life. I don't mean a parallel world, I mean my life itself. I sometimes have the impression that the daily reality is simply there to provide material for my next film.","Before shooting, I prepare with the actors much more like it's a theater play than a movie. Apparently, that way of working is very unusual.","I remember myself at 10 years old telling stories to my sisters and brother. This is something I did through my adolescence and even through my twenties.","If I had not been successful as a director, then I'm sure I would still be telling stories. I would have continued on 16mm or found a different medium through which to tell them.","I think my films are always political, even if I don't put explicitly political things in them.","If I make a movie in English, the money will come from Europe, so that I can keep my independence and freedom. The way they produce in Hollywood doesn't fit me.","Broadway musicals, where you sing the whole time, I really don't like; I like alternating dialogue and music.","There's something about uninterrupted singing that just doesn't work for me, because at some point, I need my characters to talk. Without meaning to offend anyone, a musical like 'Les Miserables' would be the last thing I'd ever be interested in.","My first memory is of the eyes of my brother; he was looking at me all the time.","Of course I want my films to look really good, but every single element is chosen for a reason. It's telling something in the story.","I'm an artist, and I'm part of every decision in a movie.","The life I live due to my work is difficult to share.","I am partly not conscious of structure with my movies, but this is when I am writing. I leave my mind very free, and then I correct it after.","I think that there is always a part of utopia in any romantic relationship.","For there to be communication within a couple, it is enough for there to be only one person who communicates or who really wants to communicate. Even though a couple consists of two people, if one of the people in a couple puts all their effort into moving a couple along they will move along.","When I make a film, the mixing process is very long, and you hear and watch the material in every form, so that totally shreds your ability to perceive it. So after the mixing, there's no way I can have the emotions or the reactions to my films in the same way.","I ask myself questions that journalists don't dare to ask or don't know how to ask.","My mother was an extremely creative woman, despite the fact that she lived the life of a rural housewife.","If I'd lived like my characters, I would have been dead before I'd made 16 films."],"Pedro Calderon de la Barca":["Green is the prime color of the world, and that from which its loveliness arises.","What is life? A madness. What is life? An illusion, a shadow, a story. And the greatest good is little enough; for all life is a dream, and dreams themselves are only dreams.","When love is not madness, it is not love.","A good action is never lost; it is a treasure laid up and guarded for the doer's need.","One may know how to gain a victory, and know not how to use it.","For even in dreams a good deed is not lost.","But whether it be dream or truth, to do well is what matters. If it be truth, for truth's sake. If not, then to gain friends for the time when we awaken.","These flowers, which were splendid and sprightly, waking in the dawn of the morning, in the evening will be a pitiful frivolity, sleeping in the cold night's arms.","What law, what reason can deny that gift so sweet, so natural that God has given a stream, a fish, a beast, a bird?","'Tis not where we lie, but whence we fell; the loss of heaven's the greatest pain in hell.","For all life is a dream, and dreams themselves are only dreams."],"Pedro Martinez":["I had the opportunity to go with some other teams. But I didn't consider those teams to be contenders, and I was right.","Only God knows why I didn't make it with the Mets, but yes, in a short period of time, I got the opportunity with the Phillies.","If I wanted to pitch that bad, I probably would. But I don't think I'm in that stage.","I wasn't playing mind games with anybody, I just said what I said. I am responsible for it, but I wish everybody would fall asleep for that one and let me go out there and do my thing.","I understand business and understand the ugly face of baseball, which is the business part of baseball.","You have to execute. You have to sacrifice your body.","I keep active because I have not announced my retirement, because that is something that takes time and you have to plan it. Plus, it is something that the Dominican people expected.","I get a lot of kids distracted. Sometimes they got to go cover left field, but they're over here talking to me, getting an autograph.","I just try to do what I have to do and let the people out there do what they have to do, which is have fun, scream, yell and jump around. I try to do what I have to do, which is play baseball, and I can only play in that piece of area there, so that's what I try to do.","I believe that if you're healthy, you're capable of doing everything. There's no one else who can give you health but God, and by being healthy I believe that God is listening to me.","Actually the adrenaline of the game will probably help me out a little bit to regain command and concentration about the things that I have to do.","None of the teams that actually probably were offering me a job from the getgo, actually in spring training, are in the playoffs right now.","My brother never got an opportunity to throw a pitch, and I didn't want the same thing to happen to another young kid.","Before, if I wasn't in baseball, I wanted to become a doctor.","I doubt that I will get involved with politics. That's something I don't have in me.","If you want to follow some good steps, it would Proverbs, all over.","I'm thankful for not ever taking anything illegal.","Some other things I don't miss: the media and the pressure of just being asked to do, and being asked questions every day.","I do miss competing, being out there - the atmosphere, I do miss it.","Some of the things I've done are really special.","The game doesn't change.","My first ball I ever got from a Big League player I actually got to purchase in Dodger Stadium in a silent auction, was Reggie Jackson.","Whether you like it or not, the last few years I'd be the first one to tell you I haven't been the Pedro Martinez that I'm used to being.","I'm open to play for anybody that would give me respect, treat me the right way, and actually going to make me feel comfortable."],"Pedro Pascal":["I have the cliche 'struggling actor' story. I was waiting tables in New York, went out to L.A. soon after graduation to get some jobs, but it didn't work out. I wanted to cut my teeth in professional theater, so I came back to New York. It made my journey a longer one, but I really wanted to excel in the theater.","The acting training in school was great, but it was mostly fun being young and in New York. Because my upbringing was so transient, New York ended up being my home. I've been living in New York longer than I have anywhere else in my life.","The only thing that being killed off on 'Graceland' helped me with on 'Game of Thrones' is that it made me available to actually do the job.","I am such a 'True Detective' fan. I was anticipating it each Sunday as it came. I'm kind of a sci-fi fan. I was really hooked on the 'Battlestar Galactica' series. I think I owned every box set of 'Battlestar Galactica.' I also really love 'Bob's Burgers.'","My family is Chilean, and I was born there. By the time I was four, we were living in San Antonio, Texas, and I just remember picking a blue bonnet and getting yelled at by some guy with a sheriff hat and a badge. I was traumatized. He told me it was the state flower, and I wasn't supposed to be messin' with it.","I have really fond memories of Texas. By the time I was eight, we started to go back to Chile very regularly, and many family members came to visit us because we couldn't go visit them.","I just went to your typical public schools, and my dad would take us to the movies every week, or he'd buy scalped tickets to San Antonio Spurs games. I remember I was four or five years old and my parents, who were very young, took us to see The Police in Austin, and Iggy Pop opened."],"Pedro Pierluisi":["The government of Puerto Rico has every right to hold a plebiscite, to consult the people of Puerto Rico regarding their wishes. But the truth is that for a change in the status of Puerto Rico to happen, you need both Congress and Puerto Rico agreeing to it.","After four centuries of Spanish rule, Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States in 1898. Residents were granted U.S. citizenship in 1917, and the federal government has allowed Puerto Rico to exercise authority over its local affairs in a manner similar to the 50 states.","Puerto Rico loses out on billions of dollars annually because it is treated unequally under a range of federal programs, including tax credits available to millions of households in the States that do not pay federal income taxes.","Puerto Rico has two divergent paths forward. After a reasonable transition period, it could become a state. Or it can become a sovereign nation.","A territory cannot become a state or a nation unless Congress approves legislation and the president signs it."],"Pedro Reyes":["I definitely believe that art is the best way to produce social change.","Architects often have a mindset where you solve a problem, so you have a set of needs that you have to address. Often I feel that my projects have to have concrete applications.","In the end, a gun is an instrument to make someone surrender to your will or die, and music is exactly the opposite - it's seductive and invitational.","A weapon kills people and makes people in cities dominated by fear. But if you turn it into an instrument, it's like social gold. It brings people together and you build trust.","The role of TV at the core of the family is that of an electric nanny.","If people can keep track of all the celebrity gossip, there's no reason we can't also assimilate the key concepts of economic philosophy."],"Pee Wee Reese":["I had only played five games in my senior year in high school. I was not large enough. Hell, when I graduated, I was about five foot four and weighed 120 pounds. I didn't go with the Dodgers until spring training of 1940 and I weighed all of 155 pounds soaking wet.","Being Captain of the Dodgers meant representing an organization committed to winning and trying to keep it going. We could have won every year if the breaks had gone right.","Brooklyn was the most wonderful city a man could play in, and the fans there were the most loyal there were.","If I had my career to play over, one thing I'd do differently is swing more. Those 1,200 walks I got, nobody remembers them.","If you rush in and out of the clubhouse, you rush in and out of baseball.","Why did they do it? Beats the hell out of me. I was just a scared kid from Kentucky, and these guys had been up in the majors for a while. I guess it was because I was just such a helluva nice kid - if you'll accept that.","I used to tell Jackie (Robinson) sometimes when they were throwing at him, 'Jackie, they aren't throwing at you because you are black. They are throwing at you because they don't like you."],"Peer Steinbruck":["I would happily help to turn the stone being thrown at me into a boomerang.","Greece will not manage to get back on its feet without restructuring its debt. There is no way around it. The country's creditors will have to reduce a portion of its debts by extending maturity dates, lowering interest rates or giving them what's called a 'haircut' in financial jargon.","One has to explain to people that the EU in this form is the answer both to 1945 and to the 21st century, in a dramatically altered world with new heavyweights, and that Germany benefits from the continued integration of Europe in political, economic and societal ways. And, of course, that means the Germans will have to pay.","When I look at the chaotic and volatile debate right now, both in Germany and around the world, my impression and concern is that the daily barrage of proposals and political statements is making markets and consumers even more nervous. Still, Brussels is pressing for a joint European approach.","Europe is difficult to coordinate, and our main deficit may not even lie in this area of finance and economics, but in foreign and security policy. We have a leadership problem because we are still 27 different members who have still not decided on how to work with each other based on what we used to call a European constitution.","There are still deep-seated structural problems that threaten the economic balance in the world: Between the United States and China, for example, but also within Europe. We have taken a few steps toward taming the financial markets, but we haven't come nearly far enough to rule out a repetition of the crisis.","When I look at how the banking world has changed and at the role Chinese banks, for example, play today, Germany, as an export-oriented economy, should be pleased to have a major global player in its camp.","The euro is a vital issue for Germany. There is no other country that derives as much benefit from the common domestic market and the monetary union as Germany.","Nevertheless, I don't hesitate to say that elections in Germany are decided in the center, not on the fringes and not in the accumulation of minority interests.","You can't exactly bake a man to your specifications. Most of all, one shouldn't alienate a candidate. A hybrid of Einstein, Tarzan and Inge Meysel doesn't exist. Besides, the images of politicians in the media aren't always accurate. I've had my share of experiences in that regard.","But I would bet that the euro continues to exist and that its importance as a global currency will likely increase.","There's no more place in the euro zone for well-meaning laxness when dealing with deficits and failings. If the demands on Greece aren't taken seriously, we'll get stuck in quicksand. In the worst case, this would make it acceptable for one tranche to not be paid out. It is in the Greeks own interest not to test that.","Over a period of 20 years, German reunification has cost 2 trillion euros, or an average of 100 billion euros a year. So, we have to ask ourselves: Aren't we willing to pay a tenth of that over several years for Europe's unity?","You can't let a candidate run for too long. He will be dragged along, cut apart, put back together and ripped to shreds again - from both the political opponents and the media.","The U.S. will lose its status as the superpower of the world financial system. The world will become multi-polar.","If I had political responsibility, I would want to prepare for a plan B that would foresee that the European currency union, that the eurozone, no longer necessarily consists of 17 member states. And that means to make provisions so that other countries are not pulled into the maelstrom through contagion."],"Peggy Fleming":["I think exercise tests us in so many ways, our skills, our hearts, our ability to bounce back after setbacks. This is the inner beauty of sports and competition, and it can serve us all well as adult athletes.","Skating was the vessel into which I could pour my heart and soul.","My sport taught me what I could do with my talents, whether in the rink or in the rest of my life.","The first thing is to love your sport. Never do it to please someone else. It has to be yours.","As a young child, I played the violin. I think that that started the spark.","We wanted to be achievers, but being an achiever didn't mean that you stopped being a woman.","Giving life to music through skating was something I wanted to be known for.","I really loved what the guys were doing more than anything, how high they jumped, how effortless it was.","I think skating helped me find myself.","In 1968, in the midst of the tumultuous 1960s, the Olympics were much more than just another event.","The world went by, and we didn't get caught up in all the other things, because we didn't have time. We had no spare time. It was always thinking about training and focusing on what we wanted, our goals.","Then came the choreography... the impact of music and choreography tends to really emphasize an overall feeling of what you really want out of the program.","When I was on the ice, in the lights, with the music and the motion, there was a certain kind of flirtation that gave great energy and expressiveness to my performance.","When the going got tough, I really had to draw on many of the same competitive instincts I did when I was skating. I really had to put my head down and stay positive. I had to fight."],"Peggy Johnson":["I just feel like you should be able to have a respectful work environment, because if you do, you'll be your best self.","Wireless is the largest information, communication, and technology platform in history, and mobile broadband is transforming how we can deliver educational materials and experiences to all students. The technology now exists to support learning on a massive scale and advance the 21st century skills needed to compete in the global economy.","As more and more of our world becomes part of the wireless network, I see the mobile phone becoming a central command station for everything around us.","If a company has a navigation system or a database or a virtual assistant they like better, Microsoft will meet them in the middle.","You don't have to fit into a mold that someone else has defined.","It's up to you to define your own brand of leadership and your own version of success.","The opportunity to build new and surprising partnerships to help Microsoft succeed in a mobile-first, cloud-first world is truly exciting, and I look forward to leading these efforts.","When a culture is broken, the cracks show - morale is weakened, but so is profit and performance. That's why culture has to be at the core of any business transformation.","I think our Acompli acquisition was an interesting one, which started with a partnership and looking at their mobile e-mail app on iOS and Android. And what I would like to highlight with that one is the speed that we actually turned that around and brought it out the door.","Business development is a part of M&A - we identify signals in the market, whether its trends or disruptive technology, and bring them back and address the opportunities. I have three levers I can pull - partnerships, acquisitions, or investments.","Very early in my career, I thought I had to conform to one style of leadership - lead by being the loudest one in the room, with the sharpest elbows.","I can still hear my mom's voice echoing through the house, reminding me and my siblings to 'Make your beds!' It seems like such a small thing, but when you're one of 15 brothers and sisters like me, those small reminders about the importance of discipline and order are critical.","Deals are always a bit lumpy. We look at, 'Is it solving a problem for us?' And if it does, we move to acquisition.","When you dig in, two big titans clashing, what good is that? It's not good for either of us; it's not good for the industry.","Do one thing well, and then build from there.","In Indonesia, Qualcomm, in a joint project with Grameen Foundation, has provided a range of mobile phone-based services to individuals. This project facilitates the creation of businesses for those living at the bottom of the economic pyramid and, at the same time, extends telecommunication access to people who cannot afford a mobile phone.","A lot of companies have nice-sounding cultural values like integrity, respect, and excellence, but if those values don't map to specific behaviors, then they quickly get lost. Instead, we see what's called a 'halo effect' where leaders tend to overvalue certain attributes and undervalue others.","We try not to look at everything through a competitive lens.","I had to find my own terms for success, and it wasn't anything like what I was told to do.","Great things happen when you converge services and devices.","'Rather than fighting over a piece of the pie, can we grow the pie?' is really our model.","When text messaging first came out, you could only text within your network, whatever operator you had. It seems silly now, but once those walls came down, all sorts of applications and services were built on top of that. It ended up being good for everybody.","I'm an electrical engineer, and when I first started out, there was nobody who looked like me out there. I worked at Qualcomm, and I remember coming into meeting rooms, and I could never get the floor. I could never get my opinion across.","I spend a lot of time in the Valley. I'm probably down there every other week or so.","Cyanogen has done an interesting job with their version of Android - the Cyanogenmod. And they're on 50-million-plus devices. And that's just another ecosystem that we wanted to tap into and to bring our Office apps to.","We fully recognized that our customers have a variety of devices. They're carrying all sorts of things. And we want to bring our world-class apps to those devices.","Acompli is just a great example of a fabulous app.","I worked on anti-submarine warfare for surface ships.","Once I was able to be my more authentic self, I felt like that's when my career really took off. I was just my own voice.","My parents had two rules: You had to go to college, and you had to pay for it yourself. So we all did.","I grew up in a big, blended Irish Catholic family just outside of Los Angeles.","The 14th of 15 kids, I was the second youngest - not a coveted spot on the family totem pole.","I spent almost 25 years at Qualcomm before joining Microsoft, so in a sense, I grew up at one company. During that time, I made a very big shift from the engineering side to the business side.","At many companies, business development is treated as a sales tool for incremental growth, but I believe that business development can bend our growth curve in a big way. It should accelerate our ability to grow, helping us quickly close gaps or leap ahead of competitors.","M&A at Microsoft is a team sport for the senior leadership group. They're all involved in it, and we all play different roles. My role is the first centralized business development role at Microsoft.","Valuations are always much-debated. I try to center on what is the value to us. Is it solving a problems for us? If it is, we find a way to proceed. If the valuation has been overhyped on something and it doesn't make sense, we won't. It's very simple for me. I tend not to worry too much about the valuation. It's really what the value is to us.","Really, we don't look at deals as 'big' or 'small': we look at things that will solve a problem for us.","Women themselves are an emerging market.","We all have to think about the emerging markets.","It's not just about checking the box on corporate social responsibility. It's about hitting our bottom line.","There are more and more women entering into the workforce themselves. More and more of them are making more money.","To young professionals - and particularly women - looking to advance, it is imperative to keep your life in balance.","I attended a high school with more than 4,000 students and met with a guidance counselor only once during my four-year stint. Despite my clear strengths in science and math, my counselor's advice was to pursue a degree in business. A career in engineering was never encouraged nor, in fact, ever mentioned.","As a college freshman with an on-campus job, I was delivering paperwork to the engineering department one day. There, I encountered two department assistants whose faces lit up with the hope that I was a prospective student. I hadn't come there to enroll, but their reactions piqued my interest.","Qualcomm has seen firsthand the transformative power of mobile technology as part of many projects created through its Wireless Reach initiative - programs around the world that help educators, health care workers, and entrepreneurs take advantage of mobile technology.","Wireless technology is creating entrepreneurship on a small scale that allows a single woman to set up a business in a small village or a single farmer or fisherman to access and disseminate market information in order to get the best price for their products.","More and more of the world's population is gaining access to the same kind of computing power and connectivity that has transformed daily life for developed nations.","As our smartphone becomes even smarter, mobile technology should actually take the burden out of our daily lives.","I envision a world where our smartphone is central to our lives in a non-obtrusive and intelligent way.","Our smartphones can offer innovative opportunities for improving how we react to our environment, and I believe it is increasingly becoming an asset - not a hindrance - to maintaining a healthier relationship with our work, our friends, and the world around us.","Access to the Internet is an essential tool for equipping students with 21st century skills.","As the world continues its love affair with smartphones and tablets, mobile has become so essential to our lives that most people couldn't imagine life without it.","The proliferation of mobile broadband networks combined with local area hot spots is bringing the dream of seamless and ubiquitous connectivity closer to reality.","Over the course of my career as an engineer-turned-tech evangelist, I've had the privilege of travelling the world and seeing the extraordinary impact of mobile on people and communities across a broad range of cultures and socio-economic strata. In many ways, mobile is a democratizing force. It empowers us. It inspires us. It extends our reach.","Apparently, my grandfather left from Cork to America without saying goodbye to his mother! The family in Longford is still not happy about that.","Culture used to be viewed as the 'touchy-feely' side of business, but that's no longer the case. If you don't have a defined culture behind you, then you aren't going to be effective at executing your strategy.","A culture that only recognizes and rewards the same set of attributes results in less collaboration, creativity, and innovation. If we only reward the loudest voices or the sharpest elbows, then we're missing out on the full range of talent.","At Microsoft, we know first-hand how passionate entrepreneurs can change the world. We believe that technology can empower everyone to achieve more.","It's a balance - sometimes you have to concentrate on your home life, and sometimes you have to concentrate on your work life.","We want to ensure that as a user is moving through their world, their data is following them in an appropriate manner.","We look for partners who are solving a problem for us. If they've already solved it, we'd much rather try to partner with them than try to rebuild it.","The industry trend is that everything is moving to the cloud, and most of our customers are in this very heterogeneous world.","Gaming provides us with some very good signals about consumers and what they're interested in.","Microsoft is a much bigger company than Qualcomm - a much bigger company - and there were a few days where I thought, 'I don't know if I can do this. It's huge.' My job was to come into the company and grow new businesses, and I thought, 'I'm not sure,' but it's all worked out pretty well.","I would try to be super-assertive in meetings and, you know, pound my hand off the table, and it never ended well. People would say, 'What are you beating the table for?' It's not natural for me.","I focus a fair amount of my time on ensuring that we have a good funnel of females coming into the company and then that we're retaining that as well and making sure that we have comfortable environments for them to be successful in.","If some day you're struggling with math, and you think, 'I don't think I can do this,' you can - you actually can. Everybody has their hard days - I definitely had mine - and you get through them, and you learn from that stumble, and then you're onto the next problem.","If an acquisition can speed a process or fill a gap, we'll jump right to that. It's about timing, need... it's not necessarily an algorithm.","We are constantly scanning for opportunities.","We have such a huge demand for engineers in this country, both male and female. We need to find a way to do a better sales job on these young girls so we can get them interested in a field that is very rewarding.","I think there really needs to be a culture change because young girls are very interested in math and science, but somewhere along the way, they veer off of that.","You're sitting in the car for many, many minutes a day. Can that be part of your new office? Can it be your new desk, a place where you actually get work done? We believe it can.","Live Nation is one of the most unique, exciting companies in the world and has remained at the forefront of the live entertainment industry by continuing to innovate and bring live entertainment to more fans around the globe.","Together with Adobe, we're committed to fostering creativity and a culture of teamwork for our shared customers so they can unlock the opportunities of today's rapidly evolving workplace.","We're thrilled that our partnership with Adobe has now grown to span our three clouds - Microsoft Azure, Office 365, and Dynamics 365 - providing customers with the powerful integrations they need to navigate digital transformation."],"Peggy Lee":["Retire? Not on your life. I have no plans to stop singing. What are you going to do when you love music? It's a terrible disease. You can't stop. Of course, I'd like to get off the road.","I really don't have that many run-ins. People by and large are very nice to me.","You can't beat The Beatles, you join 'em.","I'm always happy when I'm cleaning, and besides, I had just found out that I was going to have a baby."],"Peggy Lipton":["I didn't know how to smile for the paparazzi.","No one knows me with dark hair.","Beauty at any age really does come from within.","I feel the same magic about 'Angel Falls' that I did with 'Twin Peaks' and 'Mod Squad.'","In acting class, I used to hide in the corner and pray the teacher wouldn't call on me.","I ran into Neal Patrick Harris recently. We were in something called The Purple People Eater. He was maybe 10, but he still remembered it as the worst experience of his life!","Despite 'Mod Squad's hit status, I never really made the inner connection that I was contributing.","I know I wanted to be with somebody and have children. My heart comes before my work.","I'm kind of kooky, but do I look like a religious nut?","I had a wall around me and a lot of fantasy locked inside.","I didn't stutter when I was reading lines in a script. When I got away from myself, I didn't have that problem.","Sometimes I would make myself very still and try to imagine myself dead. I tried to invoke the feeling of the very last breath I would take.","My love affairs were more often about the fantasy than the actual person I was involved with.","I love pool because it's a game of strategy, a game of the eye, and your whole universe is like this. I really want to become a pool shark.","I used to worry I'd make a fool of myself, but I don't care what anyone thinks of me anymore.","I never had confidence - never. The hardest thing to know is your own worth, and it took me years and years to find out what mine is.","I didn't come from a background where I was hurt, but I felt hurt inside.","I was very guarded.","If you look at the old 'Mod Squad's, there was a lot of space in between our dialogue.","My daughters made me stop wearing sweats to run errands.","I hated Long Island, and I had to get out.","I've been in some terrible movies.","I want to do 'The Graduate!' When Lorraine Bracco's finished, I'm up for it.","I live in Juicy Couture sweats and a pair of Uggs.","I feel more content with what I wear. I always feel confident. I shop for my age and my body.","I advise my daughters to moisturize, moisturize, moisturize, but worrying too much about the way you look will age you.","My heart goes out to Lindsay Lohan.","I was trying to heal wounds all the time, whether it meant having affairs or having attitude. I didn't want to show how sad I was.","I was very insecure about my looks.","I had become so insulated in my world as a mother that I didn't know how to pick up the phone and call anybody to put myself out there. I don't live my life anymore that way.","I never saw myself as trend-setting.","Fame really drove me into my house. I was very paranoid. I didn't like going out. I had no idea how to be comfortable with the press. I was very young. It was really hard for me."],"Peggy Noonan":["Part of courage is simple consistency.","The battle for the mind of Ronald Reagan was like the trench warfare of World War I: never have so many fought so hard for such barren terrain.","Speeches are not magic and there is no great speech without great policy.","If you join government, calmly make your contribution and move on. Don't go along to get along; do your best and when you have to - and you will - leave, and be something else.","All great political families have myths: stories they tell themselves about how history happened.","Candor is a compliment; it implies equality. It's how true friends talk.","Sincerity and competence is a strong combination. In politics, it is everything.","Beware the politically obsessed. They are often bright and interesting, but they have something missing in their natures; there is a hole, an empty place, and they use politics to fill it up. It leaves them somehow misshapen.","My generation, faced as it grew with a choice between religious belief and existential despair, chose marijuana. Now we are in our Cabernet stage.","The 2008 election settled nothing, not even for a while. Our national politics are reflecting what appears to be going on geologically, on the bottom of the oceans and beneath the crust of the Earth: the tectonic plates are moving.","Memo to future presidents: Never stake your entire survival on the painful passing of a bad bill. Never take the country down the road to 'Demon Pass.'","I think miracles exist in part as gifts and in part as clues that there is something beyond the flat world we see.","You don't have to be old in America to say of a world you lived in: That world is gone.","If you commit a big crime then you are crazy, and the more heinous the crime the crazier you must be. Therefore you are not responsible, and nothing is your fault.","I love eulogies. They are the most moving kind of speech because they attempt to pluck meaning from the fog, and on short order, when the emotions are still ragged and raw and susceptible to leaps.","Let's cause some senators distress.","Abortion is either OK or it's not.","A great speech is literature.","TV gives everyone an image, but radio gives birth to a million images in a million brains.","Don't fall in love with politicians, they're all a disappointment. They can't help it, they just are.","I ought to pray as much as God's on my mind, because then I'd pray a lot. All I can tell you is God is real, and so that infuses everything.","The president - every president - works for us. We don't work for him. We sometimes lose track of this, or rather get the balance wrong. Respect is due and must be palpable, but now and then you have to press, to either force them to be forthcoming or force them to reveal that they won't be.","Presidents have a right to certain prerogatives, including the expectation of a certain deference. He's the president; this is history. But we seem to have come a long way since Ronald Reagan was regularly barked at by Sam Donaldson, almost literally, and the president shrugged it off.","There is nothing wrong with being a declared liberal or conservative and conducting a sympathetic interview with a political figure who shares your views.","You don't tell people who disagree with you they'd be better off somewhere else. And you don't reduce them to stereotypes; you address them as fully formed people worthy of respect. You try to persuade them.","Democracy involves that old-fashioned thing called working it out.","What Andrew Cuomo said is, truly, a scandal. It's a scandal if he actually thinks it - that those who hold conservative views on abortion, gun rights and marriage are extreme, anathema and have no place in the state."],"Peggy Rathmann":["When a kid graduates from being the youngest in a family to being a big brother or sister, there's an amazing transformation. They have to make a big effort, and when they accept their new position in the family, everybody breathes a sigh of relief. All of a sudden they seem bigger, and they seem smarter, and they feel good about it, too.","When you look at children, they're so beautiful, and they seem so peaceful because their faces aren't all wrinkly and worried. They're like beautiful little pieces of pottery or something. You want to think they have this peace because they have no big responsibilities, but it's just not true.","Opening myself to criticism was a big door to go through. You can be afraid about something your whole life, about being out in public where people know your name but not you, and it can cripple your ability to try new things.","It's really an interesting problem, trying to earn a living and serve art and serve kids. What I try to create are these visual layers so that readers feel the possibility exists that there might be something in the book they never saw before.","I lived at home off and on until I was 37. I have about a million college credits. I'd worry about writing about anyone else because I'd be invading their privacy, but you can use your mom and dad and their dog for everything!","When you make illustrations, you're supposed to have a subtext; you're not just communicating words - you're actually adding another story altogether."],"Pele":["Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do.","Enthusiasm is everything. It must be taut and vibrating like a guitar string.","A lot of people, when a guy scores a lot of goals, think, 'He's a great player', because a goal is very important, but a great player is a player who can do everything on the field. He can do assists, encourage his colleagues, give them confidence to go forward. It is someone who, when a team does not do well, becomes one of the leaders.","Brazil eats, sleeps and drinks football. It lives football!","Everything is practice.","The first World Cup I remember was in the 1950 when I was 9 or 10 years old. My father was a soccer player, and there was a big party, and when Brazil lost to Uruguay, I saw my father crying.","The World Cup is a very important way to measure the good players, and the great ones. It is a test of a great player.","The World Cup is a very complicated tournament - six games, seven if you make it to the final - and maybe if you lose one game you're out, even if you're the best.","I am constantly being asked about individuals. The only way to win is as a team. Football is not about one or two or three star players.","I always had a philosophy which I got from my father. He used to say, 'Listen. God gave to you the gift to play football. This is your gift from God. If you take care of your health, if you are in good shape all the time, with your gift from God no one will stop you, but you must be prepared.'","If I pass away one day, I am happy because I tried to do my best. My sport allowed me to do so much because it's the biggest sport in the world.","Wherever you go, there are three icons that everyone knows: Jesus Christ, Pele and Coca-Cola.","If you don't give education to people, it is easy to manipulate them.","Pele doesn't die. Pele will never die. Pele is going to go on for ever.","Everything on earth is a game. A passing thing. We all end up dead. We all end up the same, don't we?","You must respect people and work hard to be in shape. And I used to train very hard. When the others players went to the beach after training, I was there kicking the ball.","Over the years I've learnt to live with two persons in my heart. One is Edson, who has fun with his friends and family; the other is the football player Pele. I didn't want the name. 'Pele' sounds like baby-talk in Portuguese.","When you play against dirty players or very tough players, it's easy to escape because you know what they're going to do. But when the player is tough but intelligent, it's much more difficult.","I represent Brazil all over the world. Wherever I go I have to do my best, to not disappoint the Brazilian people. And that I've done.","The bicycle kick is not easy to do. I scored 1,283 goals, and only two or three were bicycle kicks.","Sport is something that is very inspirational for young people.","All my life I thank God. My family was very religious.","To be a striker you need to be in good shape.","When you are young, you do a lot of stupid things.","Lionel Messi is a wonderful player. Very skillful. Highly intelligent. He is not good in the air.","The level of football in England is the top. English football is the leader in the world.","No doubt, I am earning more money with my endorsements than I ever earned playing soccer.","I always think that I would have become an actor if I hadn't been a soccer player.","The bicycle kick is not easy to do.","I played for Santos at 16, and we had an excellent team, so it helped a lot. And then I played for Brazil at the Maracana against Argentina. So I get more experience. This was one year before the World Cup, and it made a lot of difference.","I have to trust something that gives me power; I have to believe in something, but in my career I have a lot of moments I cannot explain with God.","Yes, I have a lot of business interests. But I don't work for just anyone, and I choose the companies very carefully.","At 17, I already had responsibility because I took care of my family, but in the football I was young; I wasn't experienced or the captain - I was just in the team.","When I retired, at that time I had a lot of proposals to play in Europe, England, Italy, Spain, Mexico. But I said no, after 18 years I want to rest, because I want to retire.","A penalty is a cowardly way to score.","Everybody knows my life. I won a lot of tournaments and scored more than 1,000 goals, won three World Cups but I could not play in Olympic Games.","I was really proud that I was named after Thomas Edison and wanted to be called Edson. I thought Pele sounded horrible. It was a rubbish name. Edson sounded so much more serious and important.","Edson is the person that supports Pele. Edson is the base. Pele just comes and adds the face.","In 1962, my injury wasn't because of violence; I just kicked the ball and it happened. And that was OK because Brazil won; I didn't have any difficulty in accepting that. I still got a medal because I'd played two games.","When I was minister of sport in Brazil, I tried to bring in a law that would make the chairmen of clubs reveal their accounts like other businesses. It was turned down, but I think it is an important story that will make a good film.","I don't think I'm a very good businessman. I act too much with my heart.","I've come to accept that the life of a frontrunner is a hard one, that he will suffer more injuries than most men and that many of these injuries will not be accidental.","When I was a footballer, I surrounded myself with footballers. We were all friends. But in Brasilia you don't know who your friends are. It can be a dangerous place.","Of course, my father was a soccer player. He used to play very good. Then, when I was young, eight or nine years old, ten years old, I just want to be like my father.","I sometimes lie awake at night and wonder why I am still so popular and, to be honest, I don't know.","Brazil's always had great players, both at home and abroad, but we need to put all that talent together and mould a team out of it."],"Peleg Top":["Most designers and creative agencies, no matter their industry niche, will do some nonprofit or cause-related work at some stage of their career. This work helps us create a sense of purpose that is bigger than us. It connects us to our community, helps us leave a legacy and be part of something bigger than our own work.","Just as you can identify eras of fashion by glancing at a piece of vintage clothing, logos create and follow trends over time.","I like poems that inspire, that make us think and reflect. It's like putting love into the world for whoever picks it up.","I've been surprised to learn how many people love poetry. It's beautiful to see that people want poetry in their lives.","We live in such a digital age. Paper is going out of our lives. A poem on paper is tangible."],"Pema Chodron":["I equate ego with trying to figure everything out instead of going with the flow. That closes your heart and your mind to the person or situation that's right in front of you, and you miss so much.","The Buddha taught that we're not actually in control, which is a pretty scary idea. But when you let things be as they are, you will be a much happier, more balanced, compassionate person.","If right now our emotional reaction to seeing a certain person or hearing certain news is to fly into a rage or to get despondent or something equally extreme, it's because we have been cultivating that particular habit for a very long time.","Rejoicing in the good fortune of others is a practice that can help us when we feel emotionally shut down and unable to connect with others. Rejoicing generates good will.","As Buddhism moved from one culture to another, it always adapted.","As Buddhism moved to the West, one of the big characteristics was the strong place of women. That didn't exist in the countries of origin. It's just a sign of our culture.","According to the Buddhist belief, you can go on and on indefinitely, so you see your life as just a brief moment in time.","Sometimes people's spiritual ideas become fixed and they use them against those who don't share their beliefs - in effect, becoming fundamentalist. It's very dangerous - the finger of righteous indignation pointing at someone who is identified as bad or wrong.","There's something delicious about finding fault with something. And that can be including finding fault with one's self, you know?"],"Penelope Ann Miller":["If there's something decent going in television, the mediums now are kind of equal. Television has become much higher quality.","I look to longevity. I just consider myself an actress and getting good roles. If being a 'superstar' gets me good roles, then that's a positive thing. But my goal isn't just to be a superstar. It's to act for a long time.","The whole point is to hook people and keep them interested.","Luckily because I had a family and children, my priorities changed. I mean, I'm very passionate about my work but I have other interests and other things that balance my life.","Now with tabloids and seeing people walking around in sweats pumping gas you're like, 'Okay, they're just like us.'","Now I'm the go-to-girl for silent films.","I had a family, I had children, I got married. My ambition changed.","Harvey Weinstein bought our film, and he's an animal. He's got us out there campaigning and everything because honestly it's a silent black-and-white film.","The thing is, you don't want to overact or be full of yourself.","I did not get Botox because you wouldn't see any expression in my face. Hopefully it has paid off.","I don't want to work all of the time.","The film business has changed so dramatically from when I started.","There are great characters on television.","I'm just looking for a kind of project that will have a decent role and is something that I'll really enjoy doing. There are a lot more opportunities in television."],"Penelope Cruz":["All those cliches, those things you hear about having a baby and motherhood - all of them are true. And all of them are the most beautiful things you will ever experience.","Awards are great, as you get to meet up with friends and colleagues from your industry - a sort of reunion.","You cannot live your life looking at yourself from someone else's point of view.","I don't know if I believe in marriage. I believe in family, love and children.","As an actress, I really love people like Anna Magnani and Debra Winger. I also think there is nobody better than Meryl Streep.","The discipline that ballet requires is obsessive. And only the ones who dedicate their whole lives are able to make it. Your toenails fall off and you peel them away and then you're asked to dance again and keep smiling. I wanted to become a professional ballet dancer.","I am amazed about how everyone wants to know about my love life. They whisper to me, 'Tell me the truth? Is it true?' Who cares? Because we have this job, we are to say to everybody what we do, or with whom we sleep? It's a bit absurd, but that's why everybody lies so much.","I don't know why, but women in a hair salon share their deepest secrets.","I'm strong and opinionated. Those qualities brought me a lot of problems since I was a little girl in school, saying 'I don't agree' and fighting with the children. It's part of my curiosity for life.","The most important lesson I've learned in this business is how to say no. I have said no to a lot of temptations, and I am glad I did.","My ambition is to be happy.","I try to eat healthily, but I love fried food and bad things. Give me a plate of bread, some oil and salt and I'm happy. But you can't eat like this all the time.","When I start a movie, the first day, I feel like a duck.","I have a little bit of an addiction to work. So I'm always hiding in the bathroom with my Blackberry to work when I'm on holiday.","I want my son - and my kids, if I have more - to grow up in a way that is as anonymous as possible. The fact that his father and I have chosen to do the work that we do doesn't give anybody the right to invade our privacy.","I really like the Caribbean. Anyplace in the Caribbean. I get there, and I feel like a monkey - the perfect state.","Unfortunately, I am very aware of editing and I look at the monitor too much. Sometimes the monitor can become your worst enemy because you can, consciously or unconsciously, start editing yourself.","I have stepped off the relationship scene to come to terms with myself. I have spent most of my adult life being 'someone's girlfriend', and now I am happy being single.","Even if you were aware of children and felt compassion, when you have your own, it multiplies. It breaks your heart to know that there are so many children in the world suffering so much.","In my everyday life, I just wear jeans, t-shirts and trainers - if I can go barefoot, that's even better. But for the events I have a stylist, and in two hours we have selected a whole outfit.","I've worked myself to exhaustion before. I was so young, and I thought I could do everything; it was just too much for my body and my mind.","I just try not to label myself in any way. I just have an allergy to labels in general. I can tell you that I am surrounded by very strong women and that I really appreciate that, but I'd rather not label myself.","In my house every Sunday, everybody was cleaning the house. There was always music, and everybody was dancing, sometimes naked, around the house. Not hippie, but very free.","I have been hearing gossip and lies since I began working. When I was 17, I used to get very angry because I opened a magazine and I saw myself in a picture on a motorcycle, and the headline was, 'I'm getting married next month.'","I breastfed my son for 13 months, and I plan to do at least the same with my daughter. That's an amazing thing for babies, but it's also really good for the mother because it regulates your body again after pregnancy.","I hope that I will be able to work all of my life - even when I am older. It's easier to do that in Europe than in America, because in America it is difficult for older actresses to find work.","I came to Los Angeles for the first time in 1994. I spoke no English. I only knew how to say two sentences: 'How are you?' and 'I want to work with Johnny Depp.'","I have a strong personality, and I say what I think.","There are roles I have said no to, but for different reasons. And, I never talk about those because I feel it's disrespectful to say, 'Oh, I said no to this project or that other project.' I'd rather talk about the ones that I said yes to and the reasons why.","Johnny Depp is so special that he is like a Martian. In fact, that's what I call him, Martian.","The most difficult thing in the world is to start a career known only for your looks, and then to try to become a serious actress. No one will take you seriously once you are known as the pretty woman.","I like roles that people don't recognize me in.","I want to have babies one day but not right now. When I do it I want to do it really well. I want it to be my best project in life.","There's so much more I want to do. I refuse to get to 50 and wait at home for the phone to ring.","I want to be remembered as somebody that tried to respect her integrity as an artist and as a person. And I don't want to be in any box. I don't want to be one thing.","In Spain, actresses work until they are old. That's my plan.","I love New York, but being there the whole year, it gets a little crazy with the speed and rhythm of things.","I remember when I got my first opportunity to work in America, I didn't speak a lot of English, so I only really knew my lines for the movie I was doing.","I came to New York to study ballet and English.","Maybe I'll make one movie a year, maybe two, but it's not going to be more than that because I have other priorities now.","I am living for every day and trying to have less fear, less worry. But I have always worried about everything; it's in my nature. It's the thing that makes me suffer the most.","One thing that I am proud of: I am really capable of laughing at myself.","There's so much more I want to do. I refuse to get to 50 and wait at home for the phone to ring. In Spain, actresses work until they are old. That's my plan.","I love the Italian culture - it's a beautiful culture. I love the language, the Italian people, their music, their attitudes... I just love it! Sometimes I think I'm an Italian trapped in a Spanish woman's body.","I remember playing with some friends and being aware that I was acting as I was playing with them - I would think of a character and pretend to be someone else.","I try to look at the whole thing and say 'yes' to the projects that I cannot stop thinking about. If I read a script and the subject stays with me - then that's when I want to go to work.","I learned English kind of late. I remember when I got my first opportunity to work in America, I didn't speak a lot of English, so I only really knew my lines for the movie I was doing.","I won't go to places where you're going to find more attention. I go to the opposite.","I only drive in movies. I know that's very weird to hear for an American. I have a weird relationship with it. I know how to drive, but I never went to take the test.","Especially when you are advertising a product, I talk to the photographer and we create a character - it always gives you more freedom because it makes it less about yourself.","I am a big fan of photography, more of being behind the camera - so when I get the opportunity to work with such great photographers, I always try and learn from their technique.","It's great working with my sister, because we are very close as a family - my brother, my sister and myself. We have a great relationship.","There are so many designers that I love, and I'm so lucky that I get to work with so many of them and sometimes spend time with them.","When I read a script, I try not to judge the characters. I try to have an open mind and really see what it makes me feel.","For 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona,' for example, Woody Allen is one of the greatest American directors, and we really had a very good working relationship. We understand each other really well. He gave me one of the best opportunities somebody has ever given me in my career.","I can cook a little bit. I can cook a few Spanish dishes. But, in movies, it looks like I cook much better than I cook.","I am someone who worries a lot. I'm always worrying 'what if?' Now I'm a mum - there will be worries for the rest of my life, but they're not about me anymore.","I used to dance for seventeen years -classical ballet, which was very disciplined. I like yoga and Pilates, but I don't have the discipline to go to the gym.","When I was 16, I got 'Jamon, Jamon.' Of course, I had to lie about my age. And I had to lie to my parents about the content of the script.","There is a part of your brain that has to stop when you're acting. You have to be in the moment and dare to fly. Words can't be on your mind.","I don't play comedy as comedy. That would be the biggest trap. I think about the characters and their situations. Then you don't have to worry where the laugh is going to be. But comedy is harder than drama.","When I was 16 or 17, when I started, I never even considered not doing a project. I just wanted to work.","As a kid, I had a lot of energy; but the ballet lessons made me calm - this pleased my mother.","Ever since I was a little girl, I've worried too much. It always bothers me because sometimes you end up worrying more about the worry and you are not resolving things that are right there in front of you. I have been like that all my life, and it's hard to change.","I have had a very singular kind of life since I started working so young, so I am very used to traveling, working, taking time for myself.","I always feel scared and insecure on a film set. I don't know any other way.","Sometimes you will do a close-up for a scene in the morning where you are totally distraught, then shoot the rest of that scene seven hours later. How do you hang on to that feeling all day without burning up, without going so far that you have nothing left to give when the cameras roll again?","I was 11 when I first said I wanted to become an actress, and everyone looked at me as if I had said I wanted to go to the moon.","I was very superstitious when I was a teenager, and I had to fight against that because it made me feel anxious.","My first fear was about the devil, when I was around fire, something I saw in a movie. I think it's about pain, in whichever form it comes.","You can always keep learning with acting, because the school is life and yourself and your friends and your relationships. I'm fascinated by it! It's infinito!","Calcutta is like another world. People there are very special and grateful.","I love Salma Hayek; we've been friends for a really long time. I admire how she has come such a long way and always remained grounded and who she is. She never compromises to follow her vision, and she is loyal. Such qualities only mark the great stars.","I remember playing with some friends and being aware that I was acting as I was playing with them - I would think of a character and pretend to be someone else. My parents also took me to ballet school, and there I think I was able to start communicating those feelings or emotions - I danced for so many years.","It doesn't happen every day, but many nights my dreams are like a movie. I don't see normal movement - I see things in very complicated shots. That's why I do remember many of them.","Making a living out of acting sounded like science-fiction when I was growing up. I didn't know anyone around me who lived from anything related to art.","There are so many designers that I love, and I'm so lucky that I get to work with so many of them and sometimes spend time with them. As an actress, you get to go to these events and wear their things - it's fun, but it is what it is. I don't put a lot of time into it, but I respect what they do.","There's a lot of work that goes into it - if you think about how many collections a year that Karl Lagerfeld has to do, with Chanel and all the other things he does - you can't do that unless you are working 18 hours a day. It's really a lot of hard, hard work.","I am not somebody who likes to give advice, or anything like that, unless it's my closest friends or family.","Madrid is what I call home, but also the States.","In 'Twice Born' I play my character in her 20s, 30s and 50s. For the fifty year old scenes, I had some prosthetics; it was interesting to see how I'm going to look when I'm fifty-five or so. I actually saw similarities between my grandmothers and my mother.","I really dislike it when the media asks young actresses, normally when they're about 23, how they feel about ageing. There are other things to worry about.","I always knew I wanted a family because of the way I grew up. Family has always been the most important thing.","My parents owned a hair salon, so I learned a few tricks there. I can cut people's hair - if they let me.","I don't do Twitter, Facebook; none of that. My email I do from my Blackberry or my iPhone.","I try to do as much as possible for every character. Some of them, it is easier to do the research because you have either real examples that you work with, maybe some specific person that inspires you in that case, or the performances from other people, or the characters, or a character from a book.","The thing that really makes me happy is the real work and rehearsing and creating the character and the process of making the movie. Hollywood's not real.","My first fear was about the devil, when I was around fire, something I saw in a movie. I think it's about pain, in whichever form it comes. I had a lot of energy as a child - sometimes too much - and I didn't know how to channel it. It was making me suffer. It was bigger than myself, and I was very young.","My favourite actress is Meryl Streep. Oh, and Anna Magnani.","I have fear, always, on the set. Insecurity to the point where the first week I always think I could be fired. I think that's a fear most actors have.","I never felt, 'Oh, I think I look good.' I always tend to be more in the insecure side. And I thought that has always been a way to protect myself. Because I don't trust the good feelings that can come from that.","There was a point where I was making four movies a year. I was always on a set. I had no stories to tell. I was feeling empty. My life was just luggage and hotels and from set to set, from character to character. And one day, I said, 'And where is mine?' You know? And the moment I started to feel that fear, I stopped and I slowed down.","I love Spanish food. My diet is the Mediterranean diet, which is good food. I eat well.","I love ballet, and it's a little boring for me to go to the gym because I'm used to the dancing discipline - it's really hard but much more fun.","I had a very curly perm in the '80s, thanks to the 'Way You Make Me Feel' Michael Jackson video. I liked the girl in it.","I never want to lie about my age. If I look around at the actresses I admire, they are all women who have not fought growing older, but embraced it and been proud of it - women like Sophia Loren or Audrey Hepburn.","I was raised Catholic, but then I discovered Buddhism, and I used to have a boyfriend who was a Scientologist, and they are all good religions that help people. As far as I'm concerned, you can have all three religions at once and it's okay!","It's a good thing to be old. Because when you get older, that means you haven't died yet, right? And when I do get older, I want to have the grace to be proud of it, not to lie about it or try to fight it."],"Penelope Fitzgerald":["However, no two people see the external world in exactly the same way. To every separate person a thing is what he thinks it is - in other words, not a thing, but a think.","If they don't depend on true evidence, scientists are no better than gossips."],"Penelope Keith":["Shyness is just egoism out of its depth.","I don't feel 'vibes' when I enter a building - don't feel the previous owners looking down on me. But I do know when a place feels friendly.","Everyone wants instant everything, and they want instant success, but I always think you should treat things in the arts like a garden, and let them grow.","We always had chocolates and my mother was careful to make sure they were unwrapped in advance so the paper wouldn't rustle in the middle of a performance.","The character I play in Star Quality says acting is the be-all and end-all of her life. I'm not like that. I do enjoy working and I give every job my best shot but I never feel, What on Earth am I going to do now?","I think I'm a better actress for having friends and interests outside the theatre. I wouldn't want to live my life surrounded by other actors all the time.","I plant a lot of trees. I am a great believer in planting things for future generations. I loathe the now culture where you just live for today.","Young people don't want to sit at home and watch television; they'd sooner be out doing their own thing.","In my book, all manners are is thinking of somebody else.","In this great age of communication, there a lot of people you can't actually understand. I know everyone tweets, and twits and texts and all that, but actually we've all got voices, and it is awfully nice to hear them and if you can understand what people are saying.","I love touring, I really do.","I don't think actors ever retire, they just stop being asked to work.","So often actors only mix with actors, which is quite incestuous, and doesn't give them the insight into how other people work.","With a play, you do it and it's gone. Films always date. Television drama always dates. Television comedy, for some reason, seems to go on.","I'm a bit of a Scotophile. I have a house on the Black Isle, so I'm in Scotland quite a lot and think Edinburgh is just the most beautiful city.","I always used to say when I was on television that I prefer to be on stage and when on stage I prefer to do television. Typical human condition.","I'm sure that is a reason why young people occasionally bash up old people - because the ages don't mix any more.","I think it is very sad that 'sitcom' has become a pejorative term.","Older people, who just happen to have been around longer, may not be cleverer than the young, but they have seen more.","A lot of people have it - that fantasy of being lord or lady of the manor, either in the present or at some time in history.","I'm a realist.","Language is my bugbear. Everyone says things now like 'I was sat' instead of 'I was sitting', which just sounds so ugly.","I'm not against accents - my husband's from Lancashire and has a rural Lancs accent. We've just got back from Scotland yesterday, and I love that Highland burr.","I don't believe in public humiliation. It went out with the stocks.","We have this wonderful language and we don't appreciate it. That's old-fashioned me, but when I went to school, everyone had elocution lessons, not to sound posh but so you could be understood."],"Penelope Leach":["Loving a baby is a circular business, a kind of feedback loop. The more you give the more you get and the more you get the more you feel like giving.","For a small child there is no division between playing and learning; between the things he or she does just for fun and things that are educational. The child learns while living and any part of living that is enjoyable is also play."],"Penelope Lively":["I'm intrigued by the way in which physical appearance can often direct a person's life; things happen differently for a beautiful woman than for a plain one.","All I know for certain is that reading is of the most intense importance to me; if I were not able to read, to revisit old favorites and experiment with names new to me, I would be starved - probably too starved to go on writing myself.","The pleasure of writing fiction is that you are always spotting some new approach, an alternative way of telling a story and manipulating characters; the novel is such a wonderfully flexible form.","It seems to me that everything that happens to us is a disconcerting mix of choice and contingency.","I'm now an agnostic but I grew up on the King James version, which I'm eternally grateful for.","Deep down I have this atavistic feeling that really I should be in the country.","The consideration of change over the century is about loss, though I think that social change is gain rather than loss.","I'm not an historian but I can get interested - obsessively interested - with any aspect of the past, whether it's palaeontology or archaeology or the very recent past.","There's a preoccupation with memory and the operation of memory and a rather rapacious interest in history.","I didn't write anything until I was well over 30.","It was a combination of an intense interest in children's literature, which I've always had, and the feeling that I'd just have a go and see if I could do it.","I didn't think I had anything particular to say, but I thought I might have something to say to children.","We read Greek and Norse mythology until it came out of our ears. And the Bible.","I can walk about London and see a society that seems an absolutely revolutionary change from the 1950s, that seems completely and utterly different, and then I can pick up on something where you suddenly see that it's not.","I'm not an historian and I'm not wanting to write about how I perceive the social change over the century as a historian, but as somebody who's walked through it and whose life has been dictated by it too, as all our lives are.","I didn't want it to be a book that made pronouncements.","I'm writing another novel and I know what I'm going to do after, which may be something more like this again, maybe some strange mixture of fiction and non-fiction.","I rather like getting away from fiction.","I have had to empty two family homes during the last few years - first, the house that had been my grandmother's since 1923, and then my own country home, which we had lived in for over twenty years.","I've always been fascinated by the operation of memory - the way in which it is not linear but fragmented, and its ambivalence.","The Photograph is concerned with the power that the past has to interfere with the present: the time bomb in the cupboard.","We make choices but are constantly foiled by happenstance.","I have long been interested in landscape history, and when younger and more robust I used to do much tramping of the English landscape in search of ancient field systems, drove roads, indications of prehistoric settlement.","I do like to embed a fictional character firmly in an occupation.","You learn a lot, writing fiction.","Every novel generates its own climate, when you get going.","Conventional forms of narrative allow for different points of view, but for this book I wanted a structure whereby each of the main characters contributed a distinctive version of the story.","We all need a past - that's where our sense of identity comes from.","Getting to know someone else involves curiosity about where they have come from, who they are.","Equally, we require a collective past - hence the endless reinterpretations of history, frequently to suit the perceptions of the present.","The present hardly exists, after all-it becomes the past even as it happens. A tricky medium, time - and central to the concerns of fiction.","Since then, I have just read and read - but, that said, I suppose there is a raft of writers to whom I return again and again, not so much because I want to write like them, even if I were capable of it, but simply for a sort of stylistic shot in the arm."],"Penelope Mitchell":["At the end of my first year, I realized I wanted to do more drama, so I actually started an extracurricular course outside of university. So I was at school all day writing, and in the evenings I'd go to drama school. So it was nonstop.","My first year of university, I ran around and signed up for these clubs, and I noticed they were all drama clubs: really lame, artsy things.","I remember being this little girl missing her daddy and living so far away in France and from anything that was familiar to me. I felt so different and so isolated. When you're removed from everything that's familiar, you realize who you are.","Even though I was manically overachieving and involved in everything, I still never felt like I belonged. That's definitely affected my whole life and why I wanted to become an actor and tell people stories, because communication and feeling like you belong is such an integral part of our social fabric.","T.S. Eliot was one of the first poets introduced to me when I started studying literature and has felt like a close friend ever since. No one nails urban despair quite like Eliot.","I think that film combines almost every element that makes human life worth living.","Ever since I can remember, I've worn big black boots. They are super warm and get me where I need to go.","Melbourne, where I grew up, is one of the street art capitals of the world. Something about discovering freshly painted walls always fills me with optimism; it's autonomous and democratic, and reminds me that maybe people are paying attention after all."],"Penelope Spheeris":["When men have money and power they get turned on, sexually. They get horny as hell. Can't imagine why, though.","Arnold and Jamie Lee must have worked over the years with directors that did 50 takes, because I'd get like three takes or so and say, Ok, that's it, we're done.","Before you approach a production entity or even a potential producer, you should write up a treatment and register your show with the Writers Guild of America.","Big studio comedies are such a headache.","Decline III, I funded myself, from the studio money. That, and I sold a lot of drugs. Kidding. Don't print that.","Different parents have different standards for their children.","For the most part, studio movies have huge budgets. They don't do anything under 30 to 40 million. When you have that much money at stake, you have so many people breathing down your neck.","I actually picked up copies of Decline I and II at a flea market once. I walked out without paying.","I can't believe I actually was in my own movie.","I got IRS records to finance what I wanted to do.","I live on this nice three acres in Hollywood.","I love punk rock, but I also love metal.","I really feel kind of guilty spending 80 million dollars. People are starving in the world.","I was always into music. I think everyone is when they're a teenager, as a way to drown out the world.","If you are looking for a producer, try to contact established producers. Don't let the fear of theft paralyze you, or you will never get anywhere with it.","In other countries, it's a common thing to have outcast children running around the streets in packs, and I don't think we're so far away from it here.","It is fun to try figure out the things that really are real and the things that aren't.","It is the idea that it's a movie in a movie. So I did it.","It's really hard to imagine there ever being the kind of impact there was when punk rock happened in the late 70's. I wish there would be one big change like that again, but I don't know if that'll ever happen.","Me and Johnny Rotten have been talking about doing a movie of his book, No Irish, No Dogs, No Blacks. We have a script, so hopefully that's going to happen at some point in our careers.","Nobody wanted to touch Decline III when they found out what it was about.","Now, it's almost impossible to go out and do a film about a new form of music.","Rabid fans were literally jumping into the camera.","The first Decline I did was out of sheer love and appreciation for the music. In 1977, it was more about bands, because punk was a new form of music. It was groundbreaking and political.","There are thousands of directors in Hollywood.","This generation has given up on growth. They're just hoping for survival.","Those movies, Decline I and II and Suburbia, are dearly loved, but they never made any money. I didn't even have the rights for some of them.","When we did Wayne's World, it was 14 million dollars and they didn't bug us too much because they just thought it was some little movie that nobody was ever going to see. We showed them.","Your best protection is to have an established agent make the contact."],"Penelope Tree":["If someone asks me a question, it is very difficult not to answer honestly.","I think of the Sixties as being every man for himself.","I try to see what the priorities are and not get terribly fussed about things that don't matter. Not be swept away by feelings and emotions, which is my tendency."],"Penelope Wilton":["Some people will never change.","It's true, I've become one of those grumpy older women.","The trouble with anyone when they're unhappy or in a relationship they recognize is not working but don't know what to do about is that they can't see farther out than that. If the relationship is not working, if what was there isn't there anymore, you have to do something about it.","Mostly in life people are trying not to have emotions.","You don't go to a comedy and try to laugh. You laugh in spite of yourself. You don't just come on stage and cry. Something has pushed you to cry.","When you play someone who is an iconic figure you can't go into it lightly.","You can't look at people being crucified. Even if you know it is just pretend.","I find talking about acting very boring, having to come out with platitudes about how terribly nice everyone is. I would much rather just do it.","People in distress behave in a stressful way. They aren't all sweetness and light. They don't behave well when they are unhappy. That's just what I've observed.","I've never lost a grown-up child, but I have known loss.","I love the drive from York to Whitby over the moors - one of the great journeys, in my book.","I've learnt to listen. I don't think I always did listen.","I don't think I've been in a supporting role in any of the plays I've done, ever.","I've had very close relationships with some twentieth-century writers.","I have spent my whole life educating myself.","The thing about being an actor is that you turn into other people. You have to hide yourself a bit in order to let that other person come out.","I am drawn to characters that go on journeys, characters that are real people, that have life.","In my life, I've had estates in Russia, houses in Spain, in Norway, in the deep south of America.","I don't tell everyone my life history because if everyone knows your inside-leg measurement, how can you surprise them?","Acting attracts shy people and show-offs.","I don't really care any longer what other people think.","I can't understand why people so readily put themselves up to be humiliated.","You need to keep on doing things you have never done before in your career. You have to have a go."],"Peng Liyuan":["A child's first teacher is its mother.","There is a saying, 'Eyes are the windows to the soul.' It means, mostly, people can see through someone else by eye contact in seven seconds. I have a habit that if I meet someone I don't know, I'd like to look at her or his eyes on purpose. When my eyes lay on them, I can immediately see their true color.","As a singer, I have won the highest honours in China. Actually I am like the panda: we are both national treasures.","Making sure that mothers are educated means we can lift more people out of poverty and build a more inclusive and sustainable society.","My daughter likes Korean drama more than I do.","I feel strongly about HIV/AIDS and children because I'm a famous singer, a public figure, and I'm a female and a mother. I have the responsibility and the passion to help out and do whatever I can.","I was a born singer."],"Penn Badgley":["Money is... I'm very conscious of it because I have it. It's powerful, man. It can change you ever so slightly, ever so slowly, and all of a sudden you're addicted to a million-dollar lifestyle and you've got no choice but to make a bad movie.","I think pineapple is very sexy. It reminds me of bikinis and the beach.","When you come to L.A. as a kid with your mom, you're lured into doing things that you think are cool and fun and a good idea, but they're cheesy and awful. And recording a pop single was one of them.","I don't believe in auditioning. I'm a bad auditioner. I don't like it.","For a while I didn't believe in marriage. But I think I do believe in having a love. I'm not saying only one love ever, but in having a good, solid relationship. I think that's possible.","I couldn't date someone who didn't like dogs. There are exceptions to the rule, but I find that if someone doesn't like animals, I am a little suspicious of them.","I've always loved music. I listen to music the way a lot of actors watch movies.","I realize I stare at everyone, especially when I'm walking down the street. I'm just a curious person.","The 'Gossip Girl' idea and ideologies, like, they sort of encourage this certain kind of, like, materialism and superficiality that isn't, I would say, the best thing in the world.","I want to be an actor - I don't want to be a celebrity. They are two different things, and people have forgotten that they are different.","Like, if you are a celebrity, then anyone will let you be in a film or on a TV show, and if you're an actor, chances are if you are successful, you are becoming a celebrity.","You know, as an only child, you're kind of in a bubble, and there are all sorts of things about my childhood that I still can't really place.","I guess I never really had a high school experience. I went for about a month, and on the first day one of my friends got punched in the eye. It was Southern California Public High School. Needless to say, I wasn't there for long."],"Penn Jillette":["It's amazing to me how many people think that voting to have the government give poor people money is compassion. Helping poor and suffering people yourself is compassion. Voting for our government to use guns to give money to help poor and suffering people is immoral, self-righteous, bullying laziness.","For better or worse, in the 21st century, reality shows are the variety show.","Religion is faith. Faith is belief without evidence. Belief without evidence cannot be shared. Faith is a feeling. Love is also a feeling, but love makes no universal claims. Love is pure.","There is this tremendous amount of arrogance and hubris, where somebody can look at something for five minutes and dismiss it. Whether you talk about gaming or 20th century classical music, you can't do it in five minutes. You can't listen to 'The Rite of Spring' once and understand what Stravinsky was all about.","'Psycho' is fascinating philosophically, because the point of 'Psycho' is that everything that's bad happens because of love.","Religion cannot and should not be replaced by atheism. Religion needs to go away and not be replaced by anything. Atheism is not a religion. It's the absence of religion, and that's a wonderful thing.","Democracy without respect for individual rights sucks. It's just ganging up against the weird kid, and I'm always the weird kid.","If you like the stuff I do, my chances of liking you go up.","Once you have somebody that is telling you, 'We are interpreting God for you,' it seems like you either agree or you don't. You either say, like Martin Luther, 'I'm going to have a direct relationship with the word of God,' or I'm going to go through a conduit of God on Earth,' which would be the Pope.","Tolerance is you saying something crazy and me smiling and saying, 'That's nice.'","Behaving morally because of a hope of reward or a fear of punishment is not morality. Morality is not bribery or threats. Religion is bribery and threats. Humans have morality. We don't need religion.","Bacon is so good by itself that to put it in any other food is an admission of failure. You're basically saying, 'I can't make this other food taste good, so I'll throw in bacon.'","Poker has the feeling of a sport, but you don't have to do push-ups.","The vast majority of people who have mental illness problems never hurt anybody.","The only secret of magic is that I'm willing to work harder on it than you think it's worth.","If you want to turn out an atheist child, unconditional love constantly is a good way to do it.","When you look at the actual numbers, the number of people who died after 9/11 was greater than the number of people who died in 9/11, even if you are talking Americans. But you know, I don't like to talk Americans. I want to talk everybody. More innocent people died after 9/11 because of 9/11 than died in 9/11.","Everyone's goals are the same with very small differences. I mean, the goal of a socialist and the goal of a libertarian are exactly the same. The goals are happiness and security and freedom, and you balance those.","When you're watching Psycho, there' s that moment when you have a visceral reaction to watching someone being stabbed. And then you have the intellectual revelation that you're not, and that's where the celebration comes in.","I like things matching. I have an upright bass, a drum kit and a grand piano that's the same color. I tend to overthink things.","I never wanted to be a magician. I never wanted to be a comedian. I never wanted to be onstage.","Direct confrontation, direct conversation is real respect. And it's amazing how many people get that.","When I was 15, 16, 17 years old, I spent five hours a day juggling, and I probably spent six hours a day seriously listening to music. And if I were 16 now, I would put that time into playing video games.","Every day, TV, newspapers, and the Internet bombard us with a message that we're destroying the earth. Ice caps are melting, rivers are dying, polar bears are drowning, and trees are doing something.","Don't waste too much time wishing, hoping, and being envious; it'll make you bugnutty.","I believe the fast track to atheism is reading the Bible. I've read it three times all the way through. It's a big part of our culture, a big part of our history. I don't just read things I agree with.","The medium is not the message - the message is the message.","I was always a little embarrassed when there was an act on television that requires a great deal of skill but is a little goofy, and the host comes over and acts like the person doing this skill is some sort of fool for having learned to do something that's very, very difficult.","Cars mean nothing to me. I'm not a car guy.","The highest ideals are human intelligence, creativity and love. Respect these above all.","The definition of a stupid thing is something that if you do everything right, you still get hurt. Fire-eating and love are stupid things.","People like Bill Maher, who brags about being a cynic, it sickens me. I am the least cynical person I know, and I am very, very skeptical.","I have a very specific definition of censorship. Censorship must be done by the government or it's not censorship.","We knew that we were kind of odd and creeps, and we wanted to do odd, creepy stuff for people who wanted to see that.","Everybody wants clean, safe energy. Some people think nuclear is the way to go. Some people think coal is the way to go. Some people think wind is the way to go. And there's always balances on that.","My body really, really wanted to reproduce when I was 15. It took a lot of civilization, socialization, willpower and some emulsion polymerization technology for me not to reproduce at 15.","You have two choices with Obama. You either believe that he is a man of Christ... or you think he's a liar. And I'm surprised by the number of atheist free thinkers that support Obama, and their argument is essentially, 'He's lying about being religious 'cause you have to do that to get elected.' It's a horrible reason to like somebody.","When I was a kid, politicians wanted to avoid talking about religion if they could. John F. Kennedy couldn't duck the issue, being Catholic and all. So how did he address it? By reminding Americans that religion shouldn't be an issue, that he was concentrating on big things like poverty and hunger and leading the space race.","World War II proves there's no God.","The skills that we have are the actual magic skills - not the performing skills. We have to separate those. But the actual skills that make the tricks work, we don't get to use again.","I am a huge fan of proselytizing. I am a huge fan of speaking your mind. The only way we can share the universe... is by talking very strongly about what we believe.","Performers have the right to say what they want to, and anyone paying money has the right to accept or reject the art and entertainment that's available.","Charities are really good. To a certain extent, the ones you pick are arbitrary.","'Celebrity Apprentice' has more integrity and is the most straightforward show I've ever seen.","I'm not misunderstood. I am brash. I make my living being brash.","Obama is a great leader. He can fire people up and get them to do what he wants.","Everybody prefers to see a nut - they're more fascinating.","Jay-Z, he knows precisely who he's going for - 14-year-old white suburban girls.","I'm an amazing mama's boy.","From 1985 to 1994, I lived in Manhattan in a big old loft right off Times Square. I could walk to work, which was in a couple of Broadway theaters, to Howard Stern's studio, and to 30 Rock for 'Letterman' and 'SNL.' Even in New York, walking to work is homey and folksy, like living in a small town.","I was about 12 when I heard my first Lenny Bruce record. He was already dead. But it changed my life and really did change the world.","I've voted Libertarian as long as I can remember, but I don't really remember much before the Clintons and the Bushes. Those clans made a lot of us bugnutty.","It's only the losers named 'Dave' that think having an unusual name is bad, and who cares what they think? They're named 'Dave.'","I'm totally clean and sober my whole life.","I'm a big fan of gospel music, and you cannot be a fan of rock and roll, you cannot be a fan of country western music, and you can't really be a fan of jazz without listening to a lot of music that's religious.","Teller and I worked Renaissance Festivals and street performing - actually more real, no kidding around, Philadelphia street performing than we did Renaissance Festivals.","One of the things that Teller and I are obsessed with, one of the reasons that we're in magic, is the difference between fantasy and reality.","If I had to imagine omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent power in the universe that chose to make my mother suffer, I don't know how I would make that make sense in the universe.","In reality, many people let go of religion later in life.","The purpose of art is to collide the intellectual and visceral together at the highest speed possible.","Whereas you have someone like Houdini, who works really, really hard to get really, really famous, and then has actual intellectual ideas that he puts into the culture that stay there.","We aren't people who believe that just because we're performers our opinions on everything need to be known.","The only place we were really told to tone it down - where other people would use the word censorship, but I wouldn't - was when we did MTV right after the Beavis and Butt-head thing.","The First Amendment says nothing about your getting paid for saying anything. It just says you can say it. I don't believe that if a corporation pulls all the money out of you or a network pulls their money away or you get fired, you're being censored.","The fact is that violence gives you a rush.","It wasn't success, because Teller and I, by the time Asparagus Valley got together - within a year, we had achieved all our goals. I mean, our goal was to earn our living doing exactly what we wanted. Which is many people's goal.","In my private life, I'm not around any drugs or alcohol.","If I go out to dinner with you and you order wine, I leave. I won't be around drugs and alcohol at all.","I've never had a drink of alcohol or any drug in my life.","I'm a hardcore libertarian - I want everything legal - but I also believe that you have the right to free association.","I'm a big fan of huge populations of people, so you'd think with 300 million people in the country, you don't even have to please 1% to be phenomenally successful.","But it's much more exciting to make Die Hard. One of the reasons that I think that movie is so successful is it deals with those very important blue-collar relationship themes. But it's more visually beautiful to show things blowing up. It just gives you more on the screen.","Before you can read, you know the difference between a story and reality. And, of course, by the time you're old enough to do any real damage with an Uzi, you've learned that difference.","If you want to talk about magic, the stuff that blows me away is the stuff that's done close up.","A joke is a way to say, 'I'm going to do something funny now. If I don't get a laugh at the end, I'm a failure.'","I started out as a juggler, so I know what it means to spend eight hours a day, seven days a week practicing something that people just dismiss with a wave of hand.","If there are two things Penn & Teller stand for, it's the truth & lying, although not necessarily in that order.","I think the media spends a lot of time fooling itself.","I don't know what's best for other people.","I came to magic absolutely hating magic on a very, very deep level.","Modern American magic, late 20th century magic, is tremendously disrespectful of the audience.","I think people under age 55 come to Vegas with a certain sense of irony.","When I buy Windows 98, I'm not only buying something useful, I'm giving money to Bill Gates, which is a really good thing.","Bob Saget is the dirtiest comic who's ever lived. Nobody touches him.","Magic is the Special Olympics of entertainment.","Comedy is taken care of by a free market.","You have in Vegas the most heterogeneous audience you're gonna get anywhere in the country. In Boston, Chicago, Miami, you know who goes to the theater. In Vegas, you have people who only see one theater show a year, and it's in Vegas.","Poker would have never gotten on TV when we only had three networks.","I believe in individual rights so much that I don't like any sort of 'what's good for the cause'-type questions.","'Moxie' is a name that was created by an American for the first national soft drink and then went on to mean chutzpah, and that's nice.","The secret truth of 'Celebrity Apprentice' is that it isn't very hard... 'Celebrity Apprentice' is easy like junior high is easy. All the arithmetic, the creative writing and the history are super simple, but like junior high, you do that easy work surrounded by people who are full-tilt, hormone-raging bug nutty.","No one can tell you the rules of 'Celebrity Apprentice.' No one. Donald Trump just does what he wants, which is mostly pontificating to people who are sucking up to him, while the network people try to manipulate him into making the highest-rated show they can.","If you spend a lot of time lying to people, you think a lot about what the truth means.","It is really funny to see people that you know acting unpleasantly just because there are TV cameras on.","I'm very happy being big and effeminate.","My hair is way, way long. I've hitchhiked across the country a zillion times. I've ridden in every car. I was never a hippie. It takes more than long hair.","To drive a car in rural America is freedom. Before I had a car, I'd never seen a rock and roll show, I'd never seen a comic or a show.","We celebrities are desperate pigs.","Penn & Teller stopped doing practical jokes, and the reason is we got much too good at it.","Technology adds nothing to art.","Part of the experience of being entertained is sitting back and plugging into someone else's vision.","As much as I disagreed with every second of 'Fahrenheit 9/11,' the fact that it is out made me jump for joy.","I love when violent, dangerous art is done by people who are not violent and dangerous. I love that when George Romero was making 'Dawn of the Dead,' he was coaching his son's little league team.","I love the idea that horror and fear is a celebration of health and life.","The pure unadulterated disgust of Washington seems to me to be a really good thing.","I don't believe in vengeance. Really, when all is said and done, I probably don't believe in punishment.","This is going to sound horrible, but I don't even know how much I make in a year. It must be, you know, a couple of million dollars, a few million. I know it's more money than my dad, a jail guard, made in his lifetime; more money than I'll ever need.","The vast majority of people who have guns never hurt anybody.","Even if I disagree with Obama on many, many things, he is certainly qualified to be president. He is certainly competent to be president.","For the most part, any serious magic show is not using very much technology newer than theatrical lights.","I like to read in the dark. I like to go into the bathtub, turn out all the lights, and in the dark, read my books.","I think voting for the lesser of two evils in game theory always leads to more evil.","I like movies that are scary, but I don't want them to be dirt dumb. I want a movie that gets my blood racing, makes me laugh, but also gives me something to think about, with maybe a little sexy thrown in. Hollywood doesn't make movies like that.","The one kind of person I have a lot of trouble understanding is the kind of person that says the existence of God or religion doesn't matter, it's not an important decision. I think it's vitally important; it's what all our lives are based on.","I have no evidence that libertarianism leads to a better life. I just think it is morally right.","If you don't pay your taxes and you don't answer the warrant and you don't go to court, eventually someone will pull a gun. Eventually someone with a gun will show up. I want everything the government does to be done, I just want it to be done voluntarily.","My parents were teetotalers and my grandparents were - it's all the way back. It's New English puritanical tradition.","Trey Parker did 'Book of Mormon.' It's the best Broadway show I've ever seen. He does 'South Park.' It's wonderful.","I'm always fascinated by the use of the first-person plural talking about sports.","You have to be careful as a libertarian because you can sound very Republican.","I don't want people who are in poverty, in pain, or suffering, to suffer because it's for their own good and they can pull themselves up by their bootstraps. I want to help them. I want us all to help them.","I don't think I'm made of the right stuff to be a politician. I think I'm made to be a loose cannon.","People still seem to think that they should vote themselves money. They seem to think there is stuff which they think is the government's job, when it's really the individual's job.","The Tea Party claims to want small government.","'Zolten' is a common Hungarian name, it's my wife's maiden name and most importantly, it's the name of Dracula's dog.","Believing there's no God means I can't really be forgiven except by kindness and faulty memories. That's good; it makes me want to be more thoughtful. I have to try to treat people right the first time around.","Everybody is designing magic iPhone apps that do things that are really, really beautiful, but a really important thing about magic is that the gimmick has to be ugly.","When you tell other people to do stuff they don't know how to do, they tend to freak out.","The only difference between Obama and Bush is that Obama is killing more people.","All David Blaine is is a good-looking magician.","I don't speak for all Libertarians any more than Sean Penn speaks for all Democrats.","Asking someone else to do something immoral is immoral.","A two-party system is way too good for those two parties.","There is no reason for the government to limit political speech.","Showbiz is just there to give people something to talk about.","We need a president who realizes that there's no government business in show business.","I'm not bothered by the idea of getting old, or I guess you could say by having arrived at old. I was 10 when my mom turned 55. For 1955, she was a very old mom.","If I were trying to avoid embarrassment, I wouldn't have stumbled my way through 'Dancing with the Stars.'","I intend to do the Penn & Teller show until they pry my cheesy magic wand from my cold dead fingers.","Penn & Teller don't know jack about global warming.","The reason I'm an I.B.M.-type guy today is that I really needed a laptop back in 1986, and I just couldn't wait for the Powerbook.","Computers absolutely changed my life. Before I had a computer, I had never written one thing. Not one thing. I'm a very bad speller and I was embarrassed by that. When I would type, the little mistakes would make me nutty, and I would never edit anything.","My love of computers, besides being practical, is very direct and visceral. I love the way things look on the screen.","Religion is often just tribalism: pride in a group one was born into, a group that is often believed to have 'God' on its side.","Building a professional relationship on respect as opposed to affection is a very good idea. Running your art projects the way you'd run a dry-cleaning business is also a really good idea. You shouldn't go into work like you're going on a date, like you're hanging out with friends.","Juggling is very, very straightforward; very, very black and white; you're manipulating objects, not people. And that's always appealed to me.","There are performers who have built their whole career doing magic on TV and can't really perform live at all - don't really have jobs and skills.","I'm always surprised when the corporate world does stupid things, because they're often not very stupid in hindsight.","I believe very much that the most damning thing you can say about Muslims is that you're afraid to say anything because they'll hurt you.","I will forever stick up for Catholics and Christians in general. With a small number of very horrible exceptions, they do play by the rules.","I do believe that a belief in God is crazy, but that doesn't mean that the people who believe in it are crazy. Those are two different things. Ideas can be stupid and crazy, and the people who hold those ideas are not necessarily stupid and crazy.","The most important part of life is work, it's the flow, it's getting stuff done, feeling like you're doing something.","I don't question things that go against what I believe very much. But boy, the stuff that I really want to believe, I really question a lot.","I grew up as a Christian. I suppose at some level I wanted to believe someone was watching over me.","You should think about the world and feel about your heart.","I have more contact with people who consume, for lack of a better word, my product than any other performers."],"Penny Jordan":["A thoughtful cup of tea brought to your bedside each morning means more to me than the huge bouquet of flowers bought once a year.","What I like writing about are people's relationships, not necessarily great big dramatic things but the smaller things in life and how they affect characters and challenge and change the people that they are. I do like a happy ending, so my books have to have a happy ending.","It's not very glamorous. People certainly wouldn't think so if they saw me sitting in my woolly socks at the kitchen table. Many times I sit at the typewriter and think, 'Why am I doing this?'","I chose to write the kind of romance I love best - one with a sheikh hero.","There are two questions that you ask yourself as a writer, and one of them is, 'But why?' The question that takes the book forward is, 'What if? What if x y or z happened? How would those characters react?'","I was still an avid reader of Mills & Boon romances - on publication day, I used to rush out of work to get to the local book store to grab my favourites before they all disappeared.","The appeal of romance is love. And that's universal.","I was too ashamed and afraid to confide in friends, and wanted to convince others and myself that my marriage was a success. I lost myself in my writing. Finding ways for my characters to overcome their problems and make their relationships work helped plaster over the wound caused by my inability to make things right at home.","I was always a keen reader. I jotted down one or two things, but it never occurred to me to think of a job in writing. I thought that writers were like demi-gods. I don't know what I thought.","Writing for Mills and Boon taught me a lot of discipline. You have to produce books in a short time scale and four a year, and it teaches you a lot."],"Penny Junor":["My house is full of paintings by my mother Pam. She was a fantastic, prolific artist but had no confidence in herself, thanks to my father running her down. They married during the war when she was 19 - she had planned to go to art school. But my father didn't want her to work, so she became a housewife.","William's marriage to Kate Middleton showed that social class, which seemed so important when Prince Charles was looking for a bride in the Eighties, is no longer an issue.","Becoming pregnant can be difficult at the best of times.","Britain has had some very strong and successful queens throughout history, but, since the Act of Succession in 1701, they have only been eligible to take the throne if they had no brothers. If there was a boy in the family, no matter where he came in the order of birth, he leapfrogged his sisters to take the title.","My loyalty is to myself, actually. I don't know if it's to my readers.","I feel that if I'm writing a book, it has to be an honest book: it has to say what I believe to be the truth, so that's kind of warts and all.","I don't think the monarchy is tawdry in the slightest. I think the monarchy is hugely important for Britain.","The monarchy needs publicity: they must be seen to be relevant. Unfortunately, they can't just lead quiet lives.","For much of the final decade of the 20th century, one story regularly dominated the news across much of the developed world. It was the unravelling of the marriage between the heir to the British throne and his beautiful, charismatic princess, Diana.","Africa is the one place on earth where Prince Harry can be truly himself. He describes Botswana as his 'second home,' but this magical country is even more than that - it is his haven, his safe harbour.","Kenya has deep resonances for the royals: it was here, after all, that the young Princess Elizabeth heard of the death of her father, George VI. From that moment, she was Queen.","I confess I'm a huge fan of 'Suits.'","Compared with the rest of the Royal Family, Charles is a thoroughly Renaissance man, moved by beauty, music, and art in a way that largely passes his parents, his siblings, and his sons by.","Because I am fascinated by people and what makes them behave the way they do. I think it is one of the most fascinating things in the world.","I had a very difficult father. I lived in a war zone. My parents were very unhappy, and I lived through my mother's pain. Throughout my childhood, I was constantly trying to protect her from my father.","I've got terrible hate mail basically saying I'm vile and evil.","The fact is, Charles and Diana's marriage was a train smash in many ways, and, as Camilla will one day be Queen, it's important for the public to understand she's not some terrible woman.","Everything in adulthood can be traced back to childhood.","When Sir Michael Peat arrived from Buckingham Palace in 2002 to take up the job as Prince Charles's private secretary, he came with a clear agenda. His instructions from the Queen were to sever Charles's relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles because it was a mess and was detracting from his work.","I have watched people around members of the royal family for a long time now, and something very strange happens to them. They turn into sycophants.","Public disapproval is the price I pay for writing about the royals.","I wasn't a pushy parent - you have to let children be who they want to be.","Prince Charles has his foibles, but he is not a crook, not a bully, and not a hypocrite.","At one time, my mother did plan to divorce my father when she found out about an affair he had with a model, the sister of one of my brother's girlfriends.","I have huge sympathy for Prince William. He was born into a deeply unenviable life that most of us would abhor, and what's more, he lost his mother at an early age.","Kate Middleton is intelligent, good looking, kind, and fun, and she is remarkably normal.","Kate Middleton has no blue blood coursing through her veins. Her father, Michael, is self-made, and he and his wife have been very successful with their party business, but they are and always will be strictly middle class.","Diana became a superstar when she became a part of the Royal Family because she brought youth and glamour and fun into a staid and dusty institution, and at times she eclipsed the Prince of Wales. It was one of the early problems within their marriage.","Cats, it turns out, are even less fond of being dunked in water than Shitsus."],"Penny Lancaster":["I really do believe that being naturally beautiful is what is inside and what shines through.","I'm lucky that I have a supportive partner who loves me when I'm bigger as well as slim.","As long as you try your best, that is all that matters. You don't have to be the fastest runner or top of the class.","There's less pressure to look good as you get older.","I do love fish, and I thought it was healthy without understanding the high mercury levels that fish like tuna, swordfish and halibut can contain.","If I had a partner who asked when I was going to the gym or commented that I was eating too much or asked if I really needed an extra potato, that would make me feel awful. It would be terrible.","I modelled in my 20s, and it was an obsessive time. I was under pressure to look a certain way.","I think there's always interest in how the other half live - I see myself as a down-to-earth Essex mum who just happens to be living this very glamorous life in Beverly Hills.","I'm a pretty organised traveller."],"Penny Marshall":["If you're not having a good time, find something else that gives you some joy in life.","I have a good support system of friends and family.","I wasn't like a girly girl. I was a tomboy.","You had to learn at a certain age what sarcasm is, you know?","I do talk like a truck driver sometimes, or I curse. What can I say?","I like arts and crafts.","I don't know one lens from another. That's not my job. It's the cinematographer's job. But I can talk to people.","My brother and sister were much older. They were planned. I was not planned for. I was called the mistake, amongst other things.","It's better for me to go up against someone's passion with my passion and then clarifying something that he wrote. Then I know how to work around certain things.","I live in L.A., so I go to basketball games. But I love baseball.","I don't mind if somebody texts me but I'm not a big texter, the things are too small. I don't mind if they text, '7 o'clock,' that's fine, that's logistics but, 'What's up?' Get real! Pick up a phone!","I tell stories so only the independents do that and they don't pay you that much. I'd rather do TV or an HBO movie.","I wish I could sing better.","In my opinion, life is more important than show business.","My family is well, and that's what's important.","I think everyone's mother is slightly nuts.","I was born and raised in the Bronx and my grandfather and my brother Garry were huge Yankees fans. One of my first memories is of them listening to a game on the radio and screaming at the radio. My brother would cry when they lost, and when I was really little, I didn't know why he was crying.","We all used to collect baseball cards that came with bubble gum. You could never get the smell of gum off your cards, but you kept your Yankees cards pristine.","Yankee Stadium was the only thing we had in the Bronx. It was an institution.","I would much rather feel comfortable and feel beautiful, than to feel uncomfortable, but look fantastic.","The truth is that I am not a frump... I just enjoy being laid back.","People who text a lot are not my favorite thing.","I have a strange combination of fearlessness and massive insecurity.","Once I commit to something, I complete it. If I say 'no,' I mean 'no.' I just have to learn how to say 'no' more.","I'm not a hockey fan. I'm not a golf fan.","I have season tickets to the Lakers and the Clippers.","I have a grandson who is 20. He's a computer guy. I'm worried that he can't communicate without his machine. They have no personal contact with people. That's the bad part of technology.","When I'm working, I'm obsessively working.","I'm not the most positive person.","I'm very happy to watch a video at home with a friend rather than do dinner.","I'm not someone who has had to deal with much personal drama outside of the usual: growing up with parents who hated each other, two marriages and divorces of my own. There was the cancer thing, too.","I've directed seven movies and know a thing or two about dealing with unexpected crises.","I don't startle easily.","My mother was pretty nuts, but she was also a character.","I do feel it's important to entertain people. I try to.","I'll try anything. What are they gonna do, kick me out of show business?","Look at YouTube, how many talented people there are. It's a whole new world of how to express yourself. I don't know how to work that world, but take advantage of it.","You need to see what the actor needs. This one wants to be talked to privately. That one doesn't mind if you block it for them. Just tell me the truth and I'll adapt to it.","Movie stars are insecure like everyone else. That's why they go into acting!","I want you to laugh and cry. That's what I do."],"Penny Pritzker":["I tend to be a person who starts with the presumption that I should trust you until you abuse the privilege, and then our relationship is forever changed. That's a very big line, and chances are it's not going to work if it's crossed. I warn people that this is how I'm going to deal with it.","Businesses need to define what they need so training providers can offer up the right training.","What I've learned is that the most troublesome people don't tell you 100% of the story, and keep some facts to themselves. They just don't give you the full picture, and that's very worrisome to me.","I grew up in the motel business, and it evolved into hotels.","I wanted to build businesses from the time I was little.","After I got my law degree and business degree, I went to work for my family, and I spent two years at Hyatt doing a training program. I was really interested in real estate - one reason was that nobody in my family was doing that. I was looking for a place where I could be successful doing something that was my own.","I grew up in a household that revered building businesses. It wasn't thinking about leadership; it was more about building something. To build something, you ultimately have to lead."],"Pep Guardiola":["We need the whole squad, every player of the team, if we are to be successful.","The result is an empty thing. The result is I'm happy for the next two days because I get less criticism and more time to improve my team. But what satisfies me the most in my job is to feel emotions, the way we play.","As time goes by, people get to know you better. They pose problems for you, and you have to come up with solutions.","In some times of the game, you have to be more simple.","For my experience, my family. I will always be grateful for the people who brought me here.","In football, the worst things are excuses. Excuses mean you cannot grow or move forward.","I'm sorry, but until my last day as a coach, I will try to play from my goalkeeper.","I am here just to learn, to improve, to help my team improve.","I need time, but as soon as possible, we are going to try to create team spirit. That is the most important thing. After that, you can create tactics, but we have to create something special with ourselves.","The fans can accept a poor performance, but they won't take it when you choose not to put in the effort.","The most difficult thing in football is to score a goal.","All the managers in the world, it doesn't matter how good you are, if your players don't understand what you are looking for or what you want, it makes no sense.","Barcelona are special in the way they play. They're a machine.","People always think the coach is the strongest person at a club, the boss, but in truth, he's the weakest link. We're there, vulnerable, undermined by those who don't play, by the media, by the fans. They all have the same objective: to undermine the manager.","At Barcelona, I had the best players ever, and they helped me to be a successful manager.","I want the ball for 90 minutes. When I don't have the ball, I go high pressing because I want the ball.","I don't want players who don't want to stay.","This was how Johan Cruyff worked. He was demanding a lot, but when you got there, and you were in his team, he was an incredible protector. He would push and push you, and then he would protect you. He was a master at handling players. He knew when you needed to be pushed or protected.","Maybe Klopp is the best manager in the world at creating teams who attack the back four with so many players, from almost anywhere on the pitch. They have an intensity with the ball and without the ball, and it is not easy to do that.","When you're out on the touchline, like a winger, it is easier to play. You see everything: the mess, the crowd, the activity is all inside. When you play inside, you don't see anything in there because so much is happening in such a small space and all around you.","Let us fight until the end. Let me try at least that - fight.","A perfectionist? That's part of my job.","I want to win. I want to play serious. I want to be effective.","I don't like it when a player says, 'I like freedom; I want to play for myself.' Because the player has to understand he is part of a team with 10 other players. If everyone wants to be a jazz musician, it will be chaos. They will not be a team, and nothing will be possible.","For the last decade, the last 50 years, Barcelona dominate football matches. I love the way they play.","You know what happens in all the big companies and business in the world. If something doesn't work, you have to find a solution.","From my point of view, I always want to fight until the end of my last chance.","In Barcelona, Bayern Munich, in Spain and Germany we were able to do it. But people say, 'You only did it because you were in Barcelona and Bayern Munich. You will not be able to do it in England.' So, let's do it. We are going to try.","It's natural for players to be relaxed, so you have to be there to say, 'You have to do it again and again and again.'","I am here to change anything. I'm here to adapt. The critieria between a yellow and red card. What is a foul and what is not.","To score four times against an Italian team when you trail 2-0 is a big deal.","Creating something new is the difficult part. To make it and build it and get everyone to follow? Amazing.","We all feel that hunger in football. With Cruyff, it was different. He deepened and changed the hunger so you became conscious of why you are getting better.","I am not a coach for the tackles, so I do not train them.","Tactics are so important because everybody has to know what they have to do on the pitch. The relationships and behaviours off the pitch between team-mates have to be as good as possible.","I will not be on the bench until I am 60 or 65 years old.","You hear all these people saying, 'Oh, Pep, what a good manager he is.' Forget about it. Cruyff was the best, by far.","The Premier League is so difficult.","I don't want preconceptions. I want to learn as much as possible.","Our job is to convince guys that our way is the best way to cross the road. The tactics and training and facilities are important, but I still have to convince you.","The fundamentals, what I want, which is to take the ball, try to play as offensive as possible and dominate the game through the ball, is the same. I grew up with that; I was a player with that idea, and I am a coach with that idea.","We have to cut out some of our mistakes, but the main thing in English football is controlling the second ball. Without that, you cannot survive.","I thank Manchester City for giving me the opportunity to train these amazing players.","When you train a massive club or little third division outfit, when you go out to play football in any situation, it is always about winning.","I enjoy every day in Manchester. I am confident we can make a step forward to make people proud of us.","There are footballers who are very good playing on the outside but don't know what to do inside. Then there are players who are very good inside but don't have the physique, the legs, to go outside.","The people say I have to change? Well, the people have to tell me what I should do to change.","The reason we are here is thinking, 'What can we do to make this club a better club?' I don't want the guys to think about what the club can do for them.","It doesn't mean my footballing ideas are special, different, better than the others. I am not saying it's my football, my ideas, and the other coaches are nothing. It's the way I believe. I'm not special.","We try to play football; don't forget it, right. My teams always in my career try to play football. I cannot control the other circumstances.","I am so happy when I feel emotion about the way my team plays.","All the managers in the world are here to win games.","I have to understand the rules here in England.","I won 21 titles in seven years: three titles per year playing in this way. I'm sorry, guys. I'm not going to change.","We cannot change absolutely everything in one season.","People usually think that it is the coach who has to raise the spirits of his players; that it is the coach who has to convince his footballers; that it is his job to take the lead all the time. But that's not always the case.","I don't think in the big clubs in Europe you can find three strikers with an average age of 20.","I would like to involve and love to work with young players.","Manchester City has a really good academy, and they're winning titles at all ages.","People say, 'Pep won in Barca, but it was boring,' or, 'Pep won in Bayern, but it was boring.' I understand that. But games won, goals scored, goals conceded, titles... sorry, guys, it was good!","People say you must be pragmatic, more clinical. More pragmatic than me? I'm sorry.","I think all managers have to be so demanding.","Sometimes I was wrong about my players. Sometimes I want more and more from them; sometimes I am so demanding, but they showed me how good they are.","I won't be training at 60 years old, because I want to do something else in my life.","If I believed in it, and it wasn't productive for the team, I wouldn't do it.","I know the people expect the best - good. The people expect we'll play fantastic football and win games - good. I can't control that. I accept that, and I just focus on my players in the games.","I proved myself in Barcelona, and after I proved myself in Germany, I wanted to prove myself in England.","The players are coming to try every game, every weekend, so that the Manchester City people can be proud, and we will see what is our level to achieve our battles.","People want to be entertained. They don't want to be cheated.","People talk about tactics, but when you look at it, tactics are just players. You change things so that the team can get the most out of the skills they have to offer, but you don't go any further than that.","I want to feel the team is playing like I want. If not, why am I here?","Why am I here? Yes, to win titles, because then I will feel happy for the people. But the process is the reason why.","Alexis Sanchez would fit in any team in the world.","That unpredictable game here in England, that makes it so fascinating for the fans, because you never know what will happen.","Will I be a success? I don't know.","I understand and accept that for the people of Munich, only the treble will do.","Maybe one day I will work in Italy. If they want me.","You can win ten times, and then you are not able to win five times. I have to discover the reason why, and I am going to find that.","I try to be positive. I speak to my players about how we have to play, respect the rules. What I have done is always be positive.","What I have to do to make sure I don't lose some games in a row; I don't know.","I try to play in one way all my career and here, with high pressing, but it is different in England. Many times the ball is more in the air than the grass, and I have to adapt.","I want to play the football I feel.","I want to win games; I don't want to lose games.","I feel what I feel, and in the Premier League, there are some special things, but the pitch is the same. What I believe is good and will be good.","When you are 10 points behind, you have to be focused just on the next game.","If you want to win, you have to beat the big teams in Europe, and Juventus are awesome.","I started playing football young, and my career was on the pitch.","I want to feel I can help the club to believe they are good, and I want to feel the fans knowing the team is good. Sometimes you don't believe that because in the past, you have not won as many titles like the other ones.","It is one of the best clubs in the world by far. I'm loving Manchester City.","I am grateful to be here, and I will always be grateful for the opportunity Manchester City gave me.","At the end of the day, it's my players play against their players, and the end of the day, that's what's important.","I come here to be coach of Manchester City and train these players. That's the reason I am here.","It's a pleasure. We are lucky guys to be there in front of the millions and millions watching us.","I don't understand the lack of respect for amazing players when people say they are not good enough for me.","Sometimes when you miss out on points, it is a pity, it is a shame, because we tried to do everything in the game.","What happens in the Premier League is that when they arrive in the area, they punish you.","When Klopp speaks about his football being heavy metal, I understand completely. It is so aggressive. For the fans, it is really good.","I want happiness for the players.","I have a lot of respect for the careers of the players. They are with us, they are with me, and I treat them like professionals."],"Pepa":["I've always said, if you treat yourself like a queen, you'll attract a king.","There is nothing that you can't overcome. So it's never too late for happiness.","Ladies, you have to love yourself... you don't always have to have a man.","Our trademark asymmetrical hairstyle came about by accident. My sister was trying to get her beautician's licence, and I was her guinea pig. She permed my hair and didn't wash out one of the sides properly, so the whole right side of my hair was eaten out. After she washed it, I was half bald.","AC/DC 'Back in Black' - Those were my punk rock days.","Lack of communication is the key to any successful relationship going wrong.","We had fashion errors that became hits. We were bold with our colors and tights and being very sexy and the assymmetrical hairstyle.","There are good men out there. There are guys who have their priorities straight, who take care of their kids, who respect their mothers.","A lot of guys don't get their recognition, all the good men out there.","Parents need to sit down with their boys and girls and tell them how to carry themselves and tell the boys how to respect women and respect yourself and know who you are.","I wasn't from the streets, but I was in the streets. I had a good family, nice home - you know, I can't say I grew up with nothing... but I chose to hang in the streets.","I tried snowboarding before, and I suck at it.","I grew up with park jams. That's how I knew about rap... The local MCs would grab the mic and start rapping. I just used to be so in awe and fascinated and like, 'Wow, this is amazing!' But I would never, ever touch the mic. Heck no.","I do like performing 'I'll Take Your Man,' because that was a hard song.","'Push It,' to me, was very pop. And back then, you were called 'sell-out' to be pop.","Be empowered as a female, as a woman. Don't apologize. Don't lose yourself in another person's life.","We need to say to ourselves 'I'm talented, loved, worthy, and valued.'","I want to reach everyone, but I have a dedication to women. Being that I'm a woman myself, and with the things that I've gone through, I've dealt with a lot of women that are in the dark and blind about relationships who depend on men for their happiness, emotionally and financially.","The guys love us - they think we're sexy - but the girls take us seriously... I've always said that when I was a teenager growing up, I wish I had girls like Salt-n-Pepa to look up to. If I'd had someone I could relate to, a lot of things would probably be different.","For girls who want to get their waistline down a little bit and don't have any weights in the house, they can actually use a broom and put it behind their necks, lap over it and twist and squat. I do all of that if I don't go to the gym.","Women come up to us all the time and give us the most amazing compliments, like, 'Salt-N-Pepa was the soundtrack of my life.' They remind us that we meant so much to them. Sometimes artists don't really grasp that. But when you talk to fans, you get in touch with your legacy.","Fans make you understand it was more than music to them. It was a movement, a voice they felt they didn't have that we expressed for them.","There was a time when we had a nice little run: Eve, Lil' Kim, Queen Latifah, Missy Elliott, Lauryn Hill, Remy Ma, Da Brat - it goes on. But what I noticed is that a lot of talented females in hip-hop came out of a male camp.","We're not just three dumb girls from the ghetto who got lucky.","I'm gonna be in miniskirts at 50. Tina Turner.","There is a business side to me and a spiritual side.","I'm spiritual, too, but 'Gitty Up' is a great song, know what I mean?","I was a loudmouth rock star when I was still in college. Purple hair this week, green hair next week, blond hair the week after. I was doing that fashion before it was really cool.","We opened the door for women rappers.","Don't rationalize or internalize abusive behavior, because love doesn't hurt.","At the end of the day, your life is on the line when you're dealing with abusive men, and your life is more important than any man.","We brought fashion, fun, and femininity to hip hop.","Nowadays, everyone has a stylist - we were raw, wearing 8 ball jackets with kente hats and spandex. It's a quintessential look that everyone loved.","Some things I see on television, I think, 'Oh my gosh, they're showing that now?' wow.","It's tough, with the iTunes and all the downloads... You've really got to make an impact to be heard and be unique and different.","When I see a cutie in front at a concert, I say, 'Ohhh, you're so cute! What's your name?' But I wouldn't do that in real life.","We feel we're setting a trend. Other girl groups watch our style and see how we rap. And there are some male rappers I feel we've overthrown.","The women like us because we're the first real women rappers, and the men like us because we're strong. We're not some soft little rappers with soft little voices. The men who see us end up going, 'Hey! They're kickin' it!'","Onstage, we're very dominant and aggressive. But we laugh and play a lot, too.","We try to keep our audience involved. It is a show, but we want to make sure that everybody - us, them - has a good time.","Every group has its time. Nobody reigns forever, except Michael Jackson. So, you've gotta be ready for that - and be wise about what you're doing.","For a long time, we got no respect. People thought we just got lucky. They said we were a one-record wonder.","We'll be in our 60s performing 'Push It' somewhere. Good old 'Push It.' I don't know what it is about that song.","We've been fortunate. 'Push It' will never die.","Music has changed. You can just throw songs out on iTunes song by song; you don't have to do a whole album.","My kids used to see me crying and depressed all the time, and that can affect kids as well.","We all have little sisters and cousins who look up to us, and we see what they go through. So we have to be an example. A lot of artists come into this business and they don't see things that way. But as you get older - and now that we also have children - your conscience starts working on you.","You have to give your fans and your children something they can use in life.","'Shoop' is whatever you want it to mean. You just shooping around. Just shoop!","I like to look good. I'm well-respected, and I demand that - and I don't mind showin' off!","We've always been into God. We feel we are blessed. That's part of our success. I mean, apart from the chemistry and the talent, we are blessed. I don't think it can happen without God.","Girls are our biggest fans, I tell you. I mean women; I mean even the big ones. They say things like, 'You inspired me!'","Kids started coming to my concert, and I realized that I had sense of responsibility.","Not everyone's role model material, but we do have a sense of responsibility because kids listen more to us than they would their parents.","A lot of our fans, they always say Salt-N-Pepa and Spinderella was the soundtrack to their lives.","We're just not going anywhere. Our songs are here to stay.","Peter Jennings came to us and said to make a PSA, 'Let's Talk About AIDS.' But I was naive about how the virus is contracted - until Magic Johnson came out. I'd stereotyped it, thinking it was a gay disease, a white man's disease.","If I'm on a date, I don't want to talk business right away. Let it feel like a date. I don't want to talk about my job right then.","We never said we were hard-core or that we didn't want our music crossing over or being popular.","If you feel good about yourself, there's nothing wrong with showing your stuff.","We've always been for women and for biggin' up their self-esteem. That's why we do songs like 'Independent.'","We've never been political, and our fans like us that way. Music is supposed to be fun. But we do drop a positive message.","Don't waste your time with a good-for-nothing man.","We've been in the game for so long, it's great to be honored for our contributions to the game of hip-hop and be told that we're not forgotten about, that our music is timeless.","We're always going to party and have fun. We'll always be pushing it and leaving you with something to remember.","I'm not ashamed to speak about anything. And what I'm telling you is real; it's from the heart."],"Pepe Eliaschev":["I sometimes question whether journalists here are being asked to take up roles that are not ours.

The minute you start wondering, 'is it going to be wonderful enough?,' it never will be.","Women may give lip service to wanting husbands who take on an equal role in raising children, but many will pull rank when an important decision, like how to discipline or what baby sitter to hire, has to be made.","In the best of all possible worlds, February 14 is a pleasant and sentimental opportunity to lavish your partner with attention or move your relationship to the next level.","Not only is it not remarkable to be a single woman, there's no stigma attached. You see more and more women choosing to be single as well as happenstance."],"Per Petterson":["To say that a family is happy I think is to diminish it, taking out what is interesting. Growing up, I don't think my family was any happier or unhappier than anyone else's. My mother and father should have been divorced or never even married. On the other hand, I remember many moments of happiness.","'In the Wake' was a very bleak book. This relationship was not too good, the father and son. This time around, I wanted a father and a son who really loved each other, which would be visible on the first page and would still be there on the last page.","When you are a sentence-based writer, they have to be good. They have to be really on the spot. Because when you don't have a plot, really, what shall you rely on? Just language. And sometimes I am so afraid of writing the wrong thing, I just sit and wait for the right thing to come.","1989 was such a very, very important year in Europe. The wall fell, the Soviet Union was crumbling, and so many things happened - in 15 minutes, the world changed.","I admire American literature, both contemporary and classic - 'Moby-Dick' is just about the best book in the world - and I admire British literature for its insistence on dealing with social class. It may have been an influence.","If you're a Norwegian writer, you are not visible in the world. The door of the English language is very hard to open for a Norwegian writer.","There is always this quarrel about what is preferable: the straight, naturalistic, epic storytelling or the modernistic, disjointed, slightly hermetic one. To me it does not matter, as long as it's good. I like both kinds. Although the common reader seems to prefer the first, which is to be expected, and who would blame her?","I grew up in the city. Both my mother and father were factory workers, and I loved the life in the 'metro.' Everybody saw me as a very urban guy. And I was.","When my mother talked about her brother, there was this light in her eyes. I thought, 'This is the basis of a novel.'","To me, a book is a book. A novel is a novel, and you have hundreds of possibilities, options, and they may all be fine. Charles Dickens or Ingeborg Bachmann, Claude Simon or later writers. The one and only condition is that it has to be good: it has to have quality, substance, atmosphere.","The important discovery I made very early is that my novels had to be written without any given plan or outline. I can't do it in any other way. But then they are dependent on the sentences, my intuition, and, as I have experienced many times, the subconscious.","I was born in 1952, so obviously the sixties were important. That's when I came of age. It was also a revolutionary period, a complete break with the generation before us in terms of culture, literature, music, and in politics, of course. 1968 was an important year; I was 16, and the world became clear to me, visible, so to say.","I don't know if nature is a direct literary influence on my writing, but it is certainly important to me. I take great joy in writing about it. It is something I have taken with me from my childhood; the body exposed to the threat of the physical world and at the same time being at home in it.","I come from a working-class family. They're the people I know and the people I love, I guess. I do not write about them for political reasons, but because, as I see it, most interesting things - social, political, emotional - take place there. It's a bottomless well for an author like me.","Philosophically I am, or at least have been, a follower of Sartre. I am very interested in the choices we make, or don't make, in life-defining matters. That moment of 'angst' and its consequences can be such a cruel thing.","I decided if I couldn't be a writer, my life would be miserable. I had this imaginary room of references to all the books I had read, a kind of bubble, in which I lived.","Some critics said, 'Hey, why are you writing historical novels?' I say they're not historical, they're contemporary, because people walking around who lived through this, even a little bit, they carry it inside. The contemporary isn't just what you can see now.","I'm a family-based person, even though we didn't exactly have a very happy family. I was never in any doubt that this was a centre of writing.","I hate plots.","I write about families. That is who we are.","Making sentences is what I do. I mean, the story will come as I write.","I rely heavily on rhythm when I write. You should tap your foot when you read it, all the way through.","At first I wanted to go to university, but I really didn't dare to. I was too self-conscious, being a working-class kid. It was really difficult. I was going to study history, but the professor asked me some questions I didn't understand, and I didn't dare to ask what they meant. I left university and went to work in the Post.","A lot can change because you are embarrassed by something.","I worked in a bookstore in Oslo, importing the English-language books.","Living here where I live, on a farm way out in the countryside, in the woods, in fact, I have plenty of time to be alone, and I like it. I always have. I like my own company. And I am not the only one who feels this way; a high percentage of the Norwegian population feel as I do.","In a household tragedy, you are very much aware of being alone. It is something that is possible to grasp, and that is why it hurts so much. Because you are alone. I know a little about this.","I do not think of literature as something confessional or therapeutic. I make sentences in order to be precise about experiences and things. I am urged by many things and no things in particular.","I do consider myself a Norwegian writer, or a Scandinavian writer, as my family tree reaches into both Denmark and Sweden. I don't think about it, of course, when I am writing.","When a translation is very good, it is fascinating to see how the book changes and yet stays the same. I think 'Out Stealing Horses' sounds more American for Americans than it does in Norway, and still, it is all there, everything that I wrote. It's amazing.","To tell you the truth, I don't edit much at all. Most times, when I have finished the first draft, that's the book. Of course, I work on the page I am on until I am happy with it. I might even say that I try to state the landscape."],"Percy Bysshe Shelley":["Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.","O, wind, if winter comes, can spring be far behind?","History is a cyclic poem written by time upon the memories of man.","Soul meets soul on lovers' lips.","There is a harmony in autumn, and a luster in its sky, which through the summer is not heard or seen, as if it could not be, as if it had not been!","I have drunken deep of joy, And I will taste no other wine tonight.","Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.","Fear not for the future, weep not for the past.","A poet is a nightingale, who sits in darkness and sings to cheer its own solitude with sweet sounds.","When my cats aren't happy, I'm not happy. Not because I care about their mood but because I know they're just sitting there thinking up ways to get even.","Poetry is a mirror which makes beautiful that which is distorted.","We look before and after, And pine for what is not; Our sincerest laughter With some pain is fraught; Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.","Government is an evil; it is only the thoughtlessness and vices of men that make it a necessary evil. When all men are good and wise, government will of itself decay.","Nothing wilts faster than laurels that have been rested upon.","Obscenity, which is ever blasphemy against the divine beauty in life, is a monster for which the corruption of society forever brings forth new food, which it devours in secret.","Poetry is a sword of lightning, ever unsheathed, which consumes the scabbard that would contain it.","The pleasure that is in sorrow is sweeter than the pleasure of pleasure itself.","The more we study the more we discover our ignorance.","Change is certain. Peace is followed by disturbances; departure of evil men by their return. Such recurrences should not constitute occasions for sadness but realities for awareness, so that one may be happy in the interim.","Poetry lifts the veil from the hidden beauty of the world, and makes familiar objects be as if they were not familiar.","The great instrument of moral good is the imagination.","The soul's joy lies in doing.","When a thing is said to be not worth refuting you may be sure that either it is flagrantly stupid - in which case all comment is superfluous - or it is something formidable, the very crux of the problem.","Twin-sister of Religion, Selfishness.","Poetry is the record of the best and happiest moments of the happiest and best minds.","Death is the veil which those who live call life; They sleep, and it is lifted.","Only nature knows how to justly proportion to the fault the punishment it deserves.","All of us who are worth anything, spend our manhood in unlearning the follies, or expiating the mistakes of our youth.","If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?","First our pleasures die - and then our hopes, and then our fears - and when these are dead, the debt is due dust claims dust - and we die too.","Tragedy delights by affording a shadow of the pleasure which exists in pain.","Familiar acts are beautiful through love.","A man, to be greatly good, must imagine intensely and comprehensively; he must put himself in the place of another and of many others; the pains and pleasures of his species must become his own.","I think that the leaf of a tree, the meanest insect on which we trample, are in themselves arguments more conclusive than any which can be adduced that some vast intellect animates Infinity.","War is the statesman's game, the priest's delight, the lawyer's jest, the hired assassin's trade.","In a drama of the highest order there is little food for censure or hatred; it teaches rather self-knowledge and self-respect.","Love is free; to promise for ever to love the same woman is not less absurd than to promise to believe the same creed; such a vow in both cases excludes us from all inquiry.","Music, when soft voices die Vibrates in the memory.","Reason respects the differences, and imagination the similitudes of things.","Concerning God, freewill and destiny: Of all that earth has been or yet may be, all that vain men imagine or believe, or hope can paint or suffering may achieve, we descanted.","There is no real wealth but the labor of man.","Revenge is the naked idol of the worship of a semi-barbarous age.","The man of virtuous soul commands not, nor obeys.","Man's yesterday may never be like his morrow; Nought may endure but Mutability.","Is it not odd that the only generous person I ever knew, who had money to be generous with, should be a stockbroker.","Man has no right to kill his brother. It is no excuse that he does so in uniform: he only adds the infamy of servitude to the crime of murder."],"Percy Heath":["Jazz is letting everybody do his or her thing with the music.","I had to go to Europe to tour and he died on the second day of the tour."],"Percy Julian":["I don't think that you can possibly embrace the kind of joy which one who has worked with plants and plant structures such as I have over a period of nearly 40 years, how wonderful the plant laboratory seems.","I'm married to a dear little girl who holds a bachelor's degree from the University of Pennsylvania and a master's degree from the University of Pennsylvania and a Ph.D. degree from the University of Pennsylvania.","I remember, as a boy of 17 years of age, this was a fascinating thing for me: how we human beings breathe out carbon dioxide into the air, the leaves of plants pick this carbon dioxide up, and the plant gives off oxygen, which we can breathe in and keep our life going.","Fifty percent of the weight of the soybean is protein. And what a protein! No other protein that we've known comes so nearly to the basic protein of animals and humans as soybean protein."],"Percy Ross":["Many drops make a bucket, many buckets make a pond, many ponds make a lake, and many lakes make an ocean.","The world is full of genies waiting to grant your wishes.","A clever, imaginative, humorous request can open closed doors and closed minds.","He who gives while he lives, get to know where it goes.","You've got to ask! Asking is, in my opinion, the world's most powerful - and neglected - secret to success and happiness."],"Percy Sledge":["I am the type of guy that has always been the same all of my life. My classmates at our class reunion always say the same thing. They could not believe that, being a world artist, I still seem like I was when we were at school together.","As a kid, on the cotton fields, I had this tune in my head. I hummed it and sang it. It was the same melody as 'When A Man Loves A Woman.' I could never, ever forget it.","I was a little boy singing sad songs, about 9 or 10 years old in the woods. I listened to my voice coming back to me. It was as high as you could go. I dreamed of being famous as a singer when I was on those cotton fields. I wanted to see the world and meet people.","'Cover Me.' 'Take Time To Know Her.' 'Warm and Tender Love.' 'Out Of Left Field.' 'Dark End Of The Street.' 'Tears Me Up.' 'My Special Prayer.' All points back to one song. 'When A Man Loves A Woman.' The Grand-daddy to all of my songs. The boss of all of my songs. I have great respect for that song. Always will.","Guys like me and Ray Charles, when we was coming up through our days, country music and soul music was just a very thin line between the two.","I'd liked this girl all through high school. After we graduated, we got together for a while, but she left me for another man.","Where I came from in the country, there was no place to hear pop music like Little Richard and people like that. Later, I heard James Brown, Otis Redding, The Drifters, The Four Aces, The Ink Spots.","I never knew much about business. But I've been made happy. The TV and commercials have been very fortunate for me and my career. And Atlantic Records has always been wonderful to me. I don't think I could have chosen a better record company.","Most singers have their idols. I remember Elvis Presley when I was a kid. When I was about sixteen, I always said I wanted to do 'Love Me Tender.'","I had the great opportunity to work with some of the greatest artists - the Beach Boys, the Temptations, the Four Tops. Otis Redding. Wilson Pickett. Stevie Wonder. So many great singers. And don't forget Clarence Carter!","Every time I went into the studio, I always sung with my heart. If it came out as strong, as good, as powerful as that to my fans, then I was satisfied. I never slacked. I always did all the songs the same way as the first.","I keep my feet on the ground because of my roots and the way I was raised."],"Peri Gilpin":["Years ago, I did an interview about my mother for a publication called 'Info' magazine, and during that interview I told the reporter about my mother's leiomyosarcoma. She had had a hysterectomy, but at the time of it, the doctors didn't even think to look for sarcoma.","Everyone needs all the awareness of sarcoma they can get. Twelve thousand people get diagnosed a year. That's too many. One percent of cancers are sarcomas, and about 15% of pediatric cancers are sarcomas.","I never thought I'd do comedy, ever, in a million years. I always thought comedy was just for fun - to me, the real stuff was the real dramatic stuff. Now I know it's all valuable. There's a real excitement, a good feeling when you can make people laugh.","I miss the summer nights in Dallas.","The whole Hollywood nightlife thing cracks me up. I can't work and do that stuff.","Performing has been part of my life since I was eight years old, so that's what I think I do. I don't think about the fact that it happens to be in a bigger venue where people get to know you, or they think they do."],"Periander":["Practice is everything. This is often misquoted as Practice makes perfect.","Be moderate in prosperity, prudent in adversity."],"Perianne Boring":["Grief has similar side effects of alcohol consumption, such as numbness, guilt, and depression, resulting in less alert and price-sensitive customers. In addition, the funeral industry is somewhat taboo in the sense that communities in general don't communicate with one another about what are acceptable practices in this industry.","Applying criminal law to the exchange of bitcoin on behalf of ransomware victims would create a morally shocking result of re-victimizing a victim. All lawfully operating digital currency exchanges would thereafter refuse to exchange bitcoin for ransomware victims for fear of criminal culpability.","Blockchain technology has such a wide range of transformational use cases, from recreating the plumbing of Wall Street to creating financial sovereignty in the farthest regions of the world.","Blockchain startups are suffering from a crippling, archaic, and antiquated state regulatory system - and it's driving innovation abroad. Many blockchain start-ups trigger or may trigger money transmitter laws and regulations.","With Bitcoin, every transaction is publicly verified, so many risks are eliminated, including chargeback fraud or 'friendly fraud.' This is when a customer purchases something online with a credit card; waits to receive the goods or service, then requests a chargeback refund. The bank then forcibly takes the funds out of the merchant's account.","Exchanging bitcoin on behalf of ransomware victims should not be construed as criminal activity by the exchanger, not as a matter of law nor as sound policy. Such an interpretation would set a precedent that would surely cause real harm to the public, to the blockchain ecosystem, and to the financial services industry as a whole.","FinCEN directs financial institutions to file suspicious activity reports (SARs) to inform law enforcement of certain types of cyber-enabled crime. As the agency charged with protecting the United States from financial crime, FinCEN's guidance does not deem financial institutions who process such transactions to be involved in a criminal activity.","The law provides a remedy, charging those who threaten a victim's data for the purpose of extortion. Extending criminal liability to innocent third-party digital currency exchangers, or any other third-party financial institution, would be an utterly unwarranted and unjust misinterpretation both of law and policy.","The key benefits of a Special Purpose National Bank Charter are uniform regulations, standards, supervision, and authority for emerging financial technology companies to operate nationwide.","In March 2013, FinCEN issued guidance for virtual currency businesses - giving the industry some degree of clarity about how to be compliant on the federal level.","The blockchain industry generally agrees that some kind of a national license or charter is the best way to go, similar to the United Kingdom, where there is only one central regulator.","In the US, banking and finance are regulated on the federal and state level, there are multiple federal bank regulators, and there are separate securities and commodities regulators.","I have the great privilege and honor of serving as the Founder and President of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, the world's largest trade association representing the blockchain industry.","I hold no economic interest in any company in this industry; however, I do hold and use digital currency for my personal use. I strive to keep myself non-biased and work with the highest integrity.","If you are not an accredited investor, you only have one option: to buy and hold bitcoin on your own. The process of acquiring bitcoin is risky and requires a lot of due diligence to navigate the landscape properly.","Investors need to understand the risk of individual exchanges before trusting their funds with them.","Daniel Masters is a master of the commodities markets with over 30 years experience. His bitcoin strategy is based on the parallels he sees from the oil industry in 1999 to the current state of bitcoin.","BitPay is the leading payment processor for bitcoin. The company specialize in setting up merchant accounts to accept bitcoin payments.","The majority of companies using BitPay to accept bitcoin are small businesses that are benefitting from lower transaction fees, faster service, and increased security for fraudulent transactions.","Sir Richard Branson started out as a small business owner and now owns a conglomerate that will give you a ride to the moon. If you pay for your ride with bitcoin, you'll be using the first truly universal currency!","Bitcore was introduced to give a trusted platform to spur further bitcoin innovation, allowing BitPay to focus on what they do best: acquire merchants.","Digital assets, including bitcoin, could save small businesses substantial transaction fees and provide an added layer of security to their payment processing.","Businesses which were slow to recognize the power of the Internet in the mid '90s were quickly left behind. For example, Blockbuster failed to innovate with streaming technology and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2010.","The credit/debit card transaction system is antiquated, expensive, and inefficient. There are over nine steps to complete a transaction from the time a customer swipes their card to payment processing, settlement, and when the merchant finally gets paid. Every step along the way costs both the consumer and the vendor in additional fees.","A new product, technology, or innovation - such as Bitcoin - has the potential to give rise both to frauds and high-risk investment opportunities. Potential investors can be easily enticed with the promise of high returns in a new investment space and also may be less skeptical when assessing something novel, new, and cutting-edge.","Bitcoin has been described as a decentralized, peer-to-peer virtual currency that is used like money - it can be exchanged for traditional currencies such as the U.S. dollar or used to purchase goods or services, usually online. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin operates without central authority or banks and is not backed by any government.","There is no such thing as guaranteed high investment returns. Be wary of anyone who promises that you will receive a high rate of return on your investment with little or no risk.","An unsolicited sales pitch may be part of a fraudulent investment scheme. Exercise extreme caution if you receive an unsolicited communication - meaning you didn't ask for it and don't know the sender - about an investment opportunity.","Death is a dying industry with an economic phenomenon.","Many communities have turned a blind eye to what goes on inside funeral homes, as many people prefer not to know the ins and outs of the business. In addition, grieving customers in need of funeral goods and services may not be in a healthy state of mind to make financial decisions.","After Jessica Mitford published 'The American Way of Death' in 1963, to expose the abuses in the funeral industry, a groundswell of support for government intervention followed. Under President Ronald Reagan The Funeral Rule was first enacted to protect consumers from deceptive practices, but the rule has yet to put the nail in the coffin.","The IRS issued guidance for virtual currencies on March 25, 2014 that stated virtual currencies, including Bitcoin, are to be treated as property for federal tax purposes. This requires capital gains on virtual currencies to be recorded and reported. The Bitcoin Foundation says this could lead to unrealistic reporting.","Sometimes our greatest strengths are also our greatest weaknesses.","Through decentralized cryptography, Bitcoin eliminates the need for banking intermediaries, significantly lowering transaction costs, and could liberate poverty-stricken economies around the globe by providing access to capital to the one-third of humanity that is excluded from the financial world.","When you take a look at how the IRS treats foreign currency, bitcoin doesn't have the same taxation regime. Foreign currency gains and losses generally are taxed as ordinary income.","Bitcoin was created with security in mind. The Blockchain is Bitcoin's public ledger that records every transaction in the Bitcoin economy.","The Cyprus Financial Crisis was a devastating blow to Cypriots and halted their banking system. Banks closed for two weeks to prevent a banking panic. When they reopened, capital controls were placed on the people's money, and customers were met by armed guards at the branches."],"Pericles":["What you leave behind is not what is engraved in stone monuments, but what is woven into the lives of others.","Having knowledge but lacking the power to express it clearly is no better than never having any ideas at all.","Just because you do not take an interest in politics doesn't mean politics won't take an interest in you.","The whole earth is the tomb of heroic men and their story is not given only on stone over their clay but abides everywhere without visible symbol woven into the stuff of other mens lives.","We regard wealth as something to be properly used, rather than as something to boast about. As for poverty, no one need be ashamed to admit it: the real shame is in not taking practical measures to escape from it.","A woman's greatest glory is to be little talked about by men, whether for good or ill.","All who have taken it upon themselves to rule over others have incurred hatred and unpopularity for a time; but if one has a great aim to pursue, this burden of envy must be accepted, and it is wise to accept it.","Fishes live in the sea, as men do on land: the great ones eat up the little ones.","Freedom is the sure possession of those alone who have the courage to defend it.","The bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them, glory and danger alike, and yet notwithstanding go out to meet it.","Time is the wisest counselor of all.","It is right to endure with resignation what the gods send, and to face one's enemies with courage.","For famous men have the whole earth as their memorial.","Time is the king of all men, he is their parent and their grave, and gives them what he will and not what they crave.","We do not imitate, but are a model to others.","Your empire is now like a tyranny: it may have been wrong to take it; it is certainly dangerous to let it go.","Our love of what is beautiful does not lead to extravagance; our love of the things of the mind does not make us soft.","Trees, though they are cut and loped, grow up again quickly, but if men are destroyed, it is not easy to get them again.","It is more of a disgrace to be robbed of what one has than to fail in some new undertaking.","Those who are politically apathetic can only survive if they are supported by people who are capable of taking action."],"Perrey Reeves":["I don't know if you've ever knit a sweater, but by the end of it, you're like, 'Ugh I can't wear this.

Gucci is a go-to for her because every season there is something fun, but there's also something classic.","When you're in nature, when you're going to bed when the sun goes down and getting up when the sun rises, and you get into that rhythm, your body just really responds positively to it.","The Sanctuary at Two Rivers offers a much needed escape or retreat from the fast paced, modern lifestyle we have all become accustomed to, with its exquisite beauty, serenity, and raw nature. Costa Rica was the perfect place for developing such an important project."],"Perry Chen":["For most of the people who have a lot of success, it's because they were the ones who didn't quit. It's not necessarily because it was just laid out for them. It won't apply to all cases, but I think it's pretty good advice.","The kind of system Kickstarter uses has been used for hundreds of years. Unlike Medici-style patronage, where the richest people in town give large amounts of money, Kickstarter's system relies on the general public for funding projects, and rewards those backers.","Kickstarter was already up and going when I got the Fellowship. Spending time with the other Fellows was about camaraderie, and I talked to a lot of amazing and creative people.","I don't consider myself a social entrepreneur, but I'm thrilled to be doing good, if that's what I'm doing.","I remember early on, in the first couple of years especially, I would run into some people that would try to put Kickstarter under the 'social good' label. And I actually had this very visceral reaction - I just didn't like that at all.","Kickstarter has been such a heads-down thing.","I'm born and raised in New York. I've lived between New York and New Orleans for the last 16 to 17 years.","I wonder if people really know what the definition of crowd-funding is. Or, if there's even an agreed upon definition of what it is.","We'd love it if everybody had a Kickstarter project. I believe that everyone has some kind of creative project that they think about - whether it's something small they'd like to do over a weekend with friends, or it's the film they've always wanted to make, whatever.","Video is so primal.

I just breathe and sometimes it doesn't look as if I'm doing that.","Actually, I would love to make a music video. Maybe it would finally put to rest those persistent rumours that have followed me throughout my career - particularly when I was on camera performing - that I had died.","Although I managed my schedule to be home by late afternoon most days, basically, Roselle raised our children alone. And so I missed out on a lot of wonderful moments, missed watching my kids grow into the wonderful people they are today.","But today, I feel the genuine warmth, the affection, and although I may joke about it, I am touched.","But when they needed love or help or had a problem of any kind, they could always go to Roselle because she was always there for them. That was not always the case with me.","I worked with the world's greatest talents and then went home to the world's greatest woman. It was, and is, a great life.","In many ways, that affection is the real reward for 56 years in the business. Although the money ain't exactly bad either.","My only regret in life is that I didn't spend as much time with my kids as I now wish I had.","That I can't relate to today's music or morals doesn't make either necessarily bad.

Naked, more honest somehow. No glamor, just bald old me. I seldom wore wigs or hats. But some people must have thought I was an exhibitionist or a religious fanatic.","If I send out positive messages, it will set a chain of healthy thought processes.","We are all part of the same energy that envelops.","Basically, they had asked me if I would shave my head or wear a bald cap. I said look, if you are doing a series for five years I would want to shave my hair because I would go bald with all the gum and glue from the bald cap.","I was thrilled, because I like the big screen and I could then move on to the next thing. It was the biggest break for me. In a way, though, I wish it had been a TV series because then you are working for five years.","I also had this artist friend who'd paint butterflies and things like that on my head.","Creative people are very insecure people because they don't know whether people like them or are in awe of them. That insecurity always comes out. It makes them a better actor, I feel.","I mean, every Star Trek episode you saw was just phenomenal.","Gene Roddenberry was a genius.","I arrived in Hollywood and lived much of my life in America, but the fans did not really know me.","I only went to one Star Trek convention and that was in the late '80s. I hadn't gone to a convention before that. It was quite amusing, with the people dressed up and all of that.","One thing about me, as far as my career is concerned, is that I'm very confident. I know I'm good.","After Star Trek, I was with the top agencies, but producers and directors did not know what to do with me.","Everybody told me to stay in Hollywood. This was the place they said I could have a big career. What they failed to mention was that no one would quite know what to do with me.","If there is an exotic woman it's always a terrorist role.","I'm going down in history with Star Trek. It's a great feeling.","Every star, whether it's Harrison Ford or Robert De Niro, is remembered by one film. Persis is a star in the sky - how can a star be forgotten when all you have to do is look up and see her?","I know that nobody can become a star without a team.","I love what I do, and I'm not doing anything either for money or for the sake of some unfulfilled ambition.","I was brought to Hollywood by Gene Roddenberry and Michael Eisner, chosen from 600 hopefuls to star in the original 'Star Trek' motion picture. The success of the film, coupled with the allure that I had shaved my head for the role, put a spotlight on me.","I had a growing career as a model and an actress in London - I had starred opposite Michael Caine and Sidney Poitier in 'The Wilby Conspiracy' - but everyone told me to stay in Hollywood. This was the place, they said, and I could have a big career. What they failed to mention was that no one would quite know what to do with me.","I love America. I eagerly became a citizen. I have no bitterness toward those casting directors who dismissed me because of my accent, nor toward the producers and directors who wanted to cast me but thought the audience wouldn't accept my accent. I think they're selling their audience short.","It's tough to make it as an actor, tougher still to make it as an actress - the Screen Actors Guild is eager to provide the statistics to verify the latter."],"Persius":["He conquers who endures.","We consume our tomorrows fretting about our yesterdays.","Each man has his own desires; all do not possess the same inclinations.","Out of nothing can come, and nothing can become nothing.","Tomorrow is the day when idlers work, and fools reform, and mortal men lay hold on heaven.","Oh, what a void there is in things.","Is any man free except the one who can pass his life as he pleases?","And don't consult anyone's opinions but your own."],"Pervez Musharraf":["Islam teaches tolerance, not hatred; universal brotherhood, not enmity; peace, and not violence.","There is nothing wrong with intellectual differences flowing from freedom of thought as long as such differences remain confined to intellectual debates.","We claim Islam as Deen or a complete way of life.","Remember that mindsets can not be changed through force and coercion. No idea can ever be forcibly thrust upon any one.","I am not at all a politician. I don't think I'm cut out for politics. I am certainly not going to stand for election.","Was Islam spread by them through force and coercion? No. They preached Islam by personal example.","Who has suffered? The families of the dead, no doubt. But a greater loss was inflicted on Pakistan because, as I said, we lost the pillars of our society."],"Peta Todd":["I'm not a girlie girl at all.","Cervical cancer doesn't discriminate by how much money you have. The disease affects so many - it's frightening.","It's emotional to be leaving 'Page Three.' It's been my life since I was 18, and I'm so grateful for the chances it gave me.","I hope I helped change people's preconceptions about 'Page 3' girls by appearing on Newsnight and at the Oxford Union debate.","Hero Ride gives everyone the opportunity to get involved with an incredible charity, and the beauty of this challenge is that you can set the boundaries: whether you can manage 10 miles or 100 miles on the ride to Blackheath, Hero Ride is for everyone.","I've been supporting Help for Heroes for many years - I actually rode in their first-ever official fundraiser back in 2008. I have witnessed the great work that Help for Heroes do to support those who have suffered life-changing injuries and illnesses, and I want to do all I can to help raise as much as possible."],"Peta Wilson":["I'm crazy about my father, he's an amazing man, a real adventurer. He took us with him to travel all over the world. We were in places that were so remote, that white people hardly ever reach them.","If you're going to be sexy in a photo, you'd better be thinking about sex rather than about being sexy.","I never say no.","I'm actually quite conservative.","I've made a lot of grown men cry with laughter, because I really am quite the joke.","I'm the Magoo of actresses, very accident-prone.","I was scared of the dark. Ohhhh, I'd do anything not to have to sleep on my own. I'd get in bed and cover myself with dolls and teddy bears.","I personally prefer being a blonde, but whatever it takes for the character.","You can shave my head if you need to; it doesn't bother me.","I don't buy fur coats or jewelry. I have old cars."],"Pete Best":["Many things have been said about what happened, but I don't know either. Maybe someday. One thing I'm sure of is that all the things that have happened to me, good and bad, happy and sad, have made me what I am today.","I was close to John simply because I liked him as a person. He liked me as a person. We spent a lot of times at one another's houses back in Liverpool. We spent a lot of time together in Germany.","I walked out of the show business in 1968 because I thought that would be good for the family. It took me some time to decide but I wanted to spend more time with my wife and two daughters who were always beside me. I wanted to do everything I could for them.","We were at our best when we were playing in the dance halls of Liverpool and Hamburg. The world never saw that.","Liverpool was an industrial town, a poor town. The people fought hard for what they wanted to achieve and there was a hunger there, and that hunger has remained with the musicians.","Anyone who knows the history of the Pete Best Band or the Combo, we were on the verge of breaking in in America. In the mid-'60s, I had great songwriters; we wrote some great stuff.","When I came back into show business in '88 after spending 20-odd years in the civil service, it wasn't planned."],"Pete Burns":["I'm not really the sort to reflect or look forward. I prefer concentrating on the now.","I'm not trying to be a girl by putting on a dress - gender is separated by fabric.","It's not a matter of vanity; it's a matter of sanity. I'll never look forever young, but I'll look as best as I possibly can; I'll look surreal.","There was one point where my mother was dying of lung cancer, and a journalist dressed up as a nurse and got in the house to get a picture of her, dying of lung cancer and stuff like that, and then you realise the fame's not all it's cracked up to be.","The trouble is that people are all too ready to jump to conclusions about anybody who they think looks a bit strange. They think you must be mentally subnormal.","The amount of surgeries I've had are absolutely minimal compared to the reconstructive surgeries I've had. Probably 300.","From a child, I knew I didn't have the face I wanted to have. My mother was a baroness. She was from Berlin; she was a silent movie actress and friends with Marlene Dietrich. So she knew all about film make-up and prosthetics and stuff like that and what they used to do in those days. And she taught me all that as a child.","I have regular peels and Botox. It's something I'll always do. People redecorate their homes every few years, and I see this as no different. Changing my face is like buying a new sofa.","I had piercings all over my face, which did look dreadful, but I got them done while waiting for my husband Michael to get a tattoo. I was bored.","I'm not a camp, throwaway queen; I'm not in Neverland. I'm not Jennifer Lopez with three people to pluck my eyebrows. I've made myself what I want to be - not everybody's cup of tea. And people wanna have a look at me. I fully accept that. People have always wanted to have a look at me.","I hope when I'm 80 that I get to Heaven and God doesn't recognise me.","It was a lovely feeling, dying. I can remember being in the hospital, all wired up to tubes and thinking, 'If only you'd take these tubes out, it feels so nice.' It felt so - it felt like being in a bath of velvet. It was such a nice feeling. Everything felt so soft and floppy, and I wanted to go.","I don't wanna look like a 65-year-old geezer, you know, and I can't really see it happening.","I never have crushes, apart from my husband Michael, I guess, because I was obsessed with him, and I didn't speak to him for nearly a year. I kept going into the restaurant where he worked to look at him.","I never had posters on my walls, and I didn't have any icons, either. I come from a small village in Wirral, and my family didn't watch TV. I wasn't exposed to people with icon status. David Bowie popped up, but I had already shaved my eyebrows off by the time I saw his.","I've never had my heart broken.","If people don't think I can fall into what the norm is, that's their problem and not mine. I'm not the norm; I'm not deluded.","What I'm trying to achieve with my surgery is my own personal satisfaction. It's narcissism.","Surely, marriage is throwing anchor and saying, 'This is where I'm staying. I've made my choice, and this is all I want because I've been on the up and down escalator, through the revolving door, and I want to stand still.' That's what I expected.","I view marriage as a sacred institution. I think two men naturally are predators. Gay relationships are a commercial break, not a whole movie.","I'm not interested in gigs unless I really want to do them. I walked away from music in 1997, and then there was a greatest hits in 2002. Thank God, it didn't do too well because the record company wouldn't promote it.","What a lot of people don't realise about me is that I have no idea what's going on in the media. I don't pay any attention to it, as I consider it mind pollution. The last time I touched a computer was in 2001, and my phone is too old to use the Internet. I just don't enter into it at all on any level.","The idea of travelling all over the world singing the same songs sounds like hell. How people like Tina Turner still do it with enthusiasm is beyond me.","How did I write 'Spin Me?' I listened to Luther Vandross's 'I Wanted Your Love.'","In 1997, a severe depression hit me, but I didn't respond well to anti-depressants.","There's not a part of me, apart from the soles of my feet, which has not had work done.","I live a quiet daytime life. I walk everywhere. I lie down. I wash socks. I fry an egg.","My behavioural problems are non-existent because all my freakiness, I guess, is manifested in a visual way. And I never have come unravelled.","I fight for the right to be an individual. I have to be meself.","On reflection, I think the 1980s were a dreadful, abysmal time.","You shouldn't inflict yourself on the public when your fifteen minutes is up.","Over the years, I've had to learn how to deal with people who refuse to take me seriously. That's where I learnt the blunt side of my character.","I was brought up with an incredible amount of freedom and creativity.","I never wanted credit for being a wonderful person or a great human being or looking peculiar. I just wanted credit for the music.","You'd never catch me dead in a pair of fishnets! For one thing, they are not practical. And for another thing, it's just like a tacky drag queen.","I collect items like Elvis Presley clock radios and '50s memorabilia. It inspires a lot of my imagery. I like tasteful trash."],"Pete Carroll":["Each person holds so much power within themselves that needs to be let out. Sometimes they just need a little nudge, a little direction, a little support, a little coaching, and the greatest things can happen.","It isn't about the words you say. It's about the energetic message you send.","Once you're a football player, you're a football player for life. You always think of yourself in terms of that. We all do. It's hard to get rid of when you can't play anymore.","The thing that always strikes me is how much power one person has. Everybody has so much power to help and to change if they just exercise it and get after it.","Think of your favorite teacher you ever had in school: the one who made it the most fun to go to class. They surprise you. They keep you guessing. They keep you coming back, wanting to know what's going to happen next.","People make mistakes all the time. We learn and grow. If there's patience and love, and you care for people, you can work them through it, and they can find their greatest heights.","Dancers work and they work and they work, and they master their skills so far that improvisation just comes flowing out of them. Their natural expression of the best they can possibly be comes out of them because there is no boundary to hold them back... That's the mentality that I'm trying to create, recreate and hold on to forever.","My mom was really cool. She's the one that gave me the mentality about believing in myself and trusting it, that I was always gonna be okay, and that I could do things in a special way. She just pumped me up, you know?","I was the best guy, you know, all through Little League and Pop Warner and that kind of stuff. But when I went to high school, I was undersized. I didn't grow. I was behind the whole puberty cycle. I didn't like high school.","I am an example of a person who got zeroed into a philosophy early.","At the highest level in the NFL, the pass game is as complex as you can imagine.","In 1999, I got fired as coach of New England. In three years in New England, we actually did better than most people think. We were 27-21, won the AFC division title, went to the playoffs twice."],"Pete Cashmore":["Execution really shapes whether your company takes off or not.","I'm very much a creative person, but you've got to do the follow-through. A lot of people start out with an exciting thing and they want to take over the world, but really the people who do take over the world have a good plan of how to get there and the steps along the way.","The Internet was appealing partly because it was something I could do in bed and feel like I was achieving something. I had an operation when I was 13 and ended up with complications, so I was in and out of the hospital. The bottom line is you can get through health challenges. It's part of why I was so driven.","I don't have a TV or watch movies. I don't like to be broadcast to, I want to participate.","If it doesn't come through the Internet, it's not really compelling to me.","I kept my age quiet for a good few years. I didn't see it as a positive. I worked remotely, so I just didn't tell people.","You just want to be judged against everyone fairly.","The talent that has to be learned is finding out what someone's passion is and setting them up to realize that. You don't get the best work from people if you're guiding them versus them guiding themselves.","My dad is good at sticking with stuff and he has a strong work ethic, which is imbued in me. Growing up, he would constantly ask what I was doing and was I achieving anything."],"Pete Conrad":["I fully expect that NASA will send me back to the moon as they treated Sen. Glenn, and if they don't do otherwise, why, then I'll have to do it myself.","Roger. Clear the tower. I got a pitch and a roll program, and this baby's really going.","In thinking back to when we had our big glitch, I remember seeing it get light outside the window. We were in the clouds; I'm pretty sure we got hit by lightning.","The flight was extremely normal... for the first 36 seconds then after that got very interesting.","I think the Space Shuttle is worth one billion dollars a launch. I think that it is worth two billion dollars for what it does. I think the Shuttle is worth it for the work it does.","I think we need to do a little more all-weather testing."],"Pete Coors":["I've always wanted to serve my country in some capacity.","We've got gays working there. If they can demonstrate long-term relationships, we make same-sex benefits available just as we do with common-law marriages. Gays are productive people. Some fly airplanes, some work in breweries.","I supported Bob Schaffer's three races for Congress. But we all had concerns about whether he could win statewide. Then my wife suggested that I get it.","I'm a little skeptical about using the Constitution this way, but I also believe marriage is between a man and a woman and that the courts shouldn't legislate this matter.","If it went on the ballot in Colorado, I would vote to lower the drinking age.","I don't want to get in a big, long discussion about right and wrong, but our company has been working on the issue of underage drinking and alcohol abuse for a long time. I've been outspoken about it.","The 21st Amendment gives the states the right to decide what the drinking ages should be and other aspects relative to alcoholic beverages, and I support that. As a United States senator, I want to weigh in - this is not my agenda."],"Pete Davidson":["Things that I feel really sad about, I talk about. That way, if it's funny, it doesn't hurt anymore.","I feel bad for kids growing up that, like, their favorite rapper is Lil Yachty.","There are people for everybody, and luckily, I found mine.","There have been a couple of times when kids that weren't nice to me in high school are like, 'Hey, man!' And I'm just like, 'Yeah. Thank you very much.'","I don't like going out. I'm more of a watch TV, hang out, Netflix kind of guy. I don't like leaving; I don't like talking to people. It gives me anxiety.","I bombed so much as a standup that messing up doesn't matter to me anymore. I kind of enjoy bombing sometimes - I try and make everybody hate me more. Like, once I know it's not going well, I can just have fun.","I have to do stand-up. I have to do something comedy-involved every day, or else I will lose my mind.","I really wish that I was, like, strong enough to not go online.","I feel like every time I tweet, I lose money.","I was the class clown in high school, but I always took it too far, so nobody liked me. I was annoying. Like, I would get a laugh and then keep going and keep going.","I get nervous all the time. The only time I'm not nervous is onstage, which is weird.","I'm the most awkward person in the world, but onstage, I'm completely fine. I could run around in a thong and not care.","'SNL' has changed my career because it gave it a platform to be seen. And I really feel like the Weekend Update desk is where I am given the opportunity to shine on that show.","I have no idea how to do sketches, believe it or not.","My jokes have definitely changed. 'SNL' has helped with that, because when you're on 'SNL,' you have to kind of pay attention to the news. I feel like my material has gotten smarter now.","I got rid of Twitter, and I got rid of Facebook.","When my dad died, I had to go to therapy.","You can't say whatever you want on network television.","I'm not the first person to say this, but communication at 'SNL' - I don't want to say it's not good, but unless you ask questions, you will not know what's going on.","I always wanted my stand-up to feel like not just a show, but like you're hanging out with someone for an hour. I like to just talk.","I started doing stand-up when I was 16, my junior year in high school. My two friends and I would sit at home watching stand-up. They kept saying I should try it, and so I did.","I don't let a lot of people know about my dad dying on 9/11. It's not a way to introduce yourself. So I never told anybody, and then I would do jokes about it... and I think people thought I was lying about it. Which would be crazy!"],"Pete Docter":["Work hard! In the end, passion and hard work beats out natural talent.","I think, in Japan, animation isn't relegated to being a genre unto itself. It's just a medium by which you can tell any number of stories, be it horror or action or adventure or drama or whatever, and we're trying to do that as well. Every film that you go see from Pixar, we're hoping is a little bit of a surprise.","I remember as a kid having a balloon and accidentally letting the string go and watching it just float off and into the sky until it disappeared. And there's something about that, even, that feels very much like what life is, you know, that it's fleeting, and it's temporal.","I made tons of films. I did animation for my friends' films. I animated scenes just for the fun of it. Most of my stuff was bad, but I had fun, and I tried everything I knew to get better.","When I was in middle school, I liked to make cartoons.","'Toy Story' we found, sorta by accident, because we didn't know what we were doing, the idea of being replaced by somebody. Everybody has that fear, or encounters this jealousy at some point.","It's weird - on almost every film I've worked on, the first sequence we storyboard ends up being the first sequence that goes into animation, and ends up being almost shot-for-shot the same.","In some ways, I feel like the strength of animation is in its simplicity and caricature, and in reduction. It's like an Al Hirschfeld caricature, where he'll use, like, three lines, and he'll capture the likeness of someone so strongly that it looks more like them than a photograph. I think animation has that same power of reduction.","When people go to the theater, they don't want to think 'I know exactly what I'm gonna get,' and then they get it and then they walk out. I think you want to walk in going 'I don't really know what this is about,' and have the fun of discovering it.","I like doing everything. That's why I came to Pixar, as opposed to Disney or any other studio - it's small. At the time I started, I was, like, the 10th person in the animation group, and we all had to do everything. That's the way I like it, keeping it fresh.","In a regular theatre, you'd be kind of moving your eye from one character 5 feet over to the right on the cut. In IMAX, suddenly that's like 20 feet. So I would love to do something. I think I would really want to take the massive screen into consideration so that it would be done properly.","'Monsters,' everybody has the thought of monsters in your closet as a kid, and more importantly, the idea of becoming a parent. We're always kind of looking for those emotional nuggets. They're always at the heart of the story.","Each one of the films get built up and strengthened and reinforced, and we're not afraid to rip stuff out and redo it until we feel it's worthy of the 'Pixar' name.","Walt Disney wasn't making films for kids. Neither were the Muppets. A lot of the great, really cool films, they weren't making them for kids.","I love to go to the airports and just put on, like, dark glasses, so nobody can tell I'm staring at them, and just draw people.","The way we work at Pixar is we write the script, but then we quickly move on into story reel, which is basically like a comic-book version of the film. And then we do our own dialogue and music and sound effects, all in an effort to be able to basically sit in the theater and watch the movie before we shoot it, essentially.","'In-between' is sort of - an animator does the key poses. He'll do extremes, you know, like a character reaching out for a glass of water and then another one of him drinking. And the in-betweener has to do all the drawings that goes between those two. You know it could be 12, 23 whatever in-betweens.","I loved 'Dumbo.' I watched Bugs Bunny time and again. The Muppets were big, too. All of those, they have this real, not darkness but poignancy, that's what makes it stick with you.","I wanted to make sure that 'Up' wasn't a 3D movie about a man who sails his house to South America. It's a movie about an old man who sails his house to South America that also happens to be in 3D. So the first thing is always the story."],"Pete Domenici":["Hurricane Katrina exposed the harsh reality that we have been skating on thin ice when it comes to this country's energy concentrations on the Gulf Coast.","There are growing concerns that oil companies are making too much in profits at the expense of consumers.","I have said democracy and freedom do not work too well if you are hungry, if you are starving.","As the Iraqi people better understand that Saddam Hussein and his regime are history, it is my hope that they will get behind the coalition effort to help them create a democratic government and rebuild their country.","Small business in America is booming. The job creator in America, small business, is absolutely moving ahead.","I submit that those who run the American military at the top, and those whose boots are on the ground and who run the machinery and equipment, are sending a signal: You asked us to do something. Give us some time and we will solve the problems and we will do it.","I expect an energy bill to increase and diversify supply and stabilize energy prices - not drive up energy costs in one part of the country to subsidize energy in another region.","Instead of begging OPEC to drop its oil prices, let's use American leadership and ingenuity to solve our own energy problems.","We don't want crimes committed in New Mexico falling through the cracks. This legislation ensures that there is no area of our state where crimes can be committed without consequence.","Obviously, overall infrastructure needs on the Southwest and Northern borders are mounting. We need a major push in Congress to remedy this.","There are going to be questions about what major oil companies are doing with all of the resources they're accumulating. They can't escape that.","Today's gasoline prices are taking a severe toll on Americans' pocketbooks. Consumers are anxious."],"Pete Earley":["Our health care system squanders money because it is designed to react to emergencies. Homeless shelters, hospital emergency rooms, jails, prisons - these are expensive and ineffective ways to intervene and there are people who clearly profit from this cycle of continued suffering.","Having been a journalist for thirty-nine years, I've developed a pretty thick skin.","Unfortunately, we force people to break the law in order to get any kind of mental health treatment.","People with mental illnesses are dying on our streets. More than 350,000 are in jails and prisons. Most are people whose only real crime is they got sick.","I think that some of the greatest muckrakers and some of the greatest investigative journalists of all time had strong feelings about civil rights. There is a role for the journalist-advocate. And as long as you play your cards on the table, I think that's a role that we should allow.","Mental illnesses are so frightening and there's so much ignorance about them that I think it comforts people to think, 'Oh, well, it happens to these people because they deserve it.'","Sometimes I feel the only way I can get a major publisher interested in mental illness is if I find a character who has bipolar disorder and is also a love-sick vampire attending an English school called Hogwarts. But I'm not giving up."],"Pete Fountain":["What we used to say was whoever had the bow tie got to lead the band. There was never any jealousy.","If I had grown up in any place but New Orleans, I don't think my career would have taken off. I wouldn't have heard the music that was around this town. There was so much going on when I was a kid.","I was improvising before I was reading music. I was just trying to play things on the clarinet by ear. I think my ear is one of my greatest assets.","You know, it's funny... when you're making money, people don't think you're playing jazz. Now when you're not making money, people think that you're a good jazz musician."],"Pete Gallego":["I'm confident in my strengths. I'm prepared to jump any hurdle.","Because fossil fuels are not only a finite resource but hazardous to the environment, it is imperative that we diversify the resources used in generating electricity.","The irony is that kids are treated equally when it comes to tests and standards and expectations but not treated equally when providing funds to meet those standards and expectations.","Our challenge is to stop people from driving drunk. Punishing them afterwards doesn't bring back the victim or make the family feel better. The idea is to stop the DWI before it happens.","A robust democracy requires active participation.","It's important we understand our system seeks justice and not revenge.","As the polarization in D.C. spreads, the people willing to come to the middle find less and less acceptance.","My family never took vacations; we never traveled together. We never did anything. My spring breaks were going home to help my dad at the restaurant.","In the old way of doing business, it was fine to disagree and then go to dinner. Now it's personal and more partisan, and a disagreement on one issue leads to a disagreement on another issue.","How do you defend inaction in the face of crisis? How is that defensible for anybody?","Sequestration will make it extremely challenging - and in many cases impossible - for employees to meet their mortgage payments, pay their healthcare expenses, plan for retirement, or help their children attend college. To be blunt, these families are at risk.","You want to empower people who think like you do.","There's no such thing as anybody who can't be beat; everybody can be beat. It's a question of how hard you're willing to work. It's a question of the environment, the surroundings. Frankly, there's a lot of issues with timing.","PACs don't vote in the district; people do.","The luxury for me is that I've spent already several millions of dollars across the district getting people to know who I am... So, my name ID is really, really high.","If you want to come fight the good fight to make a difference for people and to try to get the government back on track, where we govern from the middle and not from the extremes, then understand that it's a lonely road, and you're going to have a hard time.","Frankly, no issue is worth shutting down the government and denying pay to those committed to public service.","I saw how hard my parents worked, and I didn't want to be a freeloader.","In Mexico, they don't have birth certificates... They don't have registration cards for voters. They have one national ID. We don't have a national ID.","Every decision I make in Congress will be centered on the needs of the district.","I didn't come to Washington to be part of the problem.","It was in the best interests of Zavala and other counties that we move forward with a farm bill and provide certainty to ranchers, farmers, food banks, and other providers.","I learned long ago you run unopposed, or you run scared.","I think it becomes incumbent upon a candidate to essentially disavow some of the things that are in that party platform. Otherwise, I think the assumption is that you are a true believer.","The fact that I am Latino is not a secret. There's not much I can do about that. It is what it is. I think people know that my last name ends in a vowel. What can I tell you?","Our voting records are not necessarily the same, but, you know, we're all Texans, and at the end of the day, we try to help each other out.","HB 2 leaves 90% of the children behind. The disconnect between this bill and the basic needs of Texas schoolchildren is appalling.","I told the president 'no' to special treatment for Congress when he tried to exempt them from Obamacare.","Obama's very unpopular. I don't need a poll to tell me that.","We've made our living for a long time on commerce and trade at the border.","If immigration reform doesn't happen, that doesn't say good things about our democracy, that everybody wants it, but Congress couldn't pass it.","There's this fight for the heart and soul of the Republican Party, and until that fight gets settled - because they're the majority - there's a lot of things that are pretty much on hold.","It's always bothersome when California does something better than Texas.","California - with more cars, more drivers and more people - still has less DWI-related deaths than Texas does.","This is pool. This is setting up your next shot, and I always want to make sure when we're setting up San Antonio's next shot we have a good shot at making sure that we continue to build our infrastructure in such a way that San Antonio will be a player for years to come in national defense issues.","When Congress puts party labels aside, like we did on VA reform, we can accomplish some great things for the American people. But those occasions were far too rare.","Here's the thing about Texas - and the thing about the border. We all know undocumented immigrants. They sit in our churches, are friends with our children, and work all around us. They are just like us.","My grandmother was not a U.S. citizen. Growing up along the border, you see the real human side of immigration - not the picture often drawn by politicians far removed from the border.","The policy of the future cannot forever be determined by the politics of the past - or even the present.","The men and women at our borders, given adequate resources, are doing an excellent job of keeping us safe.","I was impressed by the capability and talent and intellect of our troops on the ground. These kids are really impressive.","Around here, manana seems to be the busiest day of the week. We never seem to get there.","When the law says you're entitled to an attorney, it doesn't mean you're entitled to an attorney who sleeps or an attorney who doesn't do his job.","A lawmaker cannot be pro-sequester while also purporting to be pro-national security or supportive of a strong economy.","We must work for a solution to address the senseless cuts that hurt our border, our economy, and our country.","No one will steal my son's American Dream.","I have never been in favor of gay marriage, and I am not in favor of gay marriage.","Congress is more broken than ever. Congressman Will Hurd has quickly become part of the problem.","I think 'immigration' is a bad word for many Republicans.","We have a two-party system that I think can work well if people make an effort.","It's just so unfortunate that, as we get adjusted to this global economy, that the U.S. is even thinking about building walls.","I think the post-Rick-Perry Texas is a Texas that is more competitive between the Democrats and Republicans. I think the Republicans still have a huge advantage, but I think if we're arguing that competition is good for the system, then I think a stronger two-party system in Texas is inevitable, and I think that it will happen.","As an incumbent, if you are winning, your commercials are about motherhood and apple pie and the flag.","We all want our border to be secure. However, certain individuals use this argument to stop us from ever enacting immigration reform.","It takes a certain personality to thrive as a member of the House.","People don't have the opportunity to be larger than life anymore - they're afraid of seeing it on the Internet.","I like having a battleground district because I think that's real-life America.","In the district I represent, I have to talk to everybody.","I don't have the luxury of just hanging out in my primary and, once I win the primary, I'm fine. I have to talk to Democrats and Republicans.","It's tremendously undemocratic in a democratic society when you deliberately disenfranchise thousands of people.","Turnout is good for the system.","For me, the issue is if I'm your advocate, if I'm your representative, my job is to stand up for you and talk about you and defend you.","One of the things that ties people together, whether they live in a rural or urban area, is the really big number of people who have served in the military. Veterans issues are very important in the district.","It's a lack of respect for the community when you're not willing to debate because it's the 'wrong' network.","One of the things in my experience about changing parties: There are very few exceptions to the general rule. And the general rule has been, people are going to invite you into the church, but they are not going to make you a deacon."],"Pete Hamill":["The most successful terrorist group in the United States for almost 70 years was the Ku Klux Klan. They hated Catholics, Jews, and blacks. They were prone to violence.","If it's a beautiful day, I love taking walks. The walks are always aimless.","I don't ask for the meaning of the song of a bird or the rising of the sun on a misty morning. There they are, and they are beautiful.","The Anarchists set off World War I with a gunshot in Sarajevo - but they faded away. It wasn't that the police drove them out of business. The ideology had nowhere to go except into permanent negativity.","Viewers can't work or play while watching television; they can't read; they can't be out on the streets, falling in love with the wrong people, learning how to quarrel and compromise with other human beings. In short, they are asocial.","In the '70s, the newspaper guild managed to get people paid what they were worth, but the reporters suddenly became middle class. It's much more respectable, more uptight, and everyone speaks in guarded tones. And the writing isn't as good. We always had guys who were failed poets and failed novelists who did it to eat.","The replenishing thing that comes with a nap - you end up with two mornings in a day.","It's easy to be a tough guy when no one's going to come knocking on your door.","The Mafia exists in the American imagination because we want it to exist.","In 1962, I wrote a series about 42nd Street called 'Welcome to Lostville.' One result was that the young Bob Dylan read it and invited me to his first concert at Town Hall; the result was a kind of friendship that years later led to my liner notes for 'Blood on the Tracks.'","Vietnam should have taught us that nationalism, with its engines of independence and self-determination, is a more powerful force by far than Marxism and must be understood and respected.","There is a growing feeling that perhaps Texas is really another country, a place where the skies, the disasters, the diamonds, the politicians, the women, the fortunes, the football players and the murders are all bigger than anywhere else.","I always make a distinction between nostalgia and sentimentality. Nostalgia is genuine - you mourn things that actually happened.","Confession alone is not necessarily good for the soul.","What would Chaucer have written about if men were perfect?","Boxing is one of those leftovers from a more primitive past that should be finished off and killed. I don't love it anymore.","To me, doctors and nurses and teachers are heroes, doing often infinitely more difficult work than the more flamboyant kind of a hero.","Everybody needs an editor.","In the 1950s, when I was hanging around Sullivan's Gym and the Gramercy Gym, there were fixed fights. Mob guys like Frankie Carbo and Blinky Palermo had taken over the sport; one lightweight champion loaned his title to others at least twice; the welterweight division was a slag heap.","We're in an age when everything's present tense. People don't know how to be still and surrender to the music.","Nothing surprises me, particularly men and their propensity to be fools.","He steps on stage and draws the sword of rhetoric, and when he is through, someone is lying wounded and thousands of others are either angry or consoled.","Say what you will about him Ed Koch is still the best show in town.","It's odd being an American now. Most of us are peaceful, but here we are again, in our fifth major war of this century.","I've lived in other cities - Rome, Dublin, Mexico City - but I was born in New York City, and I always lived in those other places as a New Yorker.","I was the oldest of seven kids, so I had no older brother who would say, 'Schmuck, don't do that.'","When I was a kid, I could draw, and my ambition was to be a cartoonist. I wanted to draw comics. But I also liked newspaper comics.","Too many people take New York for granted. The primary reason is that history is not taught. That's outrageous in a city where the past is still visible.","I was born in 1935. But my mother and father - who were immigrants from Ireland - and everybody that I knew growing up in Brooklyn came out of the Depression, and they were remarkable people.","The Tammany guys, many of them were corrupt. They were still around when I was a boy. You knew the Tammany guys' name.","Bootleggers were romanticized by people like F. Scott Fitzgerald, for example. Gatsby is a bootlegger. And they were not thought of as evil criminals in the newspapers, either. There was a certain amount of affection for them.","My father lost his leg in 1927 playing soccer. A kick broke his leg; gangrene set in. They sawed it off. So he didn't get what a lot of Irish immigrants got, which was a job on the Waterfront - he didn't get that.","For me reading a book is what I like doing, curled up in a corner in a comfortable chair.","People become writers in the first place by those things that hurt you into art, as Yeats said it. Then they become separated from what started out affecting them. Journalism forces you to look at the world so you don't get cut off.","If you're the oldest in a large family, you tend to do everything yourself, particularly if you are the first American. You begin a habit or pattern that makes it easy to reject other help.","My father did shape me. He didn't drive because he had one leg, and for years I never drove. I had no mobility.","The odyssey is not going out and seeing the world: it's about trying to get home. It's home to the woman you love.","I couldn't have been the novelist I was without being the journalist I was.","My parents were Belfast Catholics.","When I was in the navy, I wanted to go to Paris and the Academie Julian. I never did. Mexico City took me instead.","I like to say that journalism is the graduate school from which you never graduate.","Writing is so entwined with my being that I can't imagine a life without it.","Usually, I work every day, seven days a week. When I go three days without writing, my body aches with anxiety; my mood is irritable. My night dreams grow wild with unconscious invention.","Ezra Pound was a crackpot on social and political issues, but he knew what he was talking about in matters of the written language.","Getting out any weekly magazine requires many hours of reading, choosing, discarding, and thinking beyond the obvious.","Every reporter inhales skepticism. You interview people, and they lie. You face public figures, diligently making notes or taping what is said, and they perform their interviews to fit a calculated script. The truth, alas, is always elusive.","The challenge remains a simple one: to write news that stays news.","I'm so concerned with morgues and libraries of the newspapers.","The Huffingtonpost.com does not pay its writers. Tina Brown's thedailybeast.com does pay its writers. You have to be paid because this is not a hobby. You have to keep that standard. You can't ask grandpa to loan you money because you have to go to Afghanistan. I walked the picket line for that to continue.","Everybody who went to Vietnam carries his or her own version of the war. Only 10 percent engaged in combat; the American elephant, pursuing the Vietnamese grasshopper, was extraordinarily heavy with logistical support.","Vietnam should have taught us that mindless anti-Communism is not a cause worth killing or dying for in a world in which Communism is hardly a monolithic force.","There's no one New York. There's multiple New Yorks.","Anybody who sits and says, 'I know New York' is from out of town.","In my experience, growing up in Brooklyn and all that, the real tough guys didn't act tough. They didn't talk tough. They were tough, you know? I think about these politicians who try to pose as tough guys - it makes me laugh.","Part of my head will always be in the years after World War II - the five years before Korea started.","The Irish fought the Italians until they started marrying them. And then they both fought the Jews until they started marrying them.","There are a lot of very good New York novels, but there's no single all-encompassing novel, the way you could look at any number of Dickens books and say we know London as a result of that.","I usually wake up at 7, 7:15, without an alarm. I hate the sound of an alarm.","One thing that I notice that is changing, you don't see kids on Sunday. Most of them are home. The kids are having much more virtual childhoods instead of childhoods. They don't play ball or hang out with the wrong people or get in fistfights, all the things that once made childhood. I don't know how it's going to turn out.","Any of us who've been newspapermen for a long time hate generalizations.","The spookiest thing I can remember about John Gotti is his eyes.","The original text of New York is all below Chambers Street.","There's nothing more human than selling food to strangers, you know?","Journalism is a team sport. Writing novels is golf: it's you and the ball.","Amazon.com isn't the same as going down an aisle. The same as record stores. You'll go for Billie Holiday, and you buy Gustav Mahler as you're going out the door.","You can't be a reporter using Google. It can be a tool. But you have to get out of the house.","The blogosphere might be very useful as propaganda or as therapy. But it's not journalism.","The Internet has got great tools. How we lived without Google all those years I don't know.","Sentimentality is a false sense of self.","One thing I learned working at the Brooklyn Navy Yard was to be on time. If the day begins at 8 A.M., be there early, get there, punch the time clock; don't just stand there like an oaf.","In the newspaper business, I was in the last generation before the arrival of the personnel manager. You were hired by editors - and editors who would take a chance on what they perceived to be talent and not hire a resume.","Travel at least erodes some of the narrowness that exists in each of us.","As a master of graphic creation, as teacher, historian, and roving ambassador of comics, Jerry Robinson has ensured that future generations of talented kids will continue to imagine and then put marks on paper.","Sinatra's endurance has become a rallying point for many people who feel that their sacrifices and hard work are no longer honored.","Mick Jagger's fans bought records with their allowances. Sinatra's people bought them out of wages.","Writers are rememberers.","Reporters now are better educated than the crowd I knew when I broke in. We still had guys shaped by Prohibition and the Depression, so the news business still had badly paid people who loved it for the life, because every day was different.","For years, the defenders of television have argued that the networks are only giving the people what they want. That might be true. But so is the Medellin cartel.","Leon Uris is a storyteller, in a direct line from those men who sat around fires in the days before history and made the tribe more human.","Across the years, in spite of everything I knew, my passion endured. Newspapers and magazines paid me to cover fights when I'd have paid my own way.","An independent Brooklyn probably would have built a new stadium for the Dodgers, so today there might be not just baseball but also the only football team on this side of the Hudson.","New York and Dublin are now suburbs of each other.","There are human beings who will be helped in understanding our times through the diaries of Edward Robb Ellis.","As a reporter, going around, you hear stories you can't prove, which means you can't put them in the newspaper. But they're good stories, and I would jot them down thinking maybe one day I could write that as a short story.","At the beginning of writing fiction, too much of the newspaper style was getting into the prose, so I thought, 'Gee, I should try writing longhand. Maybe I can tap something that goes back to the point before I could type.'","If you ask me, I think 12-step programs are perfectly valid, can be an enormous help. But it depends on the individual.","I don't think enough journalists read enough - literature, history. You've got to keep reading all through your career.","You've got to have something in your life you don't sell to others.","Gabriel Garcia Marquez was a newspaperman originally in Colombia. He talked about - and I agree - how everybody has a public life, a private life, and a secret life.","'The Daily News' and 'Post' gave me my life, and I want to see them survive.","There's no way that any tabloid can survive if it doesn't get women to read it.","I'm not interested in stories about movie stars. I couldn't care less what Steve Martin has on his mind.","Sinatra slowly found a way to allow tenderness into the performance while remaining manly. He perfected the role of the Tender Tough Guy and passed it on to several generations of Americans. Before him, that archetype did not exist in American popular culture.","All good sports reporters know that the best stories are in the loser's locker room.","Losers are more like the rest of us. They make mistakes they can't take back.","The most powerful force in American politics is not anger, it's nostalgia.","The background of any artist is shaped by the first 15 years of his or her life.","One of the first things that helped me to understand certain things about writing was seeing 'The Iceman Cometh' in the Village when I was a kid, before I ever became a newspaperman, and realizing that the world I knew could also be the subject of some amazing stuff.","For those without money, the road to that treasure house of the imagination begins at the public library.","I think if you had to choose between running a tabloid and being president of the United States, of course you'd run the tabloid, especially in New York.","New York is essentially a bazaar, not a Presbyterian church.","You can't edit yesterday's paper.","You will never have enough space in a tabloid paper to compete with the 'New York Times' on foreign coverage."],"Pete Hegseth":["Memorial Day isn't just about honoring veterans, its honoring those who lost their lives. Veterans had the fortune of coming home. For us, that's a reminder of when we come home we still have a responsibility to serve. It's a continuation of service that honors our country and those who fell defending it.","As an observer, I react to the realities of Israeli life with both envy and relief. Nobody wants to live under the threat of constant attack from enemies right next door, under ceaseless and often unfair international scrutiny, defending his homeland by day and living with the memories of mass genocide at night.","At Concerned Veterans for America, we've made the case that the defense budget could be targeted for spending reform, but in a targeted fashion that genuinely changes unsustainable spending trajectories while preserving U.S. defense capacity.","The choices Israelis face and the decisions they make, day in and day out, are literally the difference between life and death. In many ways, I liken their reactions to the way I felt while serving in Iraq.","As an infantry officer who served in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay, I have led men in combat and trained them on tactics and strategy. The mission of the infantry is to 'close with, and destroy, the enemy.' Our job, in a direct way, is to fight and win wars.","I think standing and fighting and working alongside all of these people that raise their right hand and serve their nation... really wipes away the distractions of some of the petty things we think are important at home.","Defense leaders should be searching for ways to reform out-of-date procurement processes, to collapse layers of Pentagon bureaucracy, and to restrain the growth in personnel and benefits costs. A critical first step in that process should be to conduct a full Pentagon audit to determine how DOD spends taxpayer dollars.","With the winding down of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States now has an opportunity to implement real defense reforms without having a serious impact on immediate battlefield needs.","Concerned Veterans for America (CVA) has called for an audit of the Pentagon, so that we finally have some transparency and accountability in how DOD spends taxpayer dollars.","The historic nature of Israel's struggle for self-determination, freedom, and prosperity underscores the gravity of their circumstances and fortifies my commitment to America's responsibility as their ally.","Military deployments have never been something to enjoy, but the consequence of the actions, the shared nature of the sacrifices, and the nobility of the cause are invigorating. To be clear, I'm not talking about the killing and the death; rather, the sense of purpose that pervades every action, reaction, and outcome.","When Mr. Obama entered office, he said all the right things about getting Washington spending under control. He even promised to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term. Obviously, that didn't happen.","Peace through strength works; but the flip side is war invited by weakness.","Veterans are driven by the same frustrations that the public has with what is happening in Washington... the fiscal irresponsibility and the financial crisis that our country is facing.","It's a sense in Minnesota that we need to get back to common sense. We need to get back to taking sensible looks at positions and understanding the proper role of government.","I believe, if done correctly, eliminating Saddam and liberating Iraq could be the 'Normandy Invasion' or 'fall of the Berlin Wall' of our generation... the Iraqi people are eager to be rid of Saddam, and there is equally encouraging evidence that republican principles could thrive there.","President Lincoln chose to fight a bloody and unpopular war because he believed the enemy had to be defeated. He was right.","As the publisher of the 'Tory,' I strive to defend the pillars of Western civilization against the distractions of diversity.","In the 360-degree battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, women have served honorably and fought valiantly. Yet there is a key difference between being in harm's way and reacting to enemy contact, and being in a direct combat operations role day in and day out. They are different scenarios that require different standards.","Combat duty is strenuous and physically demanding, and I'm not the first person to notice that men and women are built differently. And while many will argue that women will only be allowed into combat arms units under the same requirements as their male counterparts, count me as skeptical.","Whether we like it or not, gender differences matter in a combat situation.","Being a defense hawk and a budget hawk are not mutually exclusive.","Political correctness is a poison to our security and defenses. It imposes a willful blindness, both at the macro level when unwilling to engage with radical Islamism or whatever you want to call it - if you're not willing to call it what it is - and at the micro level, at the street level."],"Pete Hoekstra":["Hard work, years of sacrifice, and dedication are necessary to succeed in the real world. Snowden's most notable accomplishment was lying about his military service, his experience, and education to procure a job with the NSA in the first place.","Consumer accountability drives quality and efficiency.","Good governance requires working toward common ground. It isn't easy.","The anniversary of the tragic attacks on September 11, 2001, and September 11, 2012, is a day to remember those who died and suffered. It is also an opportunity to open a new dialogue on the tactics and strategies that have been successful - and unsuccessful - in confronting, containing, and defeating the threat from radical Islam.","Choices abound in the free market. Choice creates real and immediate accountability.","ISIS has stated that it intends to infiltrate the hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees fleeing the barbaric ISIS terrorists, using their families as cover.","The primary role of government is to provide for the safety and security of their populations.","Complying with requests from Congress is not optional. It is mandatory.","Accepting Syrian refugees into the United States is an emotional issue.","After the heavily politicized 2007 Iran NIE, many of us in Congress found it hard to take some intelligence analysis at face value.","ISIS filled the vacuum in Iraq and Syria created by a lack of effective governance.","Gadhafi was a monster who ruled his country for 42 years with an iron fist and became an international pariah as a result. However, he found religion once he recognized his perilous position when the U.S. adopted an uncompromising response to international terrorism following 9/11.","Asking presidential candidates whether they support or would change past foreign policy decisions is the most common line of questioning among members of the media. It's also the most pointless.","I'm not OK with clergy, students, and those of different opinions lying and expressing hateful speech in the name of love, but again, it is their constitutional right. I'm not OK with their conduct, but in America we tolerate it, as obnoxious and spiteful as it may be.","The unregulated migration of hundreds of thousands of refugees from terrorist safe havens in Syria, Iraq, and Libya has created a very difficult threat environment for Europe.","I've got a lot of respect for Mike Hayden.","The danger of having the military take over intelligence is that the military has a very different perspective on the world.","I think cleaning house at the CIA needed to happen.","Real leadership is leaders recognizing that they serve the people that they lead.","Libya is a huge disaster.","I'm not OK with clergy, students, and those of different opinions chanting and swearing, but it is their constitutional right.","Sports are trivial compared to matters of war and peace, but some parallels apply.","We can find common ground in agreeing that politics have no room in foreign policy.","We need to recognize the reality of the threat from radical Islam: that it will be an enduring conflict, that there are no easy decisions, and that mistakes have and will be made.","Just as sports teams recognize the potentially game-changing benefit of calling time-outs, failing to do so in matters of warfare is a surefire way to continue losing.","Illicit weapons have always been available to those who can afford them, but they have not generally been the latest state-of-the-art equipment, which requires experience and expertise to use.","The Islamic State has proven that terrorists can seize and deploy modern military equipment on lesser-armed opponents.","Islamic fundamentalists in dark areas of Libya rifled through leftover stockpiles of conventional, chemical, and biological munitions from Muammar Gaddafi's rule. Who knows where they are now?","The U.S. faces a very dangerous sprint by outlaws to gather the deadliest weapons and technology on the planet, something we always thought possible but hoped would never occur.","Succeeding against an army of strawmen might feel good as a speech, but in reality, the world is filled with extraordinarily difficult challenges and very real consequences as a result of how we face them.","The U.S. might have diminished al-Qaeda's capabilities in the border region of Pakistan and Afghanistan, but it has not diminished the threat from radical Islamist terrorists as a whole.","Obama's 'reset' with Russia and 'pivot' to Asia never materialized.","America, at its core, is a country of strong and resilient people who are prepared to confront the challenges posed by those who seek to do us harm.","Obama sought a strategy of accommodating our enemies, even if they weren't so willing to accommodate us.","The fact is that no foreign-policy doctrine is perfect.","An issue that really concerned me when I was on the House Intelligence Committee was the quality of analysis.","A real possibility exists that we will be forced to confront, contain, and ultimately defeat radicalism and al-Qaeda alone, or at least with far fewer allies in the region than we had before.","The Panetta/Petraeus combo is a powerful tandem. I've seen both of them up close and personal at the CIA and in Iraq.","The need to remove Col. Qaddafi should be self-evident.","A wounded Qaddafi still in power would be an ongoing threat and menace to the rest of the world.","America has historically met the challenges to its national security with decisive actions that defeated or, at a minimum, contained the threat.","It seems that whenever America faced a challenge, it faced it and overcame it.","Briefly after the 9/11 attacks, Republicans and Democrats were united in identifying the evil of the radical jihadists and fighting it.","The world has devolved into a much more hardened and lethal place since that devastating September morning when Islamists assassinated nearly 3,000 Americans in the worst terror attack on U.S. soil.","Both Presidents George Bush and Barack Obama pursued policies of regime change after 9/11 - with Bush removing al-Qaida's safe haven in Afghanistan and the sadistic anti-American dictator Saddam Hussein in Iraq - but Obama took it a step further and disregarded regional stability as a guiding factor for U.S. policy.","Islamists and their sympathizers hate us, and they will not stop hating us until we convert to ancient Islam. There is no middle ground or accommodation.","Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan harbor incredible promise for America once they forge an effective partnership.","The U.S. cannot survive another four years of the Barack Obama-Hillary Clinton regime.","Obamacare became the disaster that its detractors always said that it would become.","Not once during Obama's tenure did the country achieve an annual 3 percent rate of economic growth.","Boko Haram, by itself, has destroyed large areas in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, and Niger.","Where the West has intervened in African domestic affairs, such as it did in Libya 2011, the country became a cradle of extremism that exports weapons, jihadists, and ideology to the rest of Africa, the Middle East, and Europe.","The West needs leaders with the courage and the will to fight the scourge of radical Islam.","Libya became a rat's nest of extremism after NATO helped depose dictator Moammar Gadhafi, and it now exports weapons, jihadists, and ideology to Europe, Africa and the Middle East.","Western Europe has been redefining the nation state since 1945 when it formed the European Union following World War II.","Europe and the United States are better off extending a helping hand to those who know best rather than dictating to them an unfamiliar future.","World leaders need to approach the problems in the Middle East and northern Africa with imaginative ideas such as those that created the E.U.","The Eurozone allows for the largely unimpeded movement of people, goods, services, and capital across borders. It has also resulted in unprecedented cooperation on crime, security, and finance among its members.","Gadhafi opponents included many 'good guys,' but they never received the support necessary to govern a new Libya after he was gone.","Foreign policy is painstakingly difficult, and if there is to be anything gained from the experience in Libya, it is how not to conduct world affairs.","Radical jihadists hate Americans for who we are. They cannot be managed. They cannot be trusted. Engaging them is a tragic fool's errand. We need to realize that they are at war with us and that we cannot control their motivations. We instead need to confront them, contain them, and ultimately defeat them before they defeat us.","Clinton appears to be the sole holdout in the Obama administration in understanding the catastrophe caused by its foreign policy in Libya.","The policies and laws executed by the grand mufti in Libya, the long-term agenda in the short-lived Morsi government in Egypt, and by ISIS in its ideal Islamist Ummah are incompatible with the Constitution, period.","Choosing to arm and train the Islamist opposition against dictator Moammar Gadhafi unleashed its most ruthless terrorist elements.","Once the U.S. and NATO walked away from Libya, a chaotic, lawless state in the soft underbelly of Europe arose.","The overall feckless strategy against ISIS in Syria and Iraq enabled the Islamist organization to expand its domain and drive out more religious minorities.","America's bipartisan strategy for years has been to deny jihadists with sanctuaries anywhere in the world from where they can plan, prepare, and train for attacks against the West.","America needs a bipartisan foreign policy that is predictable, pragmatic, and understandable.","Former Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi and the radical Islamist mullahs ruling Iran share many similarities, but honesty and negotiating in good faith are not among them.","The Obama administration notoriously refuses to acknowledge that Islamists commit Islamist terror, so it logically follows that a Christian victim of Islamist violence should not address the issue lest it challenge accepted political orthodoxy.","The U.S. should prohibit perpetrators and supporters of Islamist brutality from entering the country while embracing advocates for religious freedom. End of story.","As a member and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee during the 2000s, I met with civilian and military officials in Kurdistan, Libya, Jordan, Israel, Egypt, and Yemen. They shared many of the same international defense priorities as the United States. We acknowledged our differences, but we worked from where we found common ground.","Belonging to the Gang of Eight carries massive responsibility in representing all 435 members of the legislature in very sensitive national security exercises.","Decisions concerning covert actions are not often easily reached.","Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, and Clinton passed legislation because they understood and appreciated the difficult political process. They fought for their principles yet recognized the need for compromise to get anything done.","House Speaker John Boehner and presumed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell understand the art of politics.","Nobody walks away with everything they want in politics.","The Kurds in Iraq just don't have enough military equipment - they also need humanitarian relief.","While the primary focus continues to be on religious minorities - the Christian religious minorities and the Jewish community - ISIS will also go after people who interpret and believe the Muslim faith differently than they do.","America is the freest country on the planet, but for Snowden, this isn't enough. He is a state diplomat in Snowden land.","There are no consequences for Snowden breaking the law in Snowden's World. It's where his massively inflated ego dictates the rules and determines which he will follow.","I served 10 years on the U.S. House Intelligence Committee, and I had the distinct privilege of meeting with real U.S. spies throughout the globe.","The silence caused by politicizing speech is deafening.","Nobody will ever agree with everything everyone says, especially once an issue or speaker becomes politically charged. But as tolerant and civilized Americans, we should at least have the decency to hear them out.","The answer as to why ISIS gained power and influence, and why stability in the Middle East has disastrously deteriorated, does not require extensive analysis.","The Obama-Clinton administration gambled with America's national security by embracing radical jihadists, and the world lost.","Libya stood as a source of stability in volatile northern Africa in 2011. The administration turned it into a failed state that exposed southern Europe to refugees and terrorist elements, all of which Gadhafi had warned about.","The forces that rescued Americans on Sept. 11, 2012, were not the U.S. military. They were not the militias that overthrew Gadhafi. They were Gadhafi devotees who were loyal to him and to the U.S. government with whom their leader reached a 'deal.'","The U.S. must remember - as the Gadhafi loyalists have and Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh are now realizing - that it cannot get into bed with groups affiliated with the jihadist movement.","Should President Clinton have killed Osama bin Laden when he had the opportunity in 1990s? Should President Bush have sent the U.S. military into Iraq to depose Saddam Hussein in 2003? Should President Obama have withdrawn all troops from Iraq in 2011? Such questions provide no real insight into future considerations.","The media should probe and challenge candidates to help voters understand their views on foreign policy. Questions should include, 'What lessons have you learned from past foreign policy decisions? How will they shape your vision as commander in chief? What is America's role in the world?'","No president can amend the past, and the public is tired of candidates who simply point fingers instead of offering their own solutions. They want a leader who will describe the threats as they are and rally the country behind a strategy to defeat them.","Yes, Gaddafi was a ruthless dictator and supporter of terrorism during his 40-year reign in Libya, but he had become an ally of the United States in the fight against radical jihadism after 9/11.","America needs to fully grasp the lessons learned from our history of fighting radical jihadists. There have been successes and failures.","Ensuring that the intelligence community adheres to its responsibilities to report on its activities to Congress is absolutely essential.","From my experience as Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, if a congressperson is identified as a potential target by a foreign intelligence service, that individual is notified.","When I came to Congress in 1993, the traditional idea that all politics stopped at the water's edge was alive and well. Americans had been unified for the previous four decades against the threat from the former Soviet Union and communism.","I will never forget standing with fellow members of Congress on the steps of the Capitol to sing 'God Bless America' on the night of 9/11.","Americans must step back and realize that an effective foreign policy is very difficult to devise, and we must present a united front to make it work.","Demanding an end to partisan bickering on foreign policy is not an unrealistic requirement.","Governing has always been hard.","Any customer of government - whether it's with education, taxes, housing, or health care - understands the frustrations when they have a bad experience. They're stuck and can't go anywhere else."],"Pete Laney":["'Reform' is pillage and plunder if you're against it, and it's good government if you're for it.","All you've got to do is go back and look in the early 1900s and see what we had in Texas without public education and realize what it has done for the state."],"Pete Maravich":["There is nothing wrong with dedication and goals, but if you focus on yourself, all the lights fade away and you become a fleeting moment in life.","I got by on talent. That was my fatal mistake.","When I arrived, I felt the spotlight shining brightly on me, and I knew the sharks were ready to strike if I did not pan out and prove myself to be the showman and the player the college ranks had labeled me to be.","My life had no meaning at all. I found only brief interludes of satisfaction. It was like my whole life had been about my whole basketball career.","Shooting is nothing. Anybody can shoot. The big charge is putting on a show for the crowd.","I don't want to play 10 years and then die of a heart attack when I'm 40.","They don't pay you a million dollars for two-hand chest passes.","It's hard when your father's the coach. Sometimes you don't know where one leaves off and the other begins.","I lived my life one way for 35 years, for me. And then the focus came in on what I really was.","Most of my career was negative.","I accomplished what I set out to do, but I lost my discipline and my career."],"Pete McCloskey":["Well, perhaps the greatest achievement, and we didn't know it at the time, was we held an Earth Day in 1970, and out of that Earth Day a lot of students got involved in saving the environment, or trying to.","We were environmentalists of the Teddy Roosevelt theory. We believed in separation of church and state. We believed in the independence of the Supreme Court not being subject to politicians.","The result was, when Congress convened in January 1971, everyone was now an environmentalist. They had seen a new force, college students, who favored the environment.","In my time, we served with noble and ethical leaders: Gerry Ford, Bob Michael, John Rhodes, men of impeccable honesty. We didn't have anybody locked up for a violation of ethics.","My wife and I have spent half our lives, half our adult lives, trying to save special parts of California.","The Republican Party is not in the hands of the Jewish lobby in America as the Democratic Party must look quite often to Jewish money to finance candidates."],"Pete Ploszek":["It was a real sort of synergistic 'Aha!' moment when I started acting.","Acting very quickly became a dream of mine, but the acting game privileges youth. It takes a while to build credits and, because of that, it's not the kind of career you can jump into in your 40s or 50s. The ship sets sail by then.","I was very fortunate to be raised with an 'if not you, then who?' mentality, and I count my blessings every day to have the support of my family and especially my wife. She's got a front-row seat on the roller coaster.","Working on a big-budget summer blockbuster with a built-in fan base is a dream come true for any actor."],"Pete Postlethwaite":["At the end of the day, acting is all about telling lies. We are professional imposters and the audience accept that. We've made this deal that we tell you a tale and a pack of lies, but there will be a truth in it. You may enjoy it, or it will disturb you.","When I made a breakthrough as an actor, people started to say, 'Who's that bloke with the funny name?' They advised me to change it, saying it would never be put up in lights outside theaters because they couldn't afford the electricity. But I would never contemplate changing it. It's who I am.","Whenever I get a good script, I don't care whether it's telly or theatre or big screen - I'm not bothered.","I like playing characters that are complex, that are intriguing, that come from left field, that do things that are unexpected. I don't like people who just follow one line and that's it - that's why I could never be in a sitcom, I don't think. They're not intriguing enough for me.","I was born and bred a Catholic. I was brought up a very strong Catholic - I practiced in a seminary for four years, from eleven to fourteen, and trained to be a Catholic priest. So I was very steeped in all that.","I'm not a practicing Catholic now. I didn't like what the church was doing with what Jesus had said, in a way. But I wouldn't say I'm not religious.","I refuse to be typecast, and I'll have a go at anything so long as it's different, challenging, hard work and demands great versatility.","I couldn't imagine living my life with another name."],"Pete Rose":["If somebody is gracious enough to give me a second chance, I won't need a third.","Willie Mays could throw better, and Hank Aaron could hit more home runs. But I've got enthusiasm. I've got desire. I've got hustle. Those are God-given talents, too.","I'd walk through hell in a gasoline suit to play baseball.","I never gave up as a player, and I won't give up as someone who wants to go to the Hall of Fame, because it's the ultimate goal for a baseball player or a football player or a basketball player.","There's other ways to make your head and muscles bigger than just steroids.","Are you tall? Are you strong? How big are your hands? You must be honest with yourself or you will end up using the wrong bat.","Back in 1960 at Christmas time, I did work loading and unloading boxcars for Railway Express. That was a kind of weight training that helped me. I weighed about 160 when I started. I began to gain weight and kept right on gaining until I reached 195 pounds.","I love the fans, I love the game of baseball, and I love Cincinnati baseball.","When somebody wants to interview me, I've always got something to say.","My father taught me that the only way you can make good at anything is to practice, and then practice some more.","Somebody's gotta win and somebody's gotta lose and I believe in letting the other guy lose.","Sliding headfirst is the safest way to get to the next base, I think, and the fastest. You don't lose your momentum, and there's one more important reason I slide headfirst, it gets my picture in the paper.","When you play this game twenty years, go to bat ten-thousand times, and get three-thousand hits, do you know what that means? You've gone zero for seven-thousand.","I'm just like everybody else. I have two arms, two legs and four-thousand hits.","Some players you pat their butts, some players you kick their butts, some players you leave alone.","I owe baseball. Baseball don't owe me a damn thing.","I bet on my team to win every night because I love my team; I believe in my team. I did everything in my power every night to win that game.","Never bet on baseball.","I was born on the day Lincoln was shot and the Titanic sank.","I would think if someone connected to steroids made the Hall of Fame, that would enhance my chances of making the Hall of Fame.","I played with 11 Hall of Famers and played against 52 Hall of Famers, and I don't know any of them linked to steroids.","I like Barack Obama as a person. He's articulate, he knows sports, his brother-in-law's a coach. He always has the athletes to the White House. But I don't know about some of his policies and some of these people in Congress.","I know about winning batting titles.","Doctors tell me I have the body of a thirty year old. I know I have the brain of a fifteen year old. If you've got both, you can play baseball.","I admitted I bet on baseball, but I wasn't suspended from baseball for betting on baseball.","Of course, I believe that Mike Piazza is probably the greatest offensive catcher in the history of baseball, only got over 50%. Johnny Bench is the best catcher in the history of baseball, but Piazza has all the record for catchers as far as offensively.","No matter how many times you say you're sorry, somebody is not going to hear you.","I met Gerald Ford. I met Richard Nixon. I met Jimmy Carter. I met Dwight Eisenhower when he was a general. George Bush senior. I haven't met Bill Clinton or George W. Bush, although I got a letter from him.","It's a round ball and a round bat, and you got to hit it square.","See the ball; hit the ball.","I've never looked forward to a birthday like I'm looking forward to my new daughter's birthday, because two days after that is when I can apply for reinstatement.","Am I still in uniform? Then I ain't retired.","Brooks Robinson belongs in a higher league.","Playing baseball for a living is like having a license to steal.","The greatest competitor was Bob Gibson. He worked so fast out there and he always had the hood up. He always wanted to close his own deal. He never talked to you because he was battling so hard. I sure as hell don't miss batting against him, but I miss him in the game.","The manager of a team is like a stagecoach, he can't move unless he has the horses.","There is an old saying that money can't buy happiness. If it could, I would buy myself four hits every game.","The team that wins two-thirds of its one run games usually wins the pennant.","When I get the record, all it will make me is the player with the most hits. I'm also the player with the most at bats and the most outs. I never said I was a greater player than Cobb.","With the money I'm making, I should be playing two positions.","I don't think there's any honor bigger than going to your Hall of Fame for your sport.","I don't go to bed every night worried about getting back into baseball.","You know, baseball's not stupid. Baseball does what the fans want, usually.","I bet on baseball in 1987 and 1988.","No one ever asked what was my relationship with Bart Giamatti. We used to talk about baseball a lot as a player and a commissioner, just talk about the game, what could we do to help the game, where's the game going, he was pretty good.","I bet on the game of baseball and I bet on my team, even the mistakes I made, I have to take a different look at someone betting against their own team... that's throwing the game.","I can't remember, I wish I could remember the first time I bet on baseball.","I'm not sure Mark McGwire was a Hall of Famer to begin with.","I know everything about Ty Cobb except the size of his hat.","In the old days, you know, they didn't have batting cages. And in most ball parks, they only had one runway to the dugout.","Baseball is an individual game, but it should never be a personal game.","I always liked the defensive part of baseball.","They haven't given too many gamblers a second chances in the world of baseball.","When guys do books or stories, all I like to see is the truth.","I look at the records, and you don't win the Cy Young seven times or the MVP without being a good player.","Sometimes, when you don't have spark, someone in the dugout has to create something.","A team will take on its manager's personality. If it's a laid back manager, you'll have a laid back personality. The players will see that if it's OK for the Manager to be laid back, then you'll have a laid back team.","If baseball wants to get you, they've got enough resources and enough investigators that they'll find a way to get you.","Sparky Anderson taught me this a long time ago: 'There's three ways you can treat a person. You can pat 'em on the butt, you can kick 'em in the butt, or you can leave 'em alone.'","If you screw up and do something, don't lie about it; come clean.","I never picked up my phone and called a bookmaker and bet on a baseball game from the clubhouse. Never.","I'm not going to go back to gambling; I mean, it's as simple as that.","We were so poor when I was a kid that I had a sister who was stamped, 'Made In Japan.'","There is no doubt that because I am a switch hitter I have one of the best offensive advantages that a hitter can have.","When you ask people about guys they didn't like because they were aggressive, there's me, John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors; not too many names would come up.","Since 1869, baseball has been doing pretty well.","Baseball and the players association have rules. If you stay within the rules - which say that you can play while you're appealing - I don't see what anyone would be in arms about.","I'm built like my dad. Stocky, strong.","My body is my best asset.","No player or manager has greater respect for the umpires than I do, and I have demonstrated that over the years.","I am grateful that I live in a nation where most believe that one's punishment should fit their wrongdoing and that ours is a nation that judges an individual by both what he has done and how he has changed.","I actually went to some Gamblers Anonymous classes, and I sat there for three or four of them, and I'm trying to figure out what I have in similarities with these other people, and I could never find anything. It just seems like it wasn't the right place for me.","You don't dominate any sport when you're over 40.","I get accused of talking about records. But it's the guys who interview me who ask about them.","I love WWE.","When people think of me, they think about me knocking catchers down and knocking second basemen down and yelling at pitchers. But when I took the spikes off after the game, I was a nice guy when I went home.","Who cares if you bunt for a base hit?","Umpires got power, man. You ever notice if you go to a ballpark and there's a close play on first base, they will not run the replay at the ballpark? I've seen umpires go underneath and call up and say if you run one more of those replays, we're gonna forfeit the game. That's how strong their union is.","I came to Vegas because I work 20 days a month here; I couldn't live anywhere else.","Hillary Clinton wrote a book. She got paid. I don't understand why I can't.","I still gamble, but it's all legal. I own horses, and I go to watch my horse. I don't go daily.","A lot of these catchers don't understand that they are blocking the plate and they don't have the ball. You're not allowed to block the plate without the ball.","Your obligation as a base runner is to try and be safe within the rules. OK?","The game of baseball is better when the Dodgers are playing well, just like when the Yankees are playing well, or the Cubs, the Phillies, the big-name teams.","Any time you've got big teams winning, you've got big stars.","I had an addiction to play baseball.","Some of my biggest friends are big-time horse owners.","Obama's a great speaker. Because of his speaking ability and his appearance, a lot of guys got on board. Being the first African American, a lot guys got on board.","Can you be a nicer gentleman, or a better man for your sport or your kids than Joe Paterno?"],"Pete Rozelle":["At least I'm going into the job with clean hands.","Every franchise of both leagues will remain in its present location.","There are a lot more TV sets in use on Monday night than on Sunday afternoon.","At last, someone came to tell me I'd been selected as commissioner, which gave rise to the line that I took the job with clean hands. I was then taken downstairs to a press conference, and the reporters were as surprised as I was.","But I haven't met a player or a coach whose goal isn't to win the Super Bowl.","Considering what Americans have been confronted with in the last ten years, domestically and internationally, it's clear that we need emotional outlets; we have to have some peace from our problems.","I don't know if 1300 players could really participate in the selection of a commissioner, and I've never given it a great deal of thought. I think it's a logical point they could make, but it's only an academic one.","I think the big thing I've had going for me in that regard has been the success of the league. I don't have quite as much control over things as people believe, so I frequently receive more credit than I deserve, and occasionally more criticism as well.","I'm not claiming that football is the nation's salvation in this area, but it's one of them, one little thing that apparently has captured the imagination of a large sector of our society. But when football can't be a relatively pure outlet, a fun thing, then it hurts itself.","I'm not saying that the press is wrong to report any internal differences we have, but at the same time, I think it's our job to keep them from becoming public issues, for anything that detracts from the purely athletic aspects of the sport is bad for us.","In fact, an awful lot of N.F.L. club owners have practically no influence on their players at all, simply because they're not full-time working owners.","People are interested in pro football because it provides them with an emotional oasis; they don't want football to get involved in the same types of court cases, racial problems and legislative issues they encounter in the rest of American life.","Pro football was taking off when I became commissioner, and when a sport's successful and you're its chief executive officer, much of the credit flows to you and you develop a good track record.","Rather than saying that the commissioner is hired by the owners and therefore is subservient to them, you have to look at whether or not the players are getting a fair shake.","Squabbling in public will eventually ruin football; there's no doubt it's hurting us already. Polls taken by Louis Harris - polls as valid as any political polls - indicate that very clearly.","The most difficult owner for me was the late George Marshall of Washington."],"Pete Sampras":["Tennis is seen all around the world; if I am home or anywhere in the country, United States, people will stare.","I let my racket do the talking. That's what I am all about, really. I just go out and win tennis matches.","Where I fall down is my short game. I don't practice enough, and when I have to take a half swing from 50 yards out, that's trouble.","Retirement is a work in progress. I try to figure out my day, and what I know about myself is that I need structure.","People wrote me off, but I believed in myself. I got the confidence back, and it grew and grew. I won my first major and my last at the place that changed my life.","The difference of great players is at a certain point in a match they raise their level of play and maintain it. Lesser players play great for a set, but then less.","I don't know how I do it, I really don't.","I've got a great wife, a great life.","I could be a jerk and get a lot more publicity, but that's not who I am.","I'm staying in shape, working out.","People know me. I'm not going to produce any cartwheels out there. I'm not going to belong on Comedy Central. I'll always be a tennis player, not a celebrity.","For so long people have just taken what I do for granted. It is not easy to do year-in, year-out, to win Grand Slams and be No. 1.","Golfers are forever working on mechanics. My tennis swing hasn't changed in 10 years.","I am going to hold serve the majority of the time. It is nice to have a little time to return serve.","If Davis Cup was a little bit less or once every two years, I would be more inclined to play. But the way it is now, it is too much tennis for me.","In tennis, you can make a couple of mistakes and still win. Not in golf. I played three rounds in that Tahoe event, and I was drained. Mentally, not physically.","It is nice to walk out on a court to have it packed.","There's always one shot that I can rely on when I'm not hitting the ball that well, is my serve.","You kind of live and die by the serve.","When you retire you want to get as far away as possible from the game for a couple of years.","I loved Wimbledon and what it meant, but the surface felt uncomfortable. I just didn't like it, I was a hard-court guy, a Californian kid.","All I cared about in tennis was winning.","I don't look at myself as a historical icon, but the reality of it is, yeah, I am playing for history now.","I hate to lose, and I do whatever I can to win, and if it is ugly, it is ugly.","Andre Agassi was my rival in the '90s, and I think as we got older we sort of transcended the game. He was probably the best player I ever played over my career. There's a list of players that were tough, but Andre, certainly, he was the most unique.","After I went through two years of not winning an event, what kept me going was winning one more major. Once I won that last U.S. Open, I spent the next six months trying to figure out what was next. Slowly my passion for the sport just vanished. I had nothing left to prove.","It's not easy to retire at 31. In one respect I was glad I was done. But after a few years of having fun, I got a little restless. When you're 33, 34, and you don't have a focus, you can get kind of lost. As a man, you feel a little bit unfulfilled.","It's not my place to tell you whom to vote for, to take any political stand, to tell you what religion to believe in. I'm an athlete. I can influence certain things, but when I see other athletes and celebrities telling you whom to vote for, I actually get a bit offended.","I've been into golf, trying to get into the gym to stay somewhat fit. I've got two boys now, they're active kids.","I can't just wake up and watch TV and do nothing. I need a day off working out, seeing the wife, play a little golf, see my kids.","I've worked hard my whole life, since I was a little kid. But now it's a point in my life now where I can just enjoy it, but at the same time I still need to work.","I did it my way, and I have no regrets when I look back on my career that it was just a big focus for me.","I never wanted to be the great guy or the colorful guy or the interesting guy. I wanted to be the guy who won titles.","When I committed to playing a little tennis in some exhibitions, it was the best thing for me. It got me in shape. It got me out of the house. It got me doing something I love to do."],"Pete Seeger":["I want to turn the clock back to when people lived in small villages and took care of each other.","It's a very important thing to learn to talk to people you disagree with.","Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't.","Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't.","Songs won't save the planet, but neither will books or speeches.","According to my definition of God, I'm not an atheist. Because I think God is everything. Whenever I open my eyes, I'm looking at God. Whenever I'm listening to something, I'm listening to God.","I still call myself a communist, because communism is no more what Russia made of it than Christianity is what the churches make of it.","Being generous of spirit is a wonderful way to live.","I came from an intellectual family. Most were doctors, preachers, teachers, businessmen. My grandfather was a small businessman. His father was an abolitionist doctor, and his father was an immigrant from Germany.","The good and bad are all tangled up together. American popular music is loved around the world because of its African rhythm. But that wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for slavery.","I keep reminding people that an editorial in rhyme is not a song. A good song makes you laugh, it makes you cry, it makes you think.","I've found that festivals are a relatively painless way to meet people and make a few points that need making, without having to hit them over the head with too many speeches.","I came along and was a teenager in the Depression, and nobody had jobs. So I went out hitchhiking, when I met a man named Woody Guthrie. He was the single biggest part of my education.","I am not going to answer any questions as to my association, my philosophical or religious beliefs or my political beliefs, or how I voted in any election, or any of these private affairs.","When you're facing an opponent over a broad front, you don't aim for the opponent's strong points, important though they may be. Pick a little outpost that you can capture and win. And then you find another place that you can capture and win it, and then you move slowly toward the big places.","If there's something wrong, speak up!","Historically, I believe I was correct in refusing to answer their questions.","I think these are very improper questions for any American to be asked, especially under such compulsion as this. I would be very glad to tell you my life if you want to hear of it.","I love my country very dearly, and I greatly resent the implication that some of the places that I have sung and some of the people that I have known, and some of my opinions, whether they are religious or philosophical, make me less of an American.","I have sung for Americans of every political persuasion, and I am proud that I never refuse to sing to an audience, no matter what religion or color of their skin, or situation in life.","I have sung in hobo jungles, and I have sung for the Rockefellers, and I am proud that I have never refused to sing for anybody.","You'd be surprised how many stupid mistakes I've made. I make stupid mistakes all the time, and some of them have been very big stupid mistakes.","I'm still a communist in the sense that I don't believe the world will survive with the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer - I think that the pressures will get so tremendous that the social contract will just come apart.","I am saying voluntarily that I have sung for almost every religious group in the country, from Jewish and Catholic, and Presbyterian and Holy Rollers and Revival Churches, and I do this voluntarily.","Some of my ancestors were religious dissenters who came to America over three hundred years ago. Others were abolitionists in New England in the eighteen forties and fifties.","I believe that my choosing my present course I do no dishonor to them, or to those who may come after me.","Down through the centuries, this trick has been tried by various establishments throughout the world. They force people to get involved in the kind of examination that has only one aim and that is to stamp out dissent.","One of the things I'm most proud of about my country is the fact that we did lick McCarthyism back in the fifties.","I fought for peace in the fifties.","I feel that my whole life is a contribution.","Again, I say I will be glad to tell what songs I have ever sung, because singing is my business.","But I decline to say who has ever listened to them, who has written them, or other people who have sung them.","I decline to discuss, under compulsion, where I have sung, and who has sung my songs, and who else has sung with me, and the people I have known.","I like to say I'm more conservative than Goldwater. He just wanted to turn the clock back to when there was no income tax.","If I've got a talent, it's for picking the right song at the right time for the right audience. And I can always get people to sing with me.","My mother was a very good violinist; my father was a musicologist and spent most of his life in academia.","I live in the country, so I get a fair amount of exercise. We heat our house with wood, so I split wood. We also live on a steep hill, and I have to rake and put in cross-stitches to keep the road from washing out when there's a big rain.","I try to sing many different kinds of songs. If I sing a batch of humorous songs, I'll throw in a deadly serious song. Or if I'm singing too many serious songs, I'll throw in a ridiculous song, to mix it up.","When you play the 12-string guitar, you spend half your life tuning the instrument and the other half playing it out of tune."],"Pete Sessions":["Guns aren't the problem; sick people are.","The entire issue is that women bear a disproportionate share of the hard work. Birthing, carrying, the whole thing - it's hard work.","Our nation's Social Security Trust Fund is depleting at an alarming rate, and failure to implement immediate reforms endangers the ability of Americans to plan for their retirement with the options and certainty they deserve.","Everybody thinks you can get by by being Mr. Nice Guy, but that's not what winning programs do. Winning programs have a plan.","I know of not one Republican candidate that would not appear publicly with Mitt Romney and I know many Democrats that don't even want to be in the same city - forget the same stage - with President Obama.","The purpose of the minority is to become the majority.","Simply put, ObamaCare cost Americans jobs through uncertainty and now implementation threatens even more jobs. No wonder the majority of Americans continue to oppose it.","The government should not pick up every single bit of healthcare to where literally 60 percent of every dollar is just in your last 60 days of life. We should be more balanced than that and give people a chance to understand what the government should and should not pay for.","If you look at what is happening in Republican conventions across the country, they are energized. And the message is really the same - that is, big government is a problem, spending is a problem.","History shows one important fact: the results of competitive special elections from Hawaii to New York are poor indicators of broader trends or future general election outcomes.","Tax cuts create more jobs and this is something we as Republicans have to do a better job of marketing.","As families and small businesses alike are tightening their belts to account for the worsening economy, they have every right to ask: 'Why isn't my government doing the same?'","The United States can no longer rely upon foreign nations such as China to bail us out of our economic irresponsibility. We must live within our means and implement creative, free-market solutions to put Americans back in jobs and to create economic opportunities.","Americans know that we cannot tax and spend our way out of a recession, yet Democrats can't grasp this simple fact.","History shows that tax increases during a recession are a recipe for greater unemployment and economic loss.","Whether it's Jack Kennedy or Bill Clinton or others, the personal lives do come into play, and people do judge you for that.","We have to allow people in the states to make their own decisions, to get government agencies out of the way and let local people make decisions about what's best for them.","You know, I think that President Obama is a person who has a great relationship with a number of people. Colin Powell does, too. I think Colin Powell is a fine American, a great leader and sees things in President Obama that he agrees with. He's entitled to have his opinion.","You can say that I endorse Mitt Romney, but that's not just because I'm a white man. We all have things which we're for and ideas which we support."],"Pete Stark":["Every American, regardless of their background, has the right to live free of unwarranted government intrusion. Repealing the worst provisions of the Patriot Act will reign in this gross abuse of power and restore to everyone our basic Constitutional rights.","It is time we had a defense budget that lives within its means, accounts for what is truly required in Iraq and provides the best possible support for all our troops.","I think unleashing 3,000 smart bombs against the city of Baghdad in the first several days of the war... to me, if those were unleashed against the San Francisco Bay Area, I would call that an act of extreme terrorism.","You little fruitcake, you little fruitcake, I said you are a fruitcake.","We are a long way from getting back the jobs lost since President Bush took office."],"Pete Townshend":["The bad part about growing older is I'm going bald. The good part is my nose seems to be getting shorter.","When I grew up, what was interesting for me was that music was color and life was gray. So music for me has always been more than entertainment.","Early British pop was helped tremendously by the writing of Bob Dylan who had proved you could write about political and quite controversial subjects. Certainly what we did followed on from what was happening with the angry young men in the theatre.","If I told you what it takes to reach the highest high you'd laugh and say nothing that simple, but you've been told many times before messiah's point you to the door though no one's got the guts to leave the temple.","In order to have faith, or follow any other organized religion, I'd have to suspend a degree of disbelief.","We tried not to age, but time had its rage.","When The Who first started, we were playing blues, and I dug the blues and I knew what I was supposed to be playing, but I couldn't play it. I couldn't get it out. I knew what I had to play; it was in my head. I could hear the notes in my head, but I couldn't get them out on the guitar.","I want to age with some dignity.","I've learned a huge amount because I've been tested and, more importantly, I've been trusted.","Entertainment came out of this thing called a television, and it was gray. Most of the films that we saw at the cinema were black and white. It was a gray world. And music somehow was in color.","Keith Moon is not interested in jazz and won't ever be a jazz drummer because he's more interested in looking good and being screamed at.","Backstage, I get sleepy, and want to curl up and snooze. I never get nervous, whatever the event. I feel quite detached until I walk on stage, and then some gear inside me clicks and off I go like a wind up doll.","It's like the mod thing is happening again.","I think I probably would have enjoyed to keep my own private pain out of my work. But I was changed by my audience who said your private pain which you have unwittingly shown us in your early songs is also ours.","Even modern English people are imperious, superior, ridden by class. All of the hypocrisy and the difficulties that are endemic in being British also make it an incredibly fertile place culturally. A brilliant place to live. Sad but true.","I felt that the elegance of pop music was that it was reflective: we were holding up a mirror to our audience and reflecting them philosophically and spiritually, rather than just reflecting society or something called 'rock and roll.'","It's an ordinary day for Brian. Like, he died every day, you know.","Most of my songs are about Jesus. Most of my songs are about the idea that there is salvation, and that there is a Savior. But I won't mention his name in a song just to get a cheap play.","What the Who is all about is exactly that and it always has been. If it exists today for this concert, it's in response again to a function which is happening out there on the street.","What we learned quite early on is what was really important to early British pop that we produced-and this is where we were distinct from almost everybody else in this respect-is that it had to reflect exactly what the audience wanted us to say.","What theatre started to look at much earlier than any other form was the internal operations of ordinary people, sometimes using mythic models in order to tell the story.","But what was interesting about what the Who did is that we took things which were happening in the pop genre and represent them to people so that they see them in a new way. I think the best example is Andy Warhol's work, the image of Marilyn Monroe or the Campbell's soup can.","Bob Dylan did the first really long record - Like A Rolling Stone - I think it was four minutes.","Some of our early work was two minutes twenty when it actually came out on vinyl, very, very, very short. Sometimes if you made a three-minute record they would make you do an edited version for radio, particularly in America.","I just could not believe that 30 years later we're still looking at people who are supposed to write little 2-minute pop that when they actually try to do something that's a little bit more they regard it as pretentious.","What I took back, because of my exposure to the Jewish music of the 30s and the 40s in my upbringing with my father, was that kind of theatrical songwriting. It was always a part of my character. This desire to make people laugh.","The problem for me, still today, is that I write purely with one dramatic structure and that is the rite of passage. I'm not really skilled in any other. Rock and roll itself can be described as music to accompany the rite of passage.","I'm only interested in rites of passage stories.","I only really started to go to plays and to be interested in drama 20 years ago when as an artist I was already well-rounded. I think I'm more disciplined today.","A lot of my audience are in their 50s. But they want me to pretend to continue to be pretending.","As a young man, every bone in my body wanted to pick up a machine gun and kill Germans. And yet I had absolutely no reason to do so. Certainly nobody invited me to do the job. But that's what I felt that I was trained to do. Now no part of my upbringing was militaristic.","It wasn't just about flashing lights and pinball machines blowing up and things like that. It was about using encores, bringing back the good songs and using techniques that I knew about from rock performance.","Everything that I had done creatively related to two or three incidents that happened to me when I was a child that I'd forgotten. Everything, absolutely everything.","What I'm trying to do is find either existing properties or come up with properties or angles or stories which will create music drama. It's my obsession and most of all I would like to remain working in theatre. I think it's very much alive.","I know how it feels to be a woman because I am a woman. And I won't be classified as just a man.","He is the king. If it hadn't been for Link Wray and 'Rumble', I would have never picked up a guitar.","I have terrible hearing trouble. I have unwittingly helped to invent and refine a type of music that makes its principal proponents deaf.","I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth.","I have to say that anger is the blanket that comes around me, and that blunts and blurs my sense of proportion.","I bought a Dutch barge and turned it into a recording studio. My plan was to go to Paris and record rolling down the Seine.","It's sad when people break up.","I don't really know any other musicians like me. I grew up backstage with my dad who played in a post-war dance band, so I always feel at home at a venue.","For a while I was perfectly happy not performing with 'The Who.' From 1982 to 1989 I felt 'The Who' did not exist. I let the band go, in my heart. However, Roger Daltrey had other ideas. He would not let go.","I felt that The Who had ended because we'd lost touch with our original Shepherd's Bush audience.","I needed to give back, give back, give back. I felt guilty about my success. I felt uncomfortable about how easily I had been delivered this extraordinary life that I had.","To be completely honest, I think if I hadn't been bullied into the band, I would have been happier as an art student. I would have been happier in a Brian Eno world.","I used to try and make up visually for what I couldn't play as a musician. I used to get into very incredible visual things where, in order just to make one chord more lethal, I'd make it a really lethal looking thing, whereas really it's just going to be picked normally.","Although I dig my guitar playing, I think it's kind of an obvious situation; I play what I want to play within my own restrictions.","A lot of writing I do on tour. I do a lot on airplanes. At home, I write a lot, obviously. When I write a song, what I usually do is work the lyric out first from some basic idea that I had, and then I get an acoustic guitar and I sit by the tape recorder and I try to bang it out as it comes.","My father had played the guitar when he was young, and my uncle Jack had worked for Kalamazoo, before the war, developing guitar pickups. So there was a kind of family thing about the guitar, although it was considered something of an anomaly then.","My father was in a dance band, and I wanted to do what he did, play the saxophone, but I couldn't blow a note, so he suggested the guitar. Chromatic harmonica was actually my first instrument, and I got very good at it - not quite Stevie Wonder, but very good.","English banjo players really were a law unto themselves - you don't find that kind of brisk banjo playing on the original Louis Armstrong or Bix Beiderbecke records.","I didn't start to collect records and listen to guitar players properly until I went to art school, when I'd already been playing for five years. So my style was already formed, and that's why I think it's so unique.","I saw the Internet as being something which would allow power mongers to control us, and that we would willingly go to that if it promised us salvation - if it promised to show us who we were and let us find ourselves as we had, uniquely in our generation, through rock music.","In a sense, the god we trust politically is a slightly different god than the one we bring into the fray when we enter a rock concert. One of the things I can say with absolute conviction is that I worship that god.","I don't view the fans in the way that most performers do. As a mass of people who have paid money, I know what they want. It's a very, very, very, very, very low common denominator."],"Pete Visclosky":["You should always be questioning your government, but do not become cynical.","I believe that we need to set conditions to close the detention facility at Guantanamo. This includes retaining the option to transfer detainees from this facility elsewhere... It is in the U.S.'s national security interest to do so.","I've dedicated my life to public service, and I feel it's still a noble profession. However, I also understand it's a contact sport."],"Pete Waterman":["Everybody likes a roller coaster ride.","I don't mind losing, but I don't like losing to cheats.","There's a certain edge about cruelty. If you're honest about it, most people wince, but say it had to be said.","The public are not stupid.","Spin Me Round was number one all over the world, everywhere. It changed the face of pop music, no question. We took technology further than Trevor Horn.","Reality TV is here, it's been here really since the Carol Levis Discovery Show in 1957. It's never changed. It just looks a bit different.","Reality TV finds talented people. There are no scripts. The editing is what it's all about. Great editing makes those shows.","Past is past.","It is dishonest the way that people suddenly think they've found guitars, and wear their guitar as a badge.","If you're rude for television's sake, it ain't reality TV.","I'm not going to say that every record I've put out was the greatest record in history, but I'd stand by even the bad ones. Don't make excuses, make hits.","I was very cheap - that's the way I'd always worked.","I thought if Oasis could get away with sounding like The Beatles, I could get away with sounding like Abba.","I think that's where reality TV works - you don't know where it's going.","I think Robbie Williams is an utter and complete prat. His last record was a pile of rubbish.","I laughed, even if I was the butt of the joke.","Give the public what they want. What you want is unimportant.","Everything I touch turns to gold.","Certainly in the modern age where everything is glossed over, when somebody speaks their mind, the majority of the public go, I'd love to have said that."],"Pete Wentz":["The only good thing about times of adversity is that you realize who your real friends and fans are - and the rest go away - which in my mind is an OK thing.","Somewhere I just want to find someone that's going to love me forever no matter what; I want someone to show the inside of my head to. That thought keeps me going.","I feel confidence in myself, but at the same time there's these cracks in the facade and those little things underneath that are unstable.","When I was in high school, my thing was to get as close as humanly possible to a girl and just make her have to kiss me! You do the hug that's too close, where your mouth is close to hers and you kinda feel it out a little bit.","What would rock and roll be without ambition, craziness, danger, and fun?","I think it's important to look at the world as a bigger place than just the bubble that we live in. It's so easy to get caught up in things of a trivial nature.","Everyone has learned how to monetize music except the music industry.","I like idolator.com a lot. Every once in a while they shred me on there, but it's usually pretty funny.","Boys in bands are more difficult to deal with than one-year-old babies. I've been one of them, and I am one of them, but it is the truth.","Fall Out Boy never pretended that we were anything but pop-rock.","I was totally into cartoon babes when I was a little dude. Cheetara from the 'Thundercats,' then Jessica Rabbit, and finally I moved onto a real-life human being and was into Punky Brewster, and then Christina Applegate on 'Married with Children.'","I think I ended up on 'People's '50 Most Beautiful People' list just because of eyeliner, which is kind of a bummer. But if you do find the right color, it will make your eyes pop.","I think Kurt Cobain and Nirvana represent this giant wave that came crashing in and turned music on its head again, and there's definitely something to be said for that.","You're gonna meet tons of different people throughout your life, and it's totally worth it to stick your neck out a little bit if you like someone. Even when you get shot down, it seems really devastating, but it's not in the long run.","I was diagnosed with ADD - see also: raised on sugary cereals and cartoons - and manic depression. So I was prescribed Ritalin for the ADD, and for the manic imbalances I was prescribed mostly benzodiazepines, which I loved, and antidepressants.","With marriage and fatherhood, I've finally found two fixed points in my life. They've taught me patience. They've also taught me that I don't need to feel guilty about being happy. My emotional seasons are less extreme.","I think we live a culture that's obsessed with people, you know, 'Celebrities are just like us!' Everything I do except my job is critically analyzed online.","When I heard 'Dookie' by Green Day for the first time, it unlocked something in me, like, it's totally okay that I'm a little bit weird because these guys are a little bit weird. It made me want to pick up an instrument and do that.","I'll be honest: I was a super-late bloomer, and I was kind of a prude.","There's nothing worse than watching an old wrinkly guy going, 'Hey, baby.' You're like, 'Dude, that's lame.' It's cool to fall in love and grow old with someone.","I wish I had never taken naked pictures of myself on a phone to send to a girl. It's the worst thing ever.","I think people who just know me from my band think I don't like pop music. The truth is I love pop music.","In the past, my brain would never stop. Now I'm a father; the world no longer revolves around me. When I'm with Bronx, he's got my complete attention. He's the only thing that occupies my thoughts.","I love writing, but I have that E. E. Cummings idea that as long as you stay inside the rules of your own world, it doesn't matter what it is.","I'm not as well read as I was when I was younger - I just devoured books.","I'm in the process of convincing my parents to sell me their house so I can just live in my childhood bedroom forever. I figure it might make me age slower.","I had aspirations to do different things with my life. I wanted to play soccer. I wanted to be a lawyer. Serendipity.","The only reason you even start a band is so you can hang out with your friends all the time, but somewhere along the line, it just ends up becoming a job. You were doing it because you were like, 'I never want to have to get a job,' then all of a sudden it becomes the biggest job you could ever imagine.","When I read a review, 90% of the review is about my lifestyle, and the last two sentences are about the record.","I would never come out and say I was gay, because I'm not gay. And there's part of me that kind of wishes I was gay, and I think that that comes from anybody who is constantly wishing they were in the minority, you know, and constantly wants to be kind of fighting everybody off, you know?","Soccer presented no challenge to me. Playing felt like breathing: I always had a magical connection to the ball. But it didn't feel like an adventure. Music was more of a challenge and, in the end, felt more interesting.","I like individual scents on a girl, so you always recognize her and you keep her separate from other people in your head. I really love Egyptian musk. I've even gone to the mall and sprayed perfumes and just smelled them. I'm creepy. So creepy.","I don't get on stage and give a social diatribe. I am a performer and an entertainer.","When I said that I make out with dudes, there was a slight sense of sexual rebellion in that. And I probably even made it a bigger deal than it was.","It's bizarre to have both a super-connected and disconnected world. Like, you can use Twitter in the most narcissistic way. Do people really need to know that I'm drinking a latte right now? It's so indulgent.","Look: I download music illegally, if I really want it. But I always then buy the record - I support art.","I've been an Obama supporter since he announced he was campaigning. I was aware of him as a senator, but I wasn't as engaged as I probably should've been.","I'm attracted to creative people and train wrecks, and there's no shortage of that in Los Angeles.","Here's the thing about hair; I think most people think that I have Lego hair, like I can just take it on and off in one piece, and that's not quite the case - although pretty close.","I think hair is just, like, the most important thing about you.","I remember my first kisses with a lot of people, and they're rad experiences. And you don't have to really take it to that next level because that's what keeps it exciting.","Sometimes the person that is best for you is the person right under your nose. I wanted to have a girlfriend in high school, and I know I would have treated a girl well, but instead I was just friends with a lot of girls. They ended up telling me later on, 'We're so perfect together,' but at the time, I wasn't the cool-enough guy.","As a kid, I always went to therapists; the first time was when my parents were separated on my sixth birthday, then on and off since then.","Ultimately, people do want to buy merch and tickets to support their favorite bands, but they don't want to feel like it's the only thing going on.","It's strange - there's a public persona of me that does nothing for me: the side of me where it's 'US Weekly,' where 12 cars sit outside my house because of who I married. That side never shuts off. I would like that to shut off sometimes, yes.","I'm a little bit of a makeout king. I don't discriminate too much.","I don't have an issue finding guys attractive.","For the most part, I hang out in my back yard with my dog, but there's no paparazzi trying to check that out.","I'm Michael Jackson-obsessed. All I watch is 'Moonwalker' - it's my favorite movie of all time.","I'm not into bands for the sake of being into bands. I've grown past that. There was a time in my life when I was that guy.","I don't think I understood guitar rock as well as I probably should have. I don't think I understood bands like Led Zeppelin. In their era, everyone had such a regard for them because of them ushering in rock n' roll and this larger-than-life lifestyle. But then they had these songs that would just not stop. I didn't fully get it.","There are bands that I got into when I was 15, when I was mad at my dad and just wanted to be different. I don't think I'd give those bands half a chance now. But I hold some kind of nostalgia for them that I won't let go. Bands like Minor Threat and Black Flag.","I think you need something to take care of in order to figure out who you are as a person, and in that way, being a dad has levelled me out more than anything. You've just got to be good for that person no matter what's going on in your head that day.","I think that the first part of the art is making the art, but when art really becomes art is when it belongs to somebody else.","If anyone saw Fall Out Boy's first 400 shows, we were the worst band of all time."],"Pete Wilson":["The First Amendment does not guarantee the press a constitutional right of special access to information not available to the general public, nor does it cloak the inmate with special rights of freedom of speech.","I was right then, I'm right now. I think time has proven me right.","It is clear that a temporary increase in the cap is needed to ensure high-tech companies can hire the specialized personnel they need to continue to help fuel California's economic growth."],"Pete du Pont":["Franklin Roosevelt was a great leader. He saw how to use the levers of power to affect change.","Franklin Roosevelt had to govern at a time of crisis. If you're going to make changes in the way a nation thinks, you have to have the ability to take the crisis of the moment and use it to shape an agenda.","Everyone matures. When I was Newt's age, I thought I had the right answer to things. The baby-boomers as political leaders are still on trial by the American people.","Has President Bush exceeded his constitutional authority or acted illegally in authorizing wiretaps without a warrant? Benjamin Franklin would not have thought so.","I come from a family that has been here for almost 200 years. My ancestors started a very dangerous gunpowder business in 1802, and my great- grandfather and his father were both killed in gunpowder explosions.","If we had known that one of those terrorist attacks was coming, could our government have electronically eavesdropped on the attackers without a warrant?","If you're going to try to win an election, you can't be 80 percent. You can't say, I'm for what my Democratic opponent is, for but not quite so much of it.","Moderates shouldn't be nervous about Newt because he has a vision, he's laid it forward. He's fundamentally leading us in the way that middle class Americans want to go.","Newt changed the frame of reference of all of our candidates. That's why we won so big in 1994.","Newt correctly assumes that the American public is beginning to look down the road and at least distinguish the landmarks on either side and know where it wants go. We have a chance to lead it there.","Newt Gingrich's job to capture the Congress was to give Republican candidates an edge and a distinction from their Democratic opponent. That required a very high profile, some very strong language.","Newt has two transitions behind him. First he had to capture control of the House. He had to get the Republican budget through. He had to get the Contract With America through. He has done that.","One of the tragedies of the Bush administration is that we went back to business as usual, make a deal with the Democrats, let's all be friends in Washington philosophy.","Our original idea was to help three or four hundred candidates in the first election run for the Ohio State legislature and the California legislature around the country.","Ronald Reagan gave our party a bowling alley image as opposed to a country club image. We were talking to people who go bowling on Thursday night, and they were understanding what we were saying.","Talk radio has made an enormous run around establishment media. But the Internet is making an end run around talk radio. Suddenly we're faced with an information age.","That's the way it is with entrepreneurial people. You try one thing, it doesn't work, you try another.","The sea change that has come is the information age. We don't have to just read The New York Times anymore. We can pull up something on the Internet and get any news that we like.","The struggle you see in the Republican Party today is the country club Republican versus the bowling alley Republican. Colin Powell brings us back to the country club image. He's an insider. He's a moderate.","There were some entrepreneurial du Ponts that are a little different from the heads of the corporations today.","There's a very big gulf between the black civil rights leadership in America and the black middle class in America. The black middle class are conservative. Many of those minorities can be persuaded to be members of the Republican Party.","Things move very slowly in politics. We seem to fight the same wars over and over again.","We didn't think taxes ought to go up. They ought to go down. We didn't think the census ought to be weakened."],"Peter A. Levine":["The paradox of trauma is that it has both the power to destroy and the power to transform and resurrect.","Trauma is a fact of life. It does not, however, have to be a life sentence.","The effects of unresolved trauma can be devastating. It can affect our habits and outlook on life, leading to addictions and poor decision-making. It can take a toll on our family life and interpersonal relationships. It can trigger real physical pain, symptoms, and disease. And it can lead to a range of self-destructive behaviors.","Whether trauma will be a cruel and punishing Gorgon or a vehicle for soaring to the heights of transformation and mastery depends upon how we approach it.","Trauma and sexual abuse are two of our most pressing human and societal problems. They must be studied by unbiased scientific investigation rather than polarized by hysteria and politics.","Trauma causes us to have an internal experience that is frightening, angry, and shameful. When we feel threatened, as we do when we are traumatized, our entire organism is geared up to find the source of that threat and to do something about it.","Abortions can be, and frequently are, traumatizing, as are other invasive surgeries performed to the sexual and internal organs. All or any of these 'violations' can cause loss of vitality, diminished capacity for erotic connection and pleasure, and other symptoms of trauma.","In top-down processing, which is normally what we do in psychotherapy, we talk about our problems, our symptoms, or our relationships. And then the therapist often tries to get the client to feel what they're feeling when they talk about those kinds of things.","While studying the effects of accumulated stress on the nervous system, I began to suspect that most organisms have an innate capacity to rebound from threatening and stressful events.","If frightening sensations are not given the time and attention they need to move through the body and resolve or dissolve, the individual will continue to be gripped by fear.","To my parents, Morris and Helen, I give thanks for the gift of life, the vehicle for the expression of my work, and for your continued full and unequivocal support from both sides of the physical plane.","I am profoundly indebted to the legacy of Wilhelm Reich, whose monumental contribution to the understanding of energy was taught to me by Philip Curcurruto, a man of simple wisdom and compassionate heart.","We may forget, or be unaware of, how prevalent it is to be sexually traumatized by events that are generally not thought of as traumatizing.","My career began somewhat accidentally. In the 1960s, I started a practice in the fledgling field of mind-body healing. Around that time, it was completely in its infancy. I had been developing a protocol to use body awareness as a tool for stress reduction.","Basically, in the fight-or-flight response, the objective is to get away from the source of threat. All of our muscles prepare for this escape by increasing their tension level, our heart rate and respiration increase, and our whole basic metabolic system is flooded with adrenaline.","Now, what happens whenever there's a loud sound is that it startles us, right? And we arrest what we're doing, and we try to localize that sound because that sound could be a threat. That's something that's hard-wired in our bodies.","I am often asked how I can work with a subject as morbid as trauma without becoming burned out or depressed. My answer to this question is that witnessing the transformation that takes place in people when they master their traumas has proven to be a deeply sustaining and uplifting experience in my life.","Though suffering and trauma are not identical, the Buddha's insight into the nature of suffering can provide a powerful mirror for examining the effects of trauma in your life. The Buddha's basic teaching offers guidance for healing our trauma and recovering a sense of wholeness."],"Peter Abelard":["It is by doubting that we come to investigate, and by investigating that we recognize the truth.","Our redemption through the suffering of Christ is that deeper love within us which not only frees us from slavery to sin, but also secures for us the true liberty of the children of God, in order that we might do all things out of love rather than out of fear - love for him that has shown us such grace that no greater can be found.","The key to wisdom is this - constant and frequent questioning, for by doubting we are led to question and by questioning we arrive at the truth.","By doubting we are led to question, by questioning we arrive at the truth.","Are you not moved to tears and bitter compassion, when you behold the only Son of God seized by the most impious, dragged away, mocked, scourged, buffeted, spit upon, crowned with thorns, hung upon the infamous cross between two thieves, finally in such a horrible and execrable manner suffering death, for your salvation and that of the world?","Logic has made me hated in the world.","The men who abandon themselves to the passions of this miserable life, are compared in Scripture to beasts.","The Son of God took our nature, and in it took upon himself to teach us by both word and example even to the point of death, thus binding us to himself through love.","I preferred the weapons of dialectic to all the other teachings of philosophy, and armed with these, I chose the conflicts of disputation rather than the trophies of war."],"Peter Abrahams":["Marxism, communism, socialism - the ideologies - did not have the automatic answers to the problem of the relations between the lighter and darker races of mankind. They did not even have an answer to anti-Semitism.","I attended school regularly for three years. I learned to read and write. 'Lamb's Tales' from Shakespeare was my favourite reading matter. I stole, by finding, Palgrave's 'Golden Treasury.' These two books, and the 'Everyman' edition of John Keats, were my proudest and dearest possessions, my greatest wealth.","The only places where I have found that simple human dignity, that respect for the other man, and the gracious feel of tolerance and humanity have not been either among the heroes of the class-struggle or the 'thinking men' but among my simple 'backward' people.","Perhaps life had a meaning that transcended race and colour. If it had, I could not find it in South Africa.","You can't walk alone. Many have given the illusion, but none have really walked alone. Man is not made that way. Each man is bedded in his people, their history, their culture, and their values.","With Shakespeare and poetry, a new world was born. New dreams, new desires, a self consciousness was born. I desired to know to know myself in terms of the new standards set by these books.","To get where you want to go you can't only do what you like.","Joseph and his mother come from the black kings who were before the white man.","Many have changed so much that they have lost the magic of the dream that carried them on their own bootstraps.","My mother was a member of the Cape Coloured community. 'Coloured' is the South African word for the half-caste community that was a by-product of the early contact between black and white.","The familiar mood that awaits the sensitive young who are poor and dispossessed is a mood of sharp and painful inferiority, of violently angry tensions, of desperate and overwhelming longings.","For me, personally, life in South Africa had come to an end. I had been lucky in some of the whites I had met. Meeting them had made a straight 'all-blacks-are-good, all-whites-are-bad' attitude impossible. But I had reached a point where the gestures of even my friends among the whites were suspect, so I had to go or be forever lost.","In the Caribbean islands, especially in Jamaica, have I found a country similar to South Africa plus the racial freedom I had sought so long.","I read every one of the books on the shelf marked American Negro Literature. I became a nationalist, a colour nationalist, through the writings of men and women who lived a world away from me.","Must simplicity and humanity go under in the interest of progress? What is the most important component of civilization - is it human or mechanical? Must thought processes become involved and insincere? Must the class-struggle warp those who are involved in it?","Positive social awareness among the South African educated half-caste is zero. Teaching is a mechanical job. The best way of earning a living.","A man can submit today in order to resist tomorrow. My submission had been such. And because I had not been free to show my real feeling, to voice my true thoughts, my submission had bred bitterness and anger. And there were nearly ten million others who had submitted with equal anger and bitterness.","All my life had been dominated by a sign, often invisible but no less real for that, which said: 'Reserved for Europeans Only.'","Tribal man is not an individual in the western sense. Psychologically and emotionally, he is the present living personification of a number of forces, among the most important of which are the ancestral dead.","My mother went to work in the homes of white folk, usually living in and looking after their children. The money was small.","Most of the black women who lived in the lower end of Vrededorp came from the countryside and were there to be near their menfolk who worked in the mines. They spoke neither English nor Afrikaans.","We do not ask the right questions when we are young, so we miss the important answers. Now it is too late to ask, too late for the illuminating answers, and the unanswered questions haunt us for a lifetime.","There is a qualitative difference between being a minority and being a majority. Majorities are stronger under psychological pressure because numbers count. But only if they are aware of it.","In East, South and Central Africa, the minority manipulated the majority into believing the minority was the majority, that there were more whites in the world than blacks; instilled in the blacks a sense of inferiority, inadequacy, worthlessness.","The London I entered was a great bustling metropolitan city at war, an imperial power fighting to hold on to that empire. And the teeming colonial subjects of that empire did not, on the whole, want England to lose that war, but they also did not want the empire to emerge unchanged from it. This, for very many of us, was the hard dilemma.","Being born white in South Africa or anywhere in the empire and Commonwealth automatically conferred this special status. You had no problem finding a place to live, a job, trade union membership, access to social services. Being white, speaking English, you were accepted as English, entitled to all the rights of citizenship.","To have the ability to destroy all and not to do it was one of the hard tests humanity passed - but only just - in the middle of the twentieth century.","The racism of the Nazis threatened to make whatever we had experienced look like child's play. If they could be so brutal to the Jews, what would they do to the blacks? So large numbers of black young men and women rallied to the defence of the empire."],"Peter Ackroyd":["It may seem unfashionable to say so, but historians should seize the imagination as well as the intellect. History is, in a sense, a story, a narrative of adventure and of vision, of character and of incident. It is also a portrait of the great general drama of the human spirit.","Thomas More rarely discussed his siblings, and two of them are never mentioned by him. It is likely that they were part of that infant mortality which had provoked such concern for early baptism.","Thomas More's birth was noted by his father upon a blank page at the back of a copy of Geoffrey of Monmouth's 'Historia Regum Britanniae'; for a lawyer John More was remarkably inexact in his references to that natal year, and the date has been moved from 1477 to 1478 and back again.","I don't believe necessarily the past is in the past. It's eternal, it's all around us.","In 'The Plato Papers' I wanted to get another perspective on the present moment by extrapolating into the distant future. So in that sense, there's a definite similarity of purpose between a book set in the future and a book set in the past.","Murderers will try to recall the sequence of events, they will remember exactly what they did just before and just after. But they can never remember the actual moment of killing. This is why they will always leave a clue.","London has always provided the landscape for my imagination. It becomes a character - a living being - within each of my books.","Rioting has always been a London tradition. It has been since the early Middle Ages. There's hardly a spate of years that goes by without violent rioting of one kind or another. They happen so frequently that they are almost part of London's texture.","His head was boiled, impaled upon a pole and raised above London Bridge. So ended the life of Thomas More, one of the few Londoners upon whom sainthood has been conferred and the first English layman to be beatified as a martyr.","All cities are impressive in their way, because they represent the aspiration of men to lead a common life; those people who wish to live agreeable lives, and in constant intercourse with one another, will build a city as beautiful as Paris.","Every book for me is a chapter in the long book which will finally be closed on the day of my death.","There are two types of people, you see. One type keep their heads straight, and look around as they walk. The others look up - at the tops of houses, at the eaves and the lintels and the roofs, which can tell you when they were built - and I've always done that.","My great fear has always been complete and utter failure. Hence, you see, all the dispossessed people in my fiction, and why I try to earn as much money as I can. It's a defense. I don't enjoy it or do anything with it.","I love soap operas - the stories, the plots! And I love the game shows and the courtroom dramas and the detectives - Jessica Fletcher, 'Columbo,' 'Perry Mason,' 'L.A. Law.' Any sense of guilt appeals to me in a television program - a sense of guilt, or a sense of making a lot of money.","In London, I've always lived within 10 miles of where I was born. You see, there is something called a spirit of place, and my place happens to be London, at least once a fortnight.","There are certain people who seem doomed to buy certain houses. The house expects them. It waits for them.","Familial love can find an echo in our own hearts just as it did in that of Charles Dickens.","I have always believed that the material world is governed by nonmaterial sources, so that in that sense 'English Music' is an exercise in the spiritual as well as the material. I have always been attracted to the Gothic and spiritual imagination, and I've always been interested in visionaries.","As a Londoner I was able to see how the world of power and money cast its shadow on those who failed.","It sometimes seems to me that the whole course of English history was one of accident, confusion, chance and unintended consequences - there's no real pattern.","Health, money. That's what people worried about in the 14th century as much as today. I find it so much more interesting than the supposed activities of kings, queens, generals.","None of my books has been ever in my head; after they're finished, they go. It's like being a sort of medium; you just grab it when it's there then just release it when it's time to go. There's a lot of instinct, not planning.","Freud was just a novelist.","I just wanted to be an ordinary, middle-class person. When I was at Cambridge, I made great efforts to lose the last remnants of my Cockney accent.","It's only recently that we've discovered that the artist's inner self is somehow more important than the public world. I'm happier to create exterior pieces for the world rather than to express something I deeply feel or wish to say.","I detest self-regard. If my work has taught me anything, it is that self-aggrandisement is completely unhistorical.","I don't find myself interesting as a person and the details I find boring, quite frankly. You could sum it up in a few words or sentences really: came from nothing. Self-educated. Luck. Energy. Curiosity. Ambition. That's it. Nothing at all can illuminate the work as far as I can tell.","You don't have to be brought up in a grand house to have a sense of the past, and I truly believe that there are certain people to whom or through whom the territory - the place, the past - speaks.","I can remember picking up weighty tomes on the history of science and the history of philosophy and reading those when I was small.","To be a writer was always my greatest aim. I remember writing a play about Guy Fawkes when I was 10. I suppose it's significant, at least to me, that my first work should be about a historical figure.","I enjoyed reading and learning at school, and at university I enjoyed extending my reading and learning. Once I left Cambridge, I went to Yale as a fellow. I spent two years there. After that, George Gale made me literary editor of 'The Spectator.'","When I was a child I wanted to be Pope. My greatest disappointment is missing out on that. I also wanted to be a tap dancer but I never fulfilled that ambition either.","I wanted to be a poet when I was 20; I had no interest in fiction or biography and precious little interest in history, but those three elements in my life have become the most important.","I never read in bed, only in my study.","The English have always been greedy for news of times past, with that mixture of fatalism and melancholy which is part of the national character.","The 16th-century theatre witnessed the particularly English manifestation of 'the history play.' There can be no doubt that Shakespeare's presentations of 'Henry V' and 'Richard III' have been incalculably more influential than any more sober historical study.","Why should a novelist not also be a historian? To force unnatural divisions within the English language is to work against its capacious and accommodating nature. To expect a writer to produce only novels, or only histories, is equivalent to demanding from a composer that he or she write only string quartets or piano sonatas.","To watch King Lear is to approach the recognition that there is indeed no meaning in life, and that there are limits to human understanding.","People are much more interesting than people realise.","I strike up conversations all the time and it is very interesting, finding out about things I know nothing about.","If I did only one thing at a time I'd think I was wasting my time. If, for example, I only wrote novels I would feel like a charlatan and a fraud.","I don't in any sense think of myself as a celebrity, which of course I'm not.","I don't know if I have a voice of my own. I don't see me being an important person with something to say. I haven't. I've got nothing to say. My opinion is of no consequence or value.","There are so many characters whizzing around inside my head, it's like Looney Tunes. But as soon as I've finished writing about them, I completely forget who they are.","Oh, I just tend to believe in things when I'm writing them. For instance, when I was writing 'Doctor Dee,' I believed in magic. And when I wrote 'Hawksmoor' I believed in psychic geography. But as soon as I type the last full stop, I'm back to being a complete blank again.","In so far as I have any beliefs, I suppose I'm like that old Peggy Lee song, 'Is That All There Is?' I want to believe there's something else going on, but what that something else is I don't pretend to know.","I saw a ghost once, about 20 years ago. It took the form of someone coming out of a sleeping body and sitting at the foot of the bed.","'London' is a gallery of sensation of impressions. It is a history of London in a thematic rather than a chronological sense with chapters of the history of smells, the history of silence, and the history of light. I have described the book as a labyrinth, and in that sense in complements my description of London itself.","I think biography can be more personal than fiction, and certainly can be more expressive."],"Peter Agre":["My brother Jim and I spent many wonderful summers working on dairy farms in Wisconsin owned by Mom's cousins, and as members of our local Boy Scout troop.","Written in 1895, Alfred Nobel's will endowed prizes for scientific research in chemistry, physics, and medicine. At that time, these fields were narrowly defined, and researchers were often classically trained in only one discipline. In the late 19th century, knowledge of science was not a requisite for success in other walks of life.","In science, one should use all available resources to solve difficult problems. One of our most powerful resources is the insight of our colleagues.","In 1862, Abraham Lincoln signed the Homestead Act, a bill opening one half million square miles of territory in the western United States for settlement.","While the lab plays an enormous role, research is also influenced by inner peace of mind and one's family environment, depending on what stage of one's life and career a scientist is at.","So, my advice to young scientists is, think critically about your work; probably don't blab unnecessarily.","Our lab had always refrained from keeping our studies secret.","Natural selection is not an inflammatory phrase; evolution is.","Now a cholera epidemic was sweeping through Southeast Asia and south Asia in the early 1970s, so I started medical school and I joined a laboratory to work on this.","Now in the 21st century, the boundaries separating chemistry, physics, and medicine have become blurred, and as happened during the Renaissance, scientists are following their curiosities even when they run beyond the formal limits of their training.","It is a remarkable honor to receive a Nobel Prize, because it not only recognizes discoveries, but also their usefulness to the advancement of fundamental science.","We always had lutefisk for Christmas dinner, after which Dad read from the Norwegian Bible.","Following my junior year in high school, I went on a camping trip through Russia in a group led by Horst Momber, a young language teacher from Roosevelt.","The long, cold Minnesota winters instilled in me a fascination for exotic far off places; I aspired toward a career in tropical diseases and world health problems.","Johns Hopkins introduced me to two defining events in my life: commitment to biomedical research and meeting my future wife, Mary.","My goal was to develop into an independent research scientist studying clinical problems at the laboratory bench, but I felt that postgraduate residency training in internal medicine was necessary.","The Department of Cell Biology at Johns Hopkins was founded and directed by Tom Pollard, an engaging young scientist with remarkable energy and enthusiasm.","Every cell in our body is primarily water. But the water doesn't just sit in the cell, it moves through it in a very organized way. The process occurs rapidly in tissues that have these aquaporins or water channels.","Until 1985, when my lab found the protein they are made of, aquaporins hadn't yet been identified. There had been a controversy in biology for more than 100 years about how water moved through cells.","I grew up in Minnesota. Four generations of my father's people are buried there.","Dad was a chemistry professor at Saint Olaf College in Minnesota, then Oxford College in Minnesota, and a very active member of the American Chemical Society education committee, where he sat on the committee with Linus Pauling, who had authored a very phenomenally important textbook of chemistry.","Well, all life forms are dependent upon water.","Well, my take was people of Minnesota, these are good people. They're in many ways more generous than other parts of the country. They're better educated than other parts of the country.","Mother had to support herself at age 18 because it was during the depression and when my grandfather lost the farm and there was no place for her; she worked as an assistant to a maid.","Often times the public school teachers are ridiculed or they are made to feel inferior but this is really undeserved.","Water is commonly regarded as the 'solvent of life,' since our bodies are 70% water. All other vertebrates, invertebrates, microbes, and plants are also primarily water. The organization of water within biological compartments is fundamental to life, and the aquaporins serve as the plumbing systems for cells.","There are over 50 brilliant scientists working at my lab, and being sensitive to their needs is among the top skill sets that scientists like me have to learn.","For me, the discovery of aquaporins was like a gift after 25 years in basic science.","One of my motivations to become a blood specialist was to study malaria in red blood cells. But in science, you discover something and you want to go this way, but your work goes that way.","My wife and I have four children, and none of them are in lab science, so clearly I returned home at night and presented a fairly unattractive example of a scientific life.","To my knowledge, there's never been a scientist in the U.S. Senate.","There is an anti-science by the far right. We have to be careful that the far left doesn't balance this with a naive approach of promising what we can't deliver. I mean, science is neutral; it's not politically conservative or liberal.","I think there's nothing about evolution in the Bible; I think this is a statement of religious insecurity. But people have their beliefs."],"Peter Akinola":["It is wrong to use equal language for unequal actions.","The Bible says that two cannot walk together unless they are agreed.","We have been filled with grief as we have witnessed the decline of the North American Church that was once filled with missionary zeal and yet now seems determined to bury itself in a deadly embrace with the spirit of the age.","We will not, on the altar of money, mortgage our conscience, mortgage our faith, mortgage our salvation.","We are distressed by the unilateral actions of those provinces that are clearly determined to redefine what our common faith was once.","We are insisting and we will continue to insist that this faith of the church must continue to be upheld come rain, come fire. That is our position."],"Peter Andre":["Divorce isn't just the person, it's everything that goes with it - your kids, the adjustment, everything.","Nobody is going to take my kids away from me and I will fight to the death for that.","I really don't like people that go on about getting followed around, I don't like it - there are people in the industry that don't want to take everything that comes with it. I take it all.","I train for about an hour five days a week and feel I'm in the best shape I've ever been. I can eat what I want and that includes scoffing half a big bar of Cadbury's a day.","You can't go through a divorce and then get back together.","Obviously, the ultimate dream is to be married for life.","I cringe when I watch myself on TV.","So many people know about the dangers of sunbeds but when you have a busy active lifestyle you need a product that you can use quickly and doesn't streak or leave you with orange hands.","When I am tanned and in shape I feel confident about my appearance.","It's so important to encourage the use of suncream, tan in a bottle and the disuse of sunbeds which are known world-wide as causes of skin cancer.","When I do fall in love, I'll go to the ends of the earth for that person. I'd lay down on a carpet of nails for the person I love.","It's amazing how stress keeps you trim.","I hate feet, they're disgusting! What are they even for?","Showing your life so public is a mistake sometimes, but I blame myself as much as anyone else.","What's done is done. You've got to move on. I don't want to say anything bad about the mother of my children.","My kids are my life and the thought of someone taking them away from me is my worst nightmare.","There are certain things I just don't talk about - there are certain things that are private.","Maybe I'm wrong because I've not met the person yet, I really don't think I'd want to be with someone in the industry. I really don't think so. Once bitten, twice shy.","There might come a point where I don't want to be in this industry at all."],"Peter Arnett":["Our reports about civilian casualties here, about the resistance of the Iraqi forces, are going back to the United States. It helps those who oppose the war when you challenge the policy to develop their arguments.","I'd like to say from the beginning that the 12 years I've been coming here, I've met unfailing courtesy and cooperation, courtesy from your people and cooperation from the Ministry of Information.","I am still in shock and awe at being fired.","The first war plan has failed because of Iraqi resistance. Now they are trying to write another war plan. Clearly, the American war planners misjudged the determination of the Iraqi forces.","President Bush says he is concerned about the Iraqi people, but if Iraqi people are dying in numbers, then American policy will be challenged very strongly.","Right-wing media and politicians are looking for any opportunity to be critical of the reporters who are here. Some reporters make judgments, but that is not my style. I present both sides and report what I see with my own eyes."],"Peter Arno":["I consider your conduct unethical and lousy.","Tell me about yourself - your struggles, your dreams, your telephone number."],"Peter Asher":["I am still working with music, but Gordon and I no longer perform together.","I have very much enjoyed being in the music business in different roles through five different decades.","Paul and I don't see that much of each other these days, but I certainly still regard him as a friend.","Shows were very different then - even as the headliner we did a very short set by today's standards and sound systems were really primitive. But the girls made it all worthwhile!","The best music of any era lasts well, I think.","Well, for the reasons I mention above, although I am not sure the live shows were really so brilliant - but nobody could hear much so perhaps it did not matter! It was certainly a very exciting time for us all.","Well, in the sense that we do not tour or record together anymore - then I suppose not. But if our old recordings get heard more we shall be delighted.","Sometimes people's careers take off on their first albums, sometimes they don't.","In any business, the more you learn, the more sympathetic you can be to other people's positions."],"Peter B. Lewis":["I really get a smile that people think they have a right to even suggest how I give my money away. I have no mandate to give a dime to anybody.","Seeing results flow from my gifts is my greatest pleasure as a philanthropist - whether exonerating a jailed innocent or completing a Frank Gehry building. I want to enjoy my philanthropy."],"Peter Banks":["I've had lots of replies, we're into the double figures now. And the overall standard is very good. In fact I've been feeling a little guilty, because I haven't replied to anyone yet - it is something I will be doing.","I've wanted to do it for years, but every attempt at it has turned into another tune. We have actually taken a different approach, we're doing a lot of sampling - we're even sampling bits of Flash!","There's not a moment on it that will sound too familiar, as soon as it sounds comfortably familiar then we like to do something with it to take away that comfortable feeling.","I'm not altogether sure what I'm going to do for that. I think it will be a lot more low key than the other two I've done. Dare I say it, a bit more relaxing."],"Peter Barris":["There's never been a good period of venture capital when prices weren't high.","I couldn't use Nest because it doesn't operate with high-end HVAC systems.","Obviously there are positives to working in the epicenter of innovation. But there are also disadvantages. There is a groupthink mentality that goes on. Being based outside of Silicon Valley, you're not as subject to it.","I started my career at General Electric in a small office under a guy named Greg Liemandt, and his direct boss was Jack Welch. I would say those two have had the most profound impact on my career.","We talk to our partners in Silicon Valley every week, so we have a real sense of what goes on.","I'd love to see the secondary markets become more widespread in terms of their adoption.","We had this unbelievable faith that no business has done, quite frankly, and we tripped along the way doing it, but within two years, we were in 40-plus countries. So we ran at an amazing pace, and this is where venture capitalists play a role. Making Groupon into what it is today, we had no role in it; the entrepreneurs did it.","I had learnt from my years of being in the services business, like networking and closely watching the early days of the Internet, that scale leads to many possibilities.","Risk and failure is a part of our equation, and if you are seeing too little failure, you are actually probably not taking enough risks."],"Peter Bart":["The major media companies are significantly reducing their financial commitment to the motion picture sector.","One of Brando's problems is that he can't have a conversation with anyone.","A green-light meeting is when the decision is made finally whether or not to make a given picture.","Analyses of the movie marketplace points to an interesting phenomenon: High-profile movies are continuing to do well year-to-year in the U.S. and overseas - this past summer, for example, the top 10 movies registered at the same level as in '04.","Historically, filmmakers always fall in love with every frame, but now that even neophytes are given final cut, this love affair carries with it serious economic implications.","Hollywood is going to have to find a way of meeting those profit goals.","I wasn't hanging around the movie theaters in New York where I grew up, a Manhattan brat.","It really hasn't been demonstrated at any level by any major corporation that it can nurture what is euphemistically called creativity.","It's only in relatively recent years that Hollywood became the playground of multinational corporations which regard movies and TV shows as a minor irritant to their overall activity.","Michael Eisner let it be known last week that he had no intention of leaving the entertainment business once he steps down as CEO of Disney in October.","Most movie-goers are overdosing on star coverage; it's the ultimate example of too much information.","Study the public behavior of top stars and you can detect a keen attentiveness to brand value.","Substantially fewer films will be produced over the next year or two. And a significant portion of the production costs of the reduced slate will be borne by hedge funds and other investment groups.","That's how you get surprises, because what movies are all about is surprises.","The biggest danger of Hollywood becoming a purely corporate town resides in the creative process.","The green-light decision process today consists of maybe of 30 or 40 people.","The green-light meeting, when I first started at Paramount, would consist of maybe three or four of us in a room. Perhaps two or three of us would have read the script under discussion.","The model today is that as much as 70 percent of the financing of the picture would come from overseas. Now we're beginning to run out of suckers, because there are not that many people overseas who are willing to put up more than half the money for a movie.","Though gay lifestyles have certainly moved into the open, there's little evidence that society has become more open in its basic attitudes or that entertainers should feel cozy in emerging from the velvet underground.","We're going to see a very, very commercial kind of picture-making."],"Peter Baynham":["People complain that joking about serious subjects is 'making light' of them. Isn't that a good idea? Comedy lets the air out of the bully's tires.","I'm nostalgic for the future I knew as a kid. Back then, it was a lovely, bleepy, heavenly land populated by svelte men in white polo necks, who would lounge on big white sofas sipping blue wine from big glass globes, beside women like the ones on the covers of Hedkandi chill out compilations.","It feels quite cool, in a mad way, to be someone who skulks about in the shadows.","I have no disagreement with the aims of anti-vivisectionists.","I'm the only comedian qualified to navigate a supertanker.","The redemption plot is one of the oldest story shapes.","I have always been against cruelty to animals and remain so.","So many Christmas films either are twee, or try and go super edgy, then stick on something Christmassy at the end of the movie.","It's a fairly common phenomenon of London life - people having fully developed critiques of books they haven't read and films they haven't seen. I'd probably include myself in that.","People sort of imagine Chris Morris and me sitting somewhere dark, with dripping taps and chilling background music. In fact, we like to sit on his roof in the sunshine - and there's an endless amount of just sitting there, going, 'So, erm, er, what shall we do?'","First and foremost, I just want to write comedy.","In 2001, my father finally succumbed to the bone cancer that had tortured him for seven years. His last weeks were a terrible, black icing on the cake, the agony, the slow twisting, thinning and snapping of his skeleton. Everything fell apart.","No subject is unsuitable for comedy.","In life, comedy occurs naturally, as it should, in the most appalling of circumstances.","I was a pedantic child. I'd get really annoyed at the logic of small things that don't bother anyone else.","Christmas movies, it's a hard thing to do. The danger is you just end up with a Hollywood star with a Santa beard. You risk it being fake and cheesy and not real.","Innovations, instantly followed by a demented lust for them, now arrive with dizzying speed, not just daily, but in one-hour delivery slots.","We're chipping away at our capacity for wonder. When hologram TVs eventually go on sale, they'll cost £20,000 and be bought only by those strange, heroic, friendless men who live in flats piled high with giant 80s mobiles and DVD players weighing eight stone.","The future's come and gone; it's a thing of the past. That once impossibly exotic expression 'the year 2000,' for so long evocative of silver suits and robots in pinnies, now feels antiquated."],"Peter Beard":["I'm an escapist. I'm not a planner; I've never made a decision about anything in my life. The good thing about Africa is that you can escape forever. You can do what you want without someone looking over your shoulder.","The last thing left in nature is the beauty of women.","Conservation is for guilty people on Park Avenue with poodles and Pekingeses.","I graduated. I did History of Art, you know, all those things - American Studies - and then I went to art school, and I did Joseph Alvarez in the art school.","It's such a waste, sleep. You're just lying there.","The institution of marriage should be re-examined because of its overwhelming claustrophobia. The odds are stacked against spontaneity and effervescence. It's an institution that was brought about for the sake of family and children, but biologically, it's very unnatural. It's masochism and torture the way it's been organized.","I don't mind the word 'dilettante.' A dilettante means someone who does what he loves.","I made a life for myself in Africa that was as far as you could possibly get from art school at Yale.","An artist who goes around proclaiming that the art he's making is art is probably making a serious mistake. And that's one mistake I try not to make.","I did have a very advanced grandmother, my mother's mother, who wanted to buy me a camera. My parents wouldn't let her. Eventually she won, and I got a camera in about 1948, a Voigtlander.","I'm for conservation, but it's mostly a con. That's the trouble. It's sentimental. Buy an elephant a drink, a lion an acre.","I didn't feel the tusk go through me. But I did feel this sort of freight elevator coming down, popping the chicken bones, you know. It blinded me. Everything was black. It was bright noon day sun. You mustn't get walked on by elephants.","My family was never happy with me. I could just say that across the board.","Life is just a flick of the fingers. Let's face it. And any little bit - you can expand it or enrich it, I think you want to push that and do it.","I've never had underwear of any kind, anything that you have to wash.","In New York, I live on a compost heap of all the stuff I accumulate.","We're adding a billion people every decade. We're just spin doctors. Whatever we do is supposedly great, and yet it's always at the expense of diversity and nature. We're like elephants. The ecology of the elephant is more similar to human than any other.","I was extremely irritated being photographed for a long time, then I gave up caring. Photography is a nauseating cliche, but there is a lot to it. You can tell so much about a person from it. You are exaggerating the consciousness. It's life-thickening, photography.","Elephants are like humans. They are very smart, very logical.","I'm learning that human pressure on wildlife is becoming increasingly dangerous. You've got to be more alert because more animals have been pushed around, wounded, subjected to human harassment, ambushed, all kinds of stress. When they attack, it's totally predictable.","I've never gotten a release from any person. I'm not a businessman; I'm on the side of common sense. Releases ruin the atmosphere of photography.","In the high level cartoon world, my number one admired hero would be Chas Addams - really a top, top artist that the 'New Yorker' was lucky to find and employ."],"Peter Benchley":["If we choose to walk into a forest where a tiger lives, we are taking a chance. If we swim in a river where crocodiles live, we are taking a chance. If we visit the desert or climb a mountain or enter a swamp where snakes have managed to survive, we are taking a chance.","We provoke a shark every time we enter the water where sharks happen to be, for we forget: The ocean is not our territory - it's theirs.","It is not that I don't have a fear of sharks, it is that I have a respect for them, so that I know any more than if I were to go into the jungle, I would have a fear of tigers, that I would try to lower the odds.","I don't think there's such a thing as an unprovoked shark attack.","I dive as much as I can.","I believe implicitly that every young man in the world is fascinated with either sharks or dinosaurs.","Sharks don't target human beings, and they certainly don't hold grudges.","If man doesn't learn to treat the oceans and the rain forest with respect, man will become extinct.","Without the oceans there would be no life on Earth.","Almost any shark, three or four feet long, could kill a human being if it chose to do it. It could make you bleed to death. But they don't.","Fascinations breeds preparedness, and preparedness, survival.","We should be afraid of sharks half as much as sharks should be afraid of us.","There was a minor burst of macho nuttiness after 'Jaws' came out, in which people would go off in shark tournaments and come back holding the bloody heads of these animals and say, 'Look what I did.' But they've been doing that for hundreds of thousands of years anyway.","A human being is still more likely to die of a bee sting, snake bite or, Lord knows, automobile accident than by shark attack. We do not execute the perpretrators of death by car. We should not butcher an animal for an inadvertent homicide.","Without sharks, you take away the apex predator of the ocean, and you destroy the entire food chain.","We do not just fear our predators, we are transfixed by them. We are prone to weave stories and fables and chat endlessly about them.","Writing is sweat and drudgery most of the time. And you have to love it in order to endure the solitude and the discipline.","Because the Asian market is so omnivorous, it affects all the shark populations up and down the Central and South American coast, and to a certain extent the East Coast of the United States as well.","In a deeply tribal sense, we love our monsters, and I think that is the key to it right there. It is monsters; it is learning about them: it is both thrill and safety. You can think of them without being desperately afraid because they are not going to come into your living room and eat you. That is 'Jaws.'","If you take away the predators in the prairies and the national parks, you suddenly have an explosion of elk, and then you have a lack of the food source for the elk, so they strip all the ground bare and that takes away the cover, on and on and on and on. The whole food chain is disrupted.","I hope that 'Jaws' will have brought sharks into the public interest at a time when we desperately need to reevaluate our care for the environment.","Twenty-five years ago nobody knew much about white sharks.","I read very widely, both non-fiction and fiction, so I don't think there's a single writer who influences me.","Reputations rise and fall almost as regularly as the tides.","I don't believe in blaming inanimate objects for anything.","I'm a babe in the woods when it comes to the Internet.","I guess I'm a hopeful optimist, because to be a pessimist is to be suicidal.","Since writing JAWS, I've been lucky enough to do close to forty television shows about wildlife in the oceans, and yes, I have been attacked by sea creatures once in a while.","I've never been hurt by a sea creature, except for jellyfish and sea urchins.","I didn't invent the fear of sharks; it's as old as mankind, and that - to take that responsibility would mean that Mario Puzo should take the blame for the Mafia.","If you're young and wild, you tend to believe your clippings. One day you're Hemingway. The next day you're nothing.","It's hard to care deeply for something that might turn on you and eat you.","We are already perilously close to killing off the top of the oceanic food chain - with catastrophic consequences that we can't begin to imagine. Let us not, in the heat of anger, reduce the already devastated population of great white sharks by one more member.","Ideas for stories come to me based on my life, so who knows? If somebody sends me to become an astronaut, that's what I'll end up writing.","Everything I've written is based on something that has happened to me or something that I know a great deal about."],"Peter Benenson":["The candle burns not for us, but for all those whom we failed to rescue from prison, who were shot on the way to prison, who were tortured, who were kidnapped, who 'disappeared'. That's what the candle is for.","Torture is banned but in two-thirds of the world's countries it is still being committed in secret. Too many governments still allow wrongful imprisonment, murder or 'disappearance' to be carried out by their officials with impunity.","Those who today still feel a sense of impotence can do something: they can support Amnesty International. They can help it to stand up for freedom and justice.","It's the publicity function of Amnesty that I think has made its name so widely known, not only to readers in the world, but to governments - and that's what matters.","Open your newspaper - any day of the week - and you will find a report from somewhere in the world of someone being imprisoned, tortured or executed because his opinions or religion are unacceptable to his government."],"Peter Berg":["I wanted to do a naval film and I flirted with different ideas, most of which ended up being too intense. So when the idea of 'Battleship' was first suggested, I was instantly drawn to the challenge - could I invent a movie around the idea of five ships fighting five ships?","The big fun in 'Battleship' is that there are no current battleships in the Navy today. The battleships are about 1,000 feet long and they have huge guns. They were what you saw in WWII. The last battleship that was used was the Missouri, which is what the Japanese surrendered to.","Young kids should probably not play tackle football. I know this intellectually, but emotionally, I'm conflicted. I love this sport. I grew up playing and adoring football. I love the brotherhood, teamwork, athletic grace that borders on superhuman, grit, pressure and, yes, contact. I love the contact.","Boxing is not always about standing in the middle going toe to toe. It's about poise and grace under extreme pressure.","I've had great success and I've had catastrophic failure. It's really how you handle the rough stuff that defines you, I think.","I don't like alien films where you don't get to see the aliens.","When I look back at it, I'm mostly amazed at how poorly it was shot. David Kelley is a great writer, and I thought the scripts were great, but it just looks so cheap.","Then they started pulling me in and I was very resistant. All the other actors would be saying write more, more dialogue for me, and I'd always be saying 'No, less, less'.","You might make a lot of money, but it's very hard to get out from under that rug. The more you can reinvent yourself, the better - and unfortunately TV is designed not to let you redesign yourself.","There's a picture of the real Coach Gary Gaines in the book and he's sitting in the locker room after a game, and he just looks so much like Billy Bob, that we went to him.","Truth is, we offered it to Tom Hanks, which pretty much every movie in America does, but Tom passed. Billy Bob said that Hanks recently called and said he's voting for all of us for Oscars, he loved the film.","It's always an interesting sort of adventures that gets someone into a movie.","Michael Mann's always been one of my heroes.","What kind of town do we want in the future, and how are we going to plan on that?","People know I love to shoot action and that I'm not afraid of emotion.","I'm pretty upfront about my love and admiration for the military. One of the perks of making movies is that you get to sort of follow your own passions, and I believe quite passionately that we don't pay enough attention and respect to our veterans. Not just our wounded veterans, but all veterans.","I've spent enough time with soldiers to know that once they get to know you and they loosen up and become themselves, they are some of the biggest hams and most charismatic, cocky, fun, humorous guys I've ever met.","I think musicians oftentimes have the right skill set to be good actors. And with Rihanna, I noticed her and knew of her obviously, and was very taken with her charisma and her confidence.","I've been a big believer in musicians turned actor, going back to Sinatra winning the Oscar for 'From Here To Eternity.' David Bowie in 'Man Who Fell to Earth,' Kris Kristofferson's been great in a bunch of films. Liza Minnelli, Barbra Streisand, Mariah Carey, I thought was great in 'Precious.'","I had great luck with Tim McGraw twice in 'Friday Night Lights' and 'The Kingdom.' I love finding off-beat casting and finding someone you know in one way and you reinvent them in another way. I like doing that as a director.","What first caught my eye about Rihanna was an interview she did with Diane Sawyer after the Chris Brown incident, where she was very articulate, very poised, obviously a smart girl who talked about a very traumatic experience.","You know to me, being a good actor, the most important quality is you've got to love to play, and to just be open to anything.","I did not want 'Battleship' to be perceived as an American war film. I wanted to do everything I could to make the film accessible to a global audience. It felt like bringing an alien component to the film would help take the American jingoism out of it.","I somewhere along the way became fascinated with exploring characters who are willing to put themselves into violent situations, whether it's football, hockey, boxing, being a cop, being a soldier. There's not a lot of people who are willing to put themselves into those situations.","I believe that anything in this world is fair game for a creative exercise.","The first movie I literally ever made in my life was about two guys playing Stratego with each other. I had all my friends dressing up like the military characters in the game. So 'Battleship' is really my second board game turned movie!","I'm a huge fan of the Navy. My father was a Naval historian, and I've been studying Naval battles forever.","Before boxing, I was this angry kid ready to fight if someone said, 'Hello.'","I'm a patriot. I admire our military, their character, code of honor, belief systems.","I love actors. I'm empathetic to them. I understand what they go through. But I didn't want to be an actor.","I don't go to a lot of other directors' sets; directors don't come to mine. Directors are all very cordial with each other, but they're not necessarily friendly.","When I started making films, like almost every filmmaker, I think, you're just so excited to be able to make a movie that you'll do anything.","Some directors want to make superhero films. That's what gets them off, and they love it, and they love sci-fi. I prefer putting my hands into non-fiction.","I'm definitely drawn to stories of just regular folks, just generally in some kind of horrific situation. I keep saying I want to do a love story in the south of France with a boy and girl and some wine. Then I always end up in an oil rig with four hundred guys or on a mountain with guys shooting at each other.","Where do you go to buy back your reputation when you lose it?","The SEALs rarely call the Taliban 'terrorists' because they respect them as worthy opponents.","There's a truth to the violence of boxing. You have a very real threat, an opponent.","I've always found boxing to be an incredibly pure sport. The level of character of most fighters I find very high. And it's just the best workout you can get.","I don't want to be knocked out. But the contact and the focus and the energy I get from sparring gives me energy to make movies, energy to be a dad, energy to be a friend, and, you know, makes me feel, probably, a lot younger and behave a lot younger than I am.","If you're a 50-year-old guy, and you're sitting around the house with - you know, and just getting fatter, feeling sorry for yourself, get up and move your body and see what it does to your life and to your mind and to your happiness and to your energy levels. And I get all that from boxing.","I found at a certain point in my acting career that I was just bored. I had too much energy. I had too many ideas.","Head and neck injuries are what parents thinking about letting their children play tackle football should be thinking about, talking about, and demanding answers about, from any coach presenting himself as a worthy custodian for their child's introduction to tackle football.","Young boys must be taught to play football without leading with or lowering their heads. Young players must be drilled over and over and over with Heads Up Football skills until that skill set becomes muscle memory and second nature.","We will play football. We will box and play lacrosse and ice hockey and snowboard and surf and drive fast cars, climb trees, and do dozens of things that we know are potentially concussive. We will do this because we are human and animals, and we like speed and contact and aggressive maneuvering and all such things.","For me, concussion response is pure common sense. We can all probably handle a few mild concussions. I have had at least three, and despite my detractors' opinions, I am mentally and physically fine.","Life is, and should be, a little hard. Getting punched in the face or getting an occasional concussion will probably happen to us all at some point in our lives. We can handle it.","The more you learn about the science of boxing, the more appreciation you have for man's ability to think and perform in violent situations, and that's what interests me in film.","Sweating the small stuff is important in boxing and life. On a movie, we have production assistants who're 18 and 19 years old. If someone asks you for a cup of coffee, and you bring them a cup of coffee that's cold, I make a big deal of that. I make a really, really big deal of that. You have to pay attention to details.","If I could find a way to make a film that takes you into the mind of a fighter, where you have 36 minutes of combat with so many different emotions, so many highs and lows, so many obstacles to overcome, I'd do that.","I grew up during a time of peace, and my friends weren't joining the military - it wasn't something on my radar. But if you asked me whether I could go back and do it all over again now, and it meant I wouldn't go into filmmaking, there's a part of me that would have loved to try to be a Navy SEAL.","Generally, studios are adverse to making films about war in the Middle East. They'd much rather make a film with a superhero or an alien or a robot.","I'm a huge sports fan. I love the psychology of athletes and the culture of athletics. I'm constantly drawn to those kinds of stories.","I don't think about awards when I set out to do something. If that happens, it's great.","Obama really is a warrior in chief. He's not afraid to get the job done.","I was very impressed with Davis Guggenheim's 'An Inconvenient Truth.' He's inspired me as one of the newer, cutting-edge documentary filmmakers. I see those films, and I'm just instinctively drawn to them."],"Peter Bergen":["Incompetence is a better explanation than conspiracy in most human activity.","It's much harder to detect a lone wolf than it is somebody who's associated with a larger organization who's having planning meetings and making phone calls to people in the organization. And so that is really how the jihad has really developed in the United States.","The documentary feature film 'Legion of Brothers' tells the stories of the handful of U.S. Special Forces soldiers who, shortly after the 9/11 attacks, went into Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and, within a matter of weeks, overthrew the Taliban regime.","The 9/11 attack itself played out around the world, with planning meetings in Malaysia, operatives taking flight lessons in the United States, coordination by plot leaders based in Hamburg, and money transfers from Dubai - activities overseen by al-Qaeda's senior command from secure bases in Afghanistan.","When news of the first plane's hitting the World Trade Center reached them, bin Laden's followers exploded with joy. But shrewder members of al-Qaeda and the Taliban leadership in Afghanistan realized that the attacks might not be the stunning victory that bin Laden, and many in the West, took them to be.","Anne Richard, a senior U.S. State Department official, testified at a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing in November 2015 that any Syrian refugee trying to get into the United States is scrutinized by officials from the National Counterterrorism Center, FBI, Department of Homeland Security, State Department and Pentagon.","In late May 2016, an ISIS spokesman called for attacks in the West during the month of Ramadan.","Bin Laden studied economics and public administration before he turned to a life of jihad.","Hydrogen peroxide-based bombs were used in the London bombings in 2005; in al Qaeda's foiled plot to attack subways in New York City in 2009 and also in the ISIS-directed Paris attacks in 2015 and the ISIS-directed attacks in Brussels a year later.","Bin Laden's role in the war against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s had made him a hero around the Middle East.","More than a decade and half after 9/11, U.S. military actions in countries such as Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan and several other Muslim nations are governed by the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) that was passed in the days immediately after 9/11.","Bin Laden was intelligent, well-informed, and low key. The people around him treated him with great deference, calling him 'sheikh,' a term of respect.","If the Arab Spring was a large nail in the coffin of al-Qaeda's ideology, the death of bin Laden was an equally large nail in the coffin of al-Qaeda the organization.","It is hard to imagine two more final endings to the 'war on terror' than the popular revolts against the authoritarian regimes in the Middle East and the death of bin Laden.","The money that bin Laden inherited was about 20 million dollars over the course of many years, not the much larger sums some have suggested. In 1994, his family cut him off.","Sanctions on Pakistan have been part of the troubled U.S.-Pakistan relationship in the past and should not be considered as an option in the future.","One of the themes of 'The Longest War,' my book, which came out before the Arab spring happened, was how al-Qaida and bin Laden was losing the war of ideas in the Muslim world, not because the United States was winning them, but because al-Qaida was simply losing them.","The thing that's very puzzling to somebody who's been in Pakistan repeatedly since 1983 is lots of people live in compounds with high walls in Pakistan. I mean, that's so completely routine. In fact, you know, it would be un-routine to have the reverse.","9/11 was a sort of hinge event in American history, and all jihadi terrorist plots or attacks are kind of filtered through that lens.","Abu Musab al-Suri is someone I got to know pretty well because he's a Syrian. Very bright guy, lived in London. He actually was the person who took myself and correspondent Peter Arnett and the cameraman, Peter Juvenal, to interview bin Laden for his first TV interview.","If a parent knows that their kid is suddenly becoming infatuated with ISIS, they face a very difficult choice, which is, you know, do I - what do I do?","There are all sorts of despicable people who journalists have done interviews with, and it's been useful. Isn't more information better than less information?","The commonly accepted definition of terrorism is that it is politically motivated violence directed at civilians by entities other than a state. These kind of attacks can come from the far right, the far left, racists of every stripe, as well as jihadists.","The reason that attacks by American terrorists who are not jihadist militants are sometimes not called 'terrorism' is, in part, because in the United States, terrorism is a crime which has to be in some way be associated with a 'designated' terrorist group such as ISIS.","Because of the 9/11 attacks, the framing of terrorism by politicians, the media, and the public too often in the past decade and a half has been that it is Islamist political violence that is the terrorism we need to be concerned about.","Typically, terrorist attacks produce a rally-around-the flag effect as was the case after 9/11 and the huge outpouring of public support that then-President George W. Bush garnered.","Will there be a political backlash against British Prime Minister Theresa May, whose ruling Conservative Party is traditionally seen as 'stronger' on terrorism than its main rival, the Labour Party?","The sitting prime minister, Jose Aznar, who had strongly backed the U.S.-led Iraq War, was unseated by a challenger who then pulled Spanish troops out of Iraq. The Madrid terrorist attacks are generally regarded as being the key to why Aznar, who had been leading in the polls, was defeated.","The hard reality is that attacks by vehicles in public places are very hard to defend against in a free and open society. The best defense against such attacks is good intelligence, and that often comes from inside the Muslim community.","Mateen pledged allegiance to ISIS during his attack, the worst terror attack on American soil since 9/11.","Security services, from Afghanistan to the United States, should be alert throughout the Ramadan period, but especially on the 27th day of the holy month.","Because 9/11 was carried out by 19 foreign-born Arab hijackers, many assume that all terrorists who attack the West are foreigners.","Again and again since 9/11, terror attacks in the West have been carried out by second-generation Muslims who are citizens of the very country they are attacking.","Abedi appears to be one of the many thousands of Western Muslims who have embraced militant Islam, often as a way of trying to resolve the tension between their split identities.","When ISIS and al Qaeda have attacked or plotted attacks in the West in the past decade or so, they have invariably used hydrogen peroxide-based bombs because acquiring military-grade explosives or dynamite is nearly impossible for would-be terrorists in Western countries.","In one notorious episode in 2002, in the holy city of Mecca, the religious police prevented girls from fleeing a school that was on fire because they were not properly dressed.","Candidate Trump had previously opined that 'Islam hates us' and had called for 'the total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,' an argument he has since modified and moderated.","In the public's mind, Special Forces are often confused with the 'door kickers' of Special Operations Forces - such as SEAL Team 6 and Delta Force - who are the United States' elite counterterrorism operators.","In mid-November 2001, as they moved toward the city of Kandahar, the Taliban's de facto capital in southern Afghanistan, Amerine's team called in airstrikes against advancing Taliban units and more or less obliterated a Taliban column of a thousand men that had been dispatched from Kandahar. It was the Taliban's final play to remain in power.","The Green Berets of U.S. Special Forces 5th Group - known as 'the Legion' - who led the anti-Taliban campaign represent a textbook case of a successful Special Forces campaign.","A decade and a half ago, the U.S. Air Force dropped massive 15,000-pound 'Daisy Cutter' bombs on the Tora Bora complex where Osama bin Laden was hiding in December 2001.","It is in American and Afghan interests for the U.S. to stay in Afghanistan so it doesn't turn into Iraq circa 2014, with the Taliban controlling much of the country while hosting a strong presence of ISIS and al-Qaeda as well as every other jihadist group of note.","Officials in the George W. Bush administration later criticized the cruise missile strikes that were ordered by President Bill Clinton in Afghanistan in 1998 as only 'pounding sand.'","On the campaign trail, candidate Trump occasionally raised the idea of creating 'safe zones' for Syrian civilians.","Assad owes his continuation in power to the intervention of Russia in 2015 to prop up his regime.","The Trump administration launched the cruise missile strikes in Syria, an act of war, without a U.N. resolution or Congressional authorization.","In 1999, NATO did impose a no-fly zone in Kosovo without seeking a U.N. resolution to carry out air strikes on Serbian forces.","Both China and Russia felt duped by the U.N. 'no-fly' zone resolution regarding Libya in 2011 that eventually led to the ouster of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi. China and Russia had abstained from the Libyan resolution, and neither country plans to make what they regard as a similar mistake again.","Bannon should never have had a permanent seat on the NSC, as he is a political operative, and the NSC has traditionally been a place where American interests are considered rather than narrow Republican or Democratic interests.","An intelligence officer and historian, Rayburn published a 2014 book, 'Iraq After America,' which is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand how Iraq descended into chaos in the years after the American troop withdrawal at the end of 2011.","The senior director at the NSC for the Middle East is retired Col. Derek Harvey, an Arabic-speaking intelligence officer with a Ph.D. who served as the head of the U.S. military cell examining the insurgency in Iraq in 2003.","When it comes to the greater Middle East, McMaster brings to the table his own deep knowledge of Iraq and Afghanistan, countries where he served for many years.","In February 2016, Russia arrested seven alleged ISIS militants who were plotting attacks in St. Petersburg and Moscow. The group included Russians and Central Asians and a ringleader who had come from Turkey.","ISIS despises the Russian government for its support of the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, and so it's no surprise that ISIS began targeting Russia in 2015, around the same time that Russia first intervened in the Syrian civil war.","The Russians have been waging wars with these separatists since the 19th century, but for obvious reasons, Chechen separatist terrorism tends to be carried out by Chechens.","Western Mosul is the historic heart of one of the oldest cities in the world. Its narrow streets and alleyways are impassable for armored vehicles.","The Turkish government will never tolerate the creation of a Kurdish state.","Compounding Iraq's problem is that its economy is highly dependent on oil.","A little exposure to a city like Sulaimani will help Trump understand that the Middle East is a much more complex place than he seems to believe. Perhaps Trump could even give a speech at the American University in Sulaimani, just as President Obama did at Cairo University early in his first term.","On November 28, 2016, Abdul Razak Ali Artan, an 18-year-old legal resident of the United States whose family was originally from Somalia, used a car to mow down a group of people at the Ohio State University.","Using vehicles as weapons is a tactic that has often used by Palestinian terrorists to target Israelis, but in 2014, an ISIS spokesman had encouraged such vehicular attacks in the West, saying of ISIS' enemies, 'Run him over with your car.'","McMaster, 54, is the smartest and most capable military officer of his generation, one who has not only led American victories on the battlefields of the 1991 Gulf War and of the Iraq War, but also holds a Ph.D. in history.","A key to McMaster's thinking is his 1997 book, 'Dereliction of Duty: Lyndon Johnson, Robert McNamara, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Lies that Led to Vietnam.'","The Sunni militants that make up ISIS are not the underlying problem in Syria and Iraq, but rather they are a symptom of other deeper problems.","Sheikh Rahman's fatwa was the first time that anyone associated with al Qaeda had given religious sanction to attacks on American aviation, shipping and economic targets.","Sheikh Rahman had a doctorate in Islamic jurisprudence from al-Azhar University in Cairo, the Harvard of Islamic thought. He also had a long history of guiding terrorist groups.","The special reverence that al Qaeda had for Sheikh Rahman was underlined by a two-hour propaganda videotape that the group's media division released in the spring of 2001, when the 9/11 attacks were in their final planning phase.","The American incarceration of Sheikh Rahman was a hot-button issue for al Qaeda for many years.","Ground operations are inherently very risky in Yemen. The two previous JSOC raids in Yemen were both in 2014.","In the past, Joint Special Operations Command, or JSOC, of which SEAL Team 6 is a key component, has only launched ground raids in Yemen when the lives of hostages held by al Qaeda seemed at risk.","The only lethal terrorist to immigrate to the United States as an adult and conduct an attack shortly after arriving is Tashfeen Malik, who was born in Pakistan.","Mohammed Taheri-Azar, a naturalized U.S. citizen hailing from Iran, crashed his SUV into a crowd at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2006, injuring nine people.","Donald Trump's own mother Mary escaped the bone-crushing poverty of Scotland's remote Outer Hebrides for the promise of New York in 1929.","America has not traditionally been the cramped, frightened country of Trump's executive order that bans Syrian refugees.","Syrian refugees fleeing to Europe do not go through anything like the rigorous process experienced by those who are coming to the States, and the volume of Syrians fleeing to Europe is orders of magnitude larger than it is to the United States.","In Yemen, the United States conducted more drone strikes in 2016 than any year except 2012, the peak of the campaign in the country, according to data collected by New America.","In 2016, Washington and its coalition partners conducted more than 7,000 strikes in Iraq and Syria. And in Libya, the United States has conducted more than 350 air strikes since August as part of its military campaign against ISIS there.","'Zero Dark Thirty' is a great piece of filmmaking and does a valuable public service by raising difficult questions most Hollywood movies shy away from, but as of this writing, it seems that one of its central themes - that torture was instrumental to tracking down bin Laden - is not supported by the facts.","When Abu Zubaydah was shown a series of photos of al Qaeda members by Soufan, he identified one of them as the operational commander of 9/11, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.","Between November 23, 2002, and January 11, 2003, al-Qahtani was interrogated for 48 days at Guantanamo more or less continuously, kept awake for much of that time by loud music being blasted when he was falling asleep, doused with water and subjected to cold temperatures, kept naked and forced to perform tricks as if he were a dog.","Bin Laden had come to the delusional conclusion that the United States was as weak as the Soviet Union had once been.","Before 9/11, al-Qaeda was an organization of global reach.","My quest to meet Osama bin Laden began in North London early in 1997. In the Dollis Hill section, I contacted Khaled al-Fauwaz, the spokesman for a Saudi opposition group, the Advice and Reformation Committee, which bin Laden had founded.","Afghanistan's winters in the north are legendarily harsh, and southern Afghanistan, by contrast, is bleak desert. These difficulties are compounded by the fact that Afghanistan is one of the world's most heavily mined countries.","As early as 1993, members of bin Laden's group had been planning an attack on the American Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya.","Contrary to what the Americans frequently reiterated, al-Qaeda did not have any relationship with Saddam Hussein or his regime.","What bin Laden had hoped to achieve in Afghanistan in the post-9/11 period, which was to drag the United States into a protracted guerrilla war like the one he had fought against the Soviets, never happened. Instead, that protracted guerrilla war is now playing out in Iraq, in the heart of the Middle East.","Al-Qaeda, which means 'the base' in English, lost its base and training camps in Afghanistan, while its leaders were on the run, captured, or dead. One year after the 9/11 attacks, al-Qaeda was still on life support.","As Michael Scheuer, who ran the C.I.A.'s bin Laden unit until 1999, has pointed out, if bin Laden believed in Christmas, the Iraq war would be his perfect present from Santa Claus. The 9/11 attacks and the subsequent war in Afghanistan severely damaged bin Laden's organization."],"Peter Bergman":["When my daughter, Clare, was 4, she told me that a school friend had told her what I did for a living. Clare asked me, 'Is it true you play Jack Rabbit?'","She said, and I'm not kidding, 'Is this a speaking role?' I wasn't quite sure how to answer that one.","We lived in the bowels of New York City. It was a struggle just to survive. This nice suburban kid hadn't had to do much of that before.","When you are not practicing, remember somewhere someone is practicing, and when you meet him, he will win.","I do like large entrances, but this was a little too large."],"Peter Bichsel":["Writers let themselves be enticed by the language.","Why does one always ask a writer why they stopped? I am sure everyone finds in any drawer a few dear poems.","The problems of our country are very fast to recognize.","That is a secondary teacher conception - the writer as an observer.","Only that Swiss in the heart want still a king or at least a strong Upper House of Parliament. Swiss long themselves for less democracy and more dictatorship.","Literature is about as unnecessarily necessarily as tableware or ironed shirts.","It is strange, how quickly people want to obligate their poets, as it were, on the exile.","I was convinced that the world was in the departure and paging.","I wanted to write a novel. At 12 I knew, I am a writer. I said it to nobody."],"Peter Billingsley":["When I was a kid, I really wanted a metal detector for Christmas, convinced I was going to find buried treasure and could retire at 12. Santa Claus brought me one, but sadly, that treasure was never realized. It's amazing how many bottle caps you have to dig up. But to be honest, that dream is still alive.","When the St. Louis Cardinals arrived in Arizona as the Phoenix Cardinals, I became a fan and still am today.","You have to pace yourself. As a producer, you start with a concept and shepherd it through the script to the delivery of the film. It's a very long journey for an hour and 40 minutes of movie.","'A Christmas Story' has always meant a lot to me personally.","I think good comedy is a commitment to the absurd in that the situation for the actors should be virtually played like a drama.","I think if you turn down the volume on the good comedy, you should not even know if it's a comedy or not. It should look like a drama.","I've had a nontabloid life because I had a really good family.","I only get involved with projects as a producer if I feel creatively inspired.","A lot of people don't like child actors.","I have already done two Christmas films: 'Elf' and 'Four Christmases.' I guess I really am a sucker for Christmas. Both movies are really about the importance of family. I come from a brood of five kids, and it's the one time of year we can all get together. It's hands-down my favorite holiday.","I had brothers and sisters and did chores and had to pick up the dog crap in the yard and mow the lawn and do all the normal things that kids have to do.","I guess I've always had a similar-looking face.","It is important to me that I was not raised in Los Angeles.","Why would you want to remake a movie that has endured for more than 25 years?","People will still recognize me and say, 'You'll shoot your eye out!'","I've been really lucky in that I've been able to work so much, and pretty much everything I've done has been really great fun.","It's a rare film that has staying power. 'A Christmas Story' is not just a funny movie but something that connects with people.","'A Christmas Story' has become such a special part of the holiday season for so many families.","It's nice to be known for a pretty great movie.","I got to Arizona in 1980, before the Cardinals, Diamondbacks and Coyotes. The sun rose and set with the Phoenix Suns, and it wasn't very spectacular. But I became a loyal fan and went to a lot of games.","Guys like Alvin Adams, Sweet D Walter Davis, Larry Nance, and Kyle Macy became my basketball heroes.","I'm a big watcher of sports, consumer of sports content, so I love documentaries; I love the format.","You're going to spend a long time with the stuff you work on; you might as well like it.","I've always been self-motivated, but I can't take a ton of credit for any success I've had.","It's a difficult world for lots of child actors, and it's difficult to be a teenager under any circumstances. Add to that notoriety and fame, and things can go really wrong. But I had a terrific family and grew up very normal in Phoenix.","An actor can come in with a specific energy and get it on film over several days or weeks, but as the producer, I'm responsible for the overall trajectory of the project.","I'm generally not a fan of remaking great films.","When you're a child actor and play the precocious kid, the temptation is to wear leather pants or a cutoff shirt to redefine yourself. But I never felt the need to randomly reshuffle the deck and say, 'Don't call me Peter. Call me Pete.' I just figured you evolve naturally, and you'll be recognized for what your successes are.","When I first heard 'A Christmas Story, the musical,' I thought, Oh, that could be really good. It just felt like it fit. Some films lend themselves well to other formats, some don't, but there are so many fantasy sequences in the film, and Ralphie's such a dreamer as a character, I thought they could really lend themselves to being set pieces.","I was sleeping on editing room floors for $300 a week.","I think you always win in storytelling when you let the best creative ideas guide you.","I stopped acting a long time ago and my primary career has been producing-directing film.","When you're involved in those big-budget movies, there's a lot of hype: 'Oh this is gonna be a big hit!' And 'A Christmas Story' wasn't. It came and went and was a big disappointment at the box office."],"Peter Blair Henry":["Good economic policy requires not so much the bravado to implement drastic change as the strength and wisdom to make reasonable trade-offs over the many years it takes to transform a country's standard of living.","Just as an individual's ability to delay gratification at a young age is a powerful predictor of future academic and professional achievement, discipline is also central to the long-run economic health of nations.","I think my wife would take objection to any characterization of me as perfect.","I was born in Jamaica but was educated by, and now serve, prestigious First World institutions, so I believe that I have a unique, dual perspective. To sidestep any biases I might have, I use the objective lens of the stock market to discover which policies actually delivered prosperity to emerging markets.","Disciplined governments do not engage in the economic equivalent of binge eating followed by crash dieting.","Economic growth creates jobs, and countries grow when they educate their people and pursue policies that encourage households to save, existing businesses to invest, and entrepreneurs to innovate and create new markets.","I think that whether you're on the right or on the left as an economist or as a policy maker, every serious analyst I know agrees that at some point you have to deal with entitlements.","Because I come from a place like Jamaica, which is a small, open economy, I viscerally get the importance of the global economy.","Business is one of the most powerful institutions on Earth for creating wealth and opportunity and helping to lift people out of poverty. When you think about it that way, then business is not separate from development policy.","I'm generally slow to anger, quick to forgive, and I take in information before making decisions. So no matter how controversial the decision, my general demeanour is to put on white lab coat and gloves and look at the evidence, weigh the arguments and see what makes sense.","As an economist, I'm aware that life is full of trade offs.","Between 2001 and 2011, Brazil lifted 20 million people out of poverty and into its growing middle class, and in the last quarter of the twentieth century Botswana's gross domestic product per capita grew faster than that of any other country on the planet. The once-labeled 'Third World' is edging its way into the 'First World.'","A government decision that slashes spending at the wrong time and sends a weak economy into a tailspin can be just as undisciplined as one that unleashes a wasteful spending spree in an overheated environment.","You can actually make a lot of money and do a lot of good in the world. I don't see those things as being in opposition to one another. I never have.","In Jamaica, you're never very far away from people who don't have very much, and in Wilmette, pretty much everybody had a lot.","It's probably indicative that I was destined for an academic career that I'm 6-5 and I lost the slam-dunk championship to somebody 5-8. I was a lot better at math.","Fear of foreign domination in India led the Janata Party, in the 1970s, to push for partial Indian ownership of all multinational firms within the country. The result was a spectacular pullback, by companies such as IBM and Coca-Cola, and a stagnant economy."],"Peter Bofinger":["Germany would be the biggest loser in a euro breakup.","Germany is not like Ireland or Denmark. It is a country where the domestic market counts much more than the external market.","One needs a comprehensive concept that decides just how much debt states like Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy can sustainably bear.","I don't expect to get a standing ovation from businessmen when I call for higher wages.","The uncontrolled increase of the euro rate vis-a-vis the dollar threatens employment growth in the euro area.","It is true that a population which is growing older needs to save, but the question is in what form the savings are made."],"Peter Bogdanovich":["One of the things that wrong with pictures today, I think, is that so many of the people making them started out wanting to.","But at a certain point, and I don't really know... people have asked me this. I don't know exactly what it was that pushed me towards directing, but I think it was a naive notion that if I directed I would be able to play all the roles. A kind of greed.","The actors are in control, getting outrageous amounts of money. The reason they're getting this kind of money is because the studios don't know what else to do. They don't have a clue about what to do except to pay an actor a lot of money.","You see so many movies... the younger people who are coming from MTV or who are coming from commercials and there's no sense of film grammar. There's no real sense of how to tell a story visually. It's just cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, you know, which is pretty easy."],"Peter Bondra":["The celebration... you cannot practice it or anything. It's a moment when the excitement of your goal make you react to the moment.","Our team has a lot of talent. I hope that soon we will break out with four or five goals and avoid overtime.","You have to play defense, that's how you win.","Obviously, I have a lot of memories here... but at the same time I'm going to put all my energies into moving forward and doing my best for the Thrashers.","This is definitely a playoff team. There's no question about that. It's just a matter of how much we want it.","I just cannot have an offer on the table and just let it go.","My job is to score goals.","My speed is my greatest asset.","Now I'm kind of different. I'm not saying I lost my spark - I still have it - but I don't chase the goal as much as I used to. I'm playing for the team and I still know I can score, but it's different than two or three years back.","Sometimes that happens. I know how it feels to lose eight or nine to nothing. It can be frustrating but it was good for us. This was a team that was hot the last nine games. It seemed like any puck we touched went our way.","We talked to the referees before the game; there's always new situations to adjust, for the refs and for us as well. Even on the ice, it's good for players to talk and interact with the referee.","We want to learn all the game and play the best way and take to our advantage.","To me, it's like we're already in the playoffs. Every game is important for our position. We can't relax at all.","We're getting rewarded. We don't give up on the play and we show some character at the same time, but there is a long way for us to get to where we want to be."],"Peter Boyle":["Opera? Just what the world needs: more fat women screaming.","I don't think I would be an actor if I was that intelligent.","I like to work for a while, and then do nothing for some period.","In live stage, the actor lives."],"Peter Brimelow":["Hey, nothing grows to the sky. There will be a successor movement. Right now it's nascent.","This type of mass influx is simply too much to handle. What we've had since the disaster of the 1965 Immigration Act will take 100 years or more to absorb.","If you're going to have a public subsidy to education, vouchers are clearly a better way of delivering it. They should result in some loosening up and privatization of the government school system.","I regard many of the neoconservatives as personal friends, but that's not stopped them from behaving with extraordinary viciousness towards those of us who raised the immigration issue.","The problem with K-12 education is socialism and the solution is capitalism.","There's no particular relationship between spending and educational results. Most education spending is actually on salaries, and that's allocated according to political muscle.","Textbook publishers don't even bother to advertise at their conventions.","Teacher unions are an interest group that acts in defense of their own interests, which means the union bosses' interests, not the members.","I think good teachers are underpaid.","Why can't teachers end up owning schools, the way waiters can open their own restaurants?","I think we spend too much on K-12 education a.k.a. teachers' salaries. It's the only industry where you never see any productivity increases.","I think the Republicans are subverted by the fact that so many of their leaders send their kids to private schools, they don't really have the stomach for the fight.","I suppose the White House thinks it's doing what Big Business wants, but it will lead to vastly increased taxes, because all these guest workers are to be allowed to bring their children.","I've been a financial journalist for 30 years.","A nation is an organic thing.","Immigration enthusiasts are so hysterical.","I think Bush's immigration proposal is treason and he should be impeached.","I think the Iraq War is not particularly tailored to American interests.","I think Bush has capitulated on affirmative action and government spending. Apart from that, he's OK, I guess. About the same as Howard Dean.","The real boneheads are the libertarians."],"Peter Brook":["An icon painter starts not with Jesus Christ but by finding earth and rubbing. Now what is earth, what are you rubbing in directing?","I've always worked a bit like a cook in a big restaurant, where you've got lots and lots of things laid out and you go and look into one cauldron and you look into the other and you see what's coming to the boil."],"Peter Buck":["Almost all the fans I meet are pretty cool people. They're intelligent and tend to think about things a bit more than your average rock'n'roll fans: sensible people I wouldn't mind having a drink with.","I've been to nudist beaches, like twice. But honestly, I just don't want to see these people naked. Most people look better with their clothes on, and the few that don't, look better than you, so why bother?","We're the acceptable edge of the unacceptable stuff."],"Peter C. Doherty":["Many key concepts concerning the nature of immunity have originated from the very practical need to control virus infections.","This year, 1996, has been designated the 'Year of the Vaccine,' commemorating the 200th anniversary of Edward Jenner's vaccination of James Phipps with cowpox virus and subsequent challenge with smallpox virus. Insight into the nature of viruses, and how viruses interact with mammalian cells, has evolved since the turn of the century.","My characteristics as a scientist stem from a non-conformist upbringing, a sense of being something of an outsider, and looking for different perceptions in everything from novels, to art to experimental results. I like complexity and am delighted by the unexpected. Ideas interest me.","I share Alfred Nobel's conviction that war is the greatest of all human disasters. Infectious disease runs a good second.","There are too few people working in the area of viral pathogenesis and immunity, too little funding, too many problems, and too little time.","The need to deal with pathogens has driven the evolution of the vertebrate immune system, so it should not be surprising that experiments with infectious agents have often illuminated key elements of the underlying mechanisms.","The thing I love about science is finding out something new and different.","The two things that I miss most when living out of Australia are the bush and the Pacific coast, especially fishing in the surf at night!","My mother was a very talented pianist, and she was a music teacher who hated to teach music, actually, but she loved to play, so I was brought up with Chopin, Debussy and Mozart."],"Peter Camejo":["The Greens have every right to run, that's what democracy is, and they should argue their point by saying how they think people should vote, not by telling us to be silent.","The United States is not for democracy in Iraq, it's for setting up a puppet government.","Deep down, the Iraqi people want the United States out. And their self-determination should be respected.","I was the candidate first time a Green or any progressive third party has ever been in a national televised debate. I was in five of them. And the response from the public was overwhelming.","All electoral laws in Europe are more democratic than they are in the United States.","We must have a fair tax in the United States. We have to re-adjust it, we must be fiscally responsible.","A Green Party candidate would be very different from a Democrat or Republican and should be heard.","The Green Party represents that majority point of view within the U.S.","Much of what we see in America, what most people feel has been progress and good things, have been brought about by the existence of third parties.","I really think the Patriot Act violates our Constitution. It was, it is, an illegal act. The Congress, the Senate and the president cannot change the Constitution.","No one in their right mind can say to me with a straight face that the Patriot Act has not aggregated the Fourth Amendment."],"Peter Capaldi":["Drawing is the only thing I've found in which I can lose myself completely. I love it. It started as something that relaxed me, but now it's a struggle because I'm pushing myself. The day-to-day sketching is fraught.","I'm sure if Shakespeare were alive today, he'd be doing classic guitar solos on YouTube.","I'm not an extravagant man. The fact that I can have a coffee out whenever I want still makes me feel grateful.","Shouting at people keeps you alive, healthy, young, fresh.","I think the periods of being unsuccessful have made me a better actor.","I've been really terrible in a lot of things because I learned by making mistakes. That makes you a different kind of actor, because you have to figure out for yourself what you do.","I love people where, at the end of the day, they'll pick up a paintbrush and paint clouds. They can physically make things.","I'm so lucky to have worked with Burt Lancaster, who I remember was one of the first people I'd heard swearing in a really interesting way.","There is no such thing as too much swearing. Swearing is just a piece of linguistic mechanics. The words in-between are the clever ones.","The higher your profile, the more people want you.","When I first came to London, I loved hanging around in cafes, smoking, scribbling, dreaming. It was life-affirming and fun.","I'm not terribly well read. My wife forces books into my hands and insists I read them, which I'm grateful to her for. She made me read 'War and Peace.' The whole thing. It was amazing, but I had to hide it. You can't walk round reading 'War and Peace' - it's like you're in a comedy sketch and you think you're smart.","The biggest thing I have realized was that you have to choose your collaborators very carefully, and that not everybody can like you. The process of filmmaking is so difficult, there's no point in doing it unless you can do it the way you want.","It was great being brought up in a Glasgow working-class tenement. It wasn't miserable, and it wasn't poverty stricken. It felt very safe, full of delights.","Real heroes are all around us and uncelebrated.","A girl once came to my beery flat in Kensal Green, opened the blinds and cooked me breakfast. I married her.","I don't remember 'Doctor Who' not being part of my life, and it became a part of growing up, along with The Beatles, National Health spectacles, and fog. And it runs deep. It's in my DNA.","If I had gone to drama school, I wouldn't be sitting here now because it would have blanded me out; it would have just turned me into another actor.","I always thought it was funny that my grandparents had bought a ticket to New York and ended up in Glasgow.","A little showbiz never hurt anyone.","The Americans just have a great sort of wit about them.","Hollywood producers aren't going to say, 'Get me that swearing, grey-haired, headless chicken. We need him for our new 'High School Musical' movie!'","Every viewer who ever turned on 'Doctor Who' has taken him into his heart. He belongs to all of us.","My Italian granny and my mother made great spaghetti, but it wasn't a kind of southern Italian, Godfather-esque kind of thing - it was a wonderful, big mixing pot of all kinds of people - when you came home from school and your mum wasn't in, there were lots of people you could go to.","I hated improvisation because in my early days as an actor, improvisation meant somebody had just come down from Oxford and they were doing a play above a pub in Kentish Town, and the biggest ego would win.","My childhood growing up in that part of Glasgow always sounds like some kind of sub-Catherine Cookson novel of earthy working-class immigrant life, which to some extent it was, but it wasn't really as colourful that.","At 17 years old, STG took me under its wing and shared its resources and wisdom with me, even allowing me to take part in a show at the Edinburgh Festival. Without STG and the Ramshorn Theatre, I would not have found access to the world of drama that I later made my profession.","I suppose I just like being arty. That's all. Arty.","I've always been interested in the idea of people who fell through the cracks.","A year after winning the Oscar, almost to the day, I was directing a dog food commercial.","I absolutely hate mowing the lawn. When I hear the mowers starting, I want to kill myself: it's the sound of death approaching. Hoovering's OK, but I never in my life wanted to have a lawn and certainly never wanted to mow one.","The only time I've tried to make plans, the cosmic sledgehammer has intervened and something else has happened. You just have to wait and see what comes your way, so that's what I do.","I don't like parties. There was never a party I was at where I didn't wish I was somewhere else.","I can't imagine I'll be the new George Clooney. That's not really in the cards.","'Doctor Who' belongs to all of us. Everybody makes 'Doctor Who.'","I never really think of acting and directing as being separate; they are just different expressions of the same thing.","I destroyed all my geek stuff because I didn't want to be a geek, and I regret it to this day. Consumed in the geek bonfire of the vanities was a collection of autographs and letters from Peter Cushing, Spike Milligan and Frankie Howerd, the first Doctor Whos, actual astronauts, and many more.","I don't mind being stereotyped as angry - it's good to have a job.","When I was a kid, I wrote to the BBC, and the producers sent me a huge package through the post with 'Doctor Who' scripts. I'd never even seen a script and couldn't believe that they actually wrote this stuff down. It sort of opened a door.","Before 'Local Hero,' I'd been knocking about Glasgow in rock bands, drinking too much and generally being 21. My opinion of actors was that they were straight and boring, so you see, I was completely unprepared for being one.","The only person that I want to love me is my wife.","If people enjoy my profile from the privacy of their own home, that's entirely up to you.","In Peter Ackroyd's book 'London: The Biography,' he describes the route of the medieval wall that enclosed the original city. Take the book and follow it from the Tower of London via the Barbican to Ludgate Hill. You experience the real history of London.","It's one thing getting the job of Doctor Who, which is wonderful. And then the next thing they say to you is, 'We're going to announce it live on television!' And you think, 'That's not exactly what I thought I was signing up for!'","There are only a handful of really good TV programmes, and I'm blessed to be in one of them.","The nurses' job is emotional and distressing. Their day-to-day work is dealing with people withering and falling to pieces. So black humour is essential for them cope with that. It's just a consequence of their environment.","Everybody loves monsters.","Once you reach a certain age, you find yourself visiting hospitals a lot.","I don't think I would have been great in the 17th century. I would have enjoyed the frocks, and certainly some of the food would have been appealing, but the disease and hygiene would have worried me.","What I've learnt being an actor is that you've got to be lucky. I got less lucky, and nobody was interested. If a part came up, it would be for the main corpse's friend's brother who was having problems with his marriage.","Being asked to play 'The Doctor' is an amazing privilege. Like the Doctor himself I find myself in a state of utter terror and delight. I can't wait to get started.","Scottish men of a certain age have a black response to almost everything as a measure of how sophisticated they are. I have a very long fuse that eventually explodes after building up a nice head of steam, although it's only happened three times - usually at work when someone takes me for granted.","I haven't played Doctor Who since I was 9 on the playground.","Even though I am a lifelong 'Doctor Who' fan, I've not played him since I was nine. I downloaded old scripts and practised those in front of the mirror.","STG and the Ramshorn Theatre are a vital part of Glasgow's rich cultural history. To abandon them now is to abandon not only our past, but our future.","One of the very, very exciting things I have found here in L.A. is that no one talks to you about being Scottish. Whereas, if you are in London and you are trying to put films together and be a film-maker, there is a kind of unspoken sense that, if you are Scottish, you have something to overcome or else you cannot really do that project.","It's weathered many a storm, but the British film industry is, thankfully, still afloat.","When I was acting, I was always asking abut the mechanics of filmmaking. I decided I would learn what everyone on set was doing, so I would feel less threatened.","What annoys me about it is that your fate is always in somebody else's hands. It's always up to somebody else to decide whether or not they want you in their show and so the majority of actors have to play out a waiting game. The constant fear is that it could all end tomorrow.","I don't want to find myself at the age of 60 waiting by the telephone for someone else to decide if I am capable of being in what might be a crummy TV production.","The difference between movies and TV is that in TV you have to have a trauma every week, but that event may not be the biggest event in the characters' lives.","What you're doing is acting with yourself. Well, I'm my favourite actor, so in a way it's quite straightforward for me.","I'm pretty good for an old geek.","I was always admiring people who seemed to conduct themselves with ease in the world. Maybe that's a great gift to give your kids if you can do that. Because they can move through the world without neurosis, this anxiety about everything, which our own parents gave us.","Crime is interesting. It's huge and fascinating, and it's what my business, TV and film, is largely based on. But the realities are tragic, and in crime drama you rarely see the pain of bereavement or any consequences. It's reduced to a chess game.","I went to art school in the days when it was what you did if you didn't want to be like everybody else. You wanted to be strange and different, and art school encouraged that. We hated the drama students - they were guys with pipes and cardigans.","The best advice is to get on with it. I'm very prone to falling into depressions - not clinical, just 'can't be bothered.' It's such a waste of time.","Recently, I dreamed that I returned home to find my wife had married Ray Winstone. They were kind and let me stay, but the whole thing was awkward.","I can't imagine I'll be the new George Clooney. That's not really on the cards.","I hate restaurants that play music. You come out for a quiet meal, and you're supposed to put up with all this booming. Why? It's madness!","'Strictly Sinatra' became a compromise between me and the producers, and neither of us liked the results much.","I don't want to make a film to make a film.","My adolescence was a kind of motorway pile-up. I wish I had known that one day the geek would inherit the Earth.","Believe it or not, one teacher used to call me a giant spastic for not being able to play football.","The big reason that 'Doctor Who' is still with us is that every single viewer who ever turned in to watch this show, at any age, at any time in its history, took it into their heart - because 'Doctor Who' belongs to all of us. Everyone made 'Doctor Who.'","I didn't want to be Doctor Who in a 'Doctor Who' that I didn't like.","If you travel in time and space, most of the people you know and love will eventually be gone. But you'll also be able to go and find them again.","I haven't found anything to complain about. But being Scottish, it won't be long.","I don't have any expectations of anything.","I could never plan to have a career that went this well... you know, there were times when it didn't: when it went into the toilet, or ducked, or was difficult to get moving.","Of course I've had my moments of wanting to go back to Scotland, and I almost did a couple of times, but other things just came up.","If I was to meet my eight-year-old self, I would say, 'Don't listen to what they say about you. Wear your anorak with pride!'","The truth is that I got to Hollywood, and I didn't know what to do once I got there.","It seems to me that most things that are being made are designed for young people. There aren't that many depictions of melancholic older people, even though they form a growing proportion of the population.","I could make the title of my memoirs: 'It's got cinematic disaster written all over it.'","I've lost count of the times I've been asked to 'be' Malcolm Tucker: to go on a political program on television, presumably in order to be the character and give opinions as him.","I'm not saying that all politicians are awful. I don't know any of them well enough to say whether they're awful or not. But almost every day, you find out something about them that's appalling. Maybe we shouldn't be surprised any longer.","You can't blame anyone for being cynical about politicians.","Personally, I have as little to do with politicians as possible. The ones that I've met I've found very boring. They're extremely egotistical, incredibly self-important. If I can help it, I try to stay as far away from them as possible.","Nothing compares to being in a room full of politicians screaming abuse at each other all night. It's hilarious but also a bit terrifying.","I wake up in the morning, and I go, 'I'm Doctor Who! I'm playing Doctor Who. I'm Doctor Who.'","I think the nice thing about 'Doctor Who' is whether people like it or don't like it, somewhere, someone loves you and will always love you - and the more everyone hates you, the more they'll love you.","What's now shocking is I can't say anything publicly without it having a life. Not because I have extraordinary views but because people are keen on conflict, so they'll make that the story.","My family know not to get me any tech for Christmas. I can never get it to work, and it all becomes very tearful and pressurised.","If you put me in a real Tardis, I dread to think what would happen to the universe.","Comic-Con is so legendary, so a great thrill to be invited along.","Everywhere I go, I am The Doctor, and everyone smiles at me - they are pleased to see Doctor Who, who's far more exciting than I am.","I turn down invitations to events where I know there will be politicians.","I find the closer you get to people, the harder it is to satirise them.","I think it's not misplaced in 'Doctor Who' to have someone who is little bit edgy and maybe a little volatile and dangerous.","I think it's always exciting when 'Doctor Who' touches its past.","Even if I hadn't been cast as Doctor Who, my acting would probably have been influenced by William Hartnell or Patrick Troughton, Jon Pertwee, Tom Baker, and all of the other guys. Because those were the actors that I really watched every moment of, as opposed to Laurence Olivier.","You can't, as an actor, conduct yourself by making constant references to other people.","The thing that runs through the British film industry even today is a lot of unsung movies are financially the bigger ones. Even though they weren't always the greatest of movies, something in them was very potent which people loved.","I know what 'Doctor Who' fans are like because I am a 'Doctor Who' fan myself. They're good people.","I'm fascinated by fire. When I was four, I wore an American fireman's hat all the time, and I still have one in my office today. Glasgow used to be called 'Tinderbox City;' there were always fires, people getting killed.","We don't consider the Wizard of Oz or Father Christmas to be too old. They're still magical characters, and the fact they've been around the block only adds to their magic.","I think the whole spoiler thing has taken over the media.","For all I know, my grandfather was a bank robber in Kilsyth.","My parents didn't take me to the theatre to see Chekhov when I was growing up - we went to see 'Francie and Josie' once every five years.","I'm creative. I can't relax unless I've got some project on the go. I'm somebody from art school, and art school during the punk era, when you just had a go at whatever came along.","I just consciously try to enjoy the good things that are happening. And if it ended tomorrow, that would be fine.","I love Hugh Laurie, but I don't want to be a guy who goes to work every day for nine months of the year in a corner of Burbank. I really don't. I like doing a bit here and a bit there and strange things, and I think that's held me back.","Nowadays, kids... young actors... they go straight to L.A. before they've even done anything.","Maybe it's because I've been an actor for such a long time, but I think, unless you're a big star, you don't really have much control over anything. I've never been able to make any plans.","I don't go to pubs.","I hate the Internet. It's full of rubbish. I'm on it all the time, watching terrible, useless things and ossifying my brain.","I spent four months once doing a play on Broadway.","Why can't jazz musicians just leave a melody alone?","I was initially rather charmed by David Cameron, but I think he's revealing himself to be a slightly darker and less charismatic figure than he first appeared. There's a brutality about him.","The biggest problem of all is that it's very difficult to tell my daughter, 'Swearing is not clever or funny,' because I earn a living by swearing.","I think the truth is always interesting, but with politicians, you don't get to see much of that.","I have a fairly normal domestic life.","I got into music, I was in a band, I was at art school. I was quite trendy, although I'd hate to meet myself. The over-preening, the pretentiousness, the arrogance of youth! I think, 'Oh, that guy was so full of himself.'","'Doctor Who' has a certain amount of showbiz attached to it.","One of the problems with episodic television of any color is that everything has got to be okay at the end of the episode so it can start again next week.","I'm just physically stupid.","'Atlantic City' is very good.","I love these sort of documentaries, which you might turn on late on a Saturday night - like, say, 'The Alma Cogan Story.' But they are ripe for spoofing, because the presenters are always so serious and anxious to make themselves look like rather attractive and interesting people.","I lived through a golden period where society felt that it was good to help people who didn't have a great deal of money fulfil their potential.","I wouldn't be here if it were not for the grant system that paid for me to go to art school - because my parents couldn't have afforded it.","I failed the audition to get into drama school.","Generally I draw every day just to keep my hand in. I draw while I'm sitting on the Tube or in restaurants. Just doodling things and people I see.","I think all actors experience ups and downs.","I've had very bleak experiences in hospitals, but they were also sometimes very funny.","When I was at school, you couldn't draw and be into football, too. If you were into art, then you were seen as an absolute pansy, and there was no way you'd be admitted to the guys' world of football.","One year was so bad for me and my wife that we were going to have to sell our house until Elaine decided to change career and earn some money.","I've only lost my temper three times in my whole life.","The British film industry has always tried to sell itself as something rather sophisticated. It's almost as if it thinks it is by royal command. It has always tried to claim the high ground, not only over Hollywood but over the whole of humanity!","I like the constant rise and fall of the British film industry. But above all, I like the workhorses who kept going no matter what.","The Hollywood image of the movie business is all about ambition and high achievers like James Cameron. But the British film industry is much more about men who wear cravats and work with model trains and hope another series of 'Thomas the Tank Engine' will be commissioned."],"Peter Carey":["Good writing of course requires talent, and no one can teach you to have talent.","At the very end of a book I can manage to work for longer stretches, but mostly, making stuff up for three hours, that's enough. I can't do any more. At the end of the day I might tinker with my morning's work and maybe write some again. But I think three hours is fine.","Being famous as a writer is like being famous in a village. It's not really any very heady fame.","I don't separate my books into historical novels and the rest. To me, they're all made-up worlds, and both kinds are borne out of curiosity, some investigation into the past.","My greatest pleasure is to invent. My continual mad ambition is to make something true and beautiful that never existed in the world before.","I like how they are. I think they're great. And their communities are communities. I have a greater sense of community in New York than almost anywhere I've ever lived. Really, it's terrific.","I thought I would be an organic chemist. I went off to university, and when I couldn't understand the chemistry lectures I decided that I would be a zoologist, because zoologists seemed like life-loving people.","The great thing about using the past is that it gives you the most colossal freedom to invent. The research is necessary, of course, but no one writes a novel to dramatically illustrate what everybody already knows.","I have written a memoir here and there, and that takes its own form of selfishness and courage. However, generally speaking, I have no interest in writing about my own life or intruding in the privacy of those around me.","What I find really attractive is something that's going to be a little dangerous. Something that might get me into trouble; you know, you turn up in London and you've just rewritten Dickens. And, of course, then you think, 'What have I done?'","I don't think you have the right to shout about other people's private life.","Nostalgia is something we think of as fuzzy. But it's pain. Pain concerning the past.","I'm always the one with the activist friends. I've been an activist very little.","I think that thing about the destruction of the world is there all the time, it's there every day when we look out the window.","It's true: one of the things that I've always thought about American society is that you never get the sort of natural politicisation of class consciousness that you would get in the United Kingdom or even in Australia.","And it's always possible that you will not get a nice review. So - and that's enraging of course, to get a bad review, you can't talk back, and it's sort of shaming in a way.","I went to work in 1962, and by '64 I was writing all the time, every night and every weekend. It didn't occur to me that, having read nothing and knowing nothing, I was in no position to write a book.","So in the first draft, I'm inventing people and place with a broad schematic idea of what's going to happen. In the process, of course, I discover all sorts of bigger and more substantial things.","I never base characters on real people. There are people who do that but I really don't know how to do it.","One has to be able to twist and change and distort characters, play with them like clay, so everything fits together. Real people don't permit you to do that.","Writers, at least writers of fiction, are always full of anxiety and worry.","I'm interested in where we are, where we're going, where we've come from.","Australia is my lens. I cannot see the world any other way.","I woke up in Australia almost every day for the first 47 years of my life. When I left, I didn't discard that, didn't reject that, didn't forget that. Not even New York City can wipe that out.","The Australian cast of mind is not something I would want to be without - and I couldn't be without. It's not a choice.","When I was young and easily outraged, I would be upset when every fictional character I created was somehow reduced to 'autobiography.'","Culture is the way for a country to know itself.","I think there was, and there is, a real Commonwealth culture. It's different. America doesn't really feel to be a part of that.","The failure of the U.S.'s foreign adventures often seems to have its roots in the U.S.'s total ignorance of things on the ground, of the countries that they fiddle with.","I would be the worst person on earth to be called to write an account of someone else's life.","I'm someone who always wants to do everything differently. If I have a pattern, I'd rather I didn't have a pattern. I want every book to be unpredictable and new. Damn it!","My father left school at the age of fourteen, so this was a man with no deep experience of formal education.","My mother was the daughter of a poor schoolteacher - well, that's a tautology - a country schoolteacher.","When I finally began to publish, my father never read my work. He'd say, 'Oh, that's your mother's sort of thing.' But my mother found the books rather upsetting. I figure she read just enough to know that she didn't want to go there.","I got a job in advertising. So even though I was writing, I was always supporting myself. That's the thing that would matter for my father, who was absolutely a creature of the Great Depression.","At school, I was fanatical about being a scientist.","Faulkner's 'As I Lay Dying' had an immense effect on me, and most of my novels bear the burn marks of this experience, those short chapters with their conflicting points of view, truth expressed by multiple perspectives. The other attractive thing about 'As I Lay Dying' was the way it gave rich voices to the poor.","When I finished 'True History of the Kelly Gang,' I realised that Faulkner had not lost his power over me.","I have no interest in writing, generally speaking, about America at all - even if it does continue to terrify me.","When I went to live in New York, I didn't mean to stay there, but here I am.","I used to say when I was younger, 'I'm exhausted; writers can only write for four hours a day and that's done.' Now I find, as I'm getting older and I'm more aware of time, I can actually write all day.","It's not like I've got 100 ideas. I finish a book, and I've got none.","I was very anxious when I was writing 'Oscar And Lucinda.' I would take other books off the shelf to check my chapter length was OK.","There are people that you don't like because you're jealous of them until you meet them. And you haven't read their book because it's had so much attention. Then you meet them and discover they've been jealous of you, and you become friends.","I have never begun a novel which wasn't going to stretch me further than I had ever stretched before.","In about 1975-76, I lived with a woman in a little hut with some fruit trees, and I had some of the most extraordinary, happy times of my life. Apart from the horrendous Queensland police, who were corrupt and venal, it really was like living in paradise.","I always pity people who have to write my plot synopses."],"Peter Cetera":["The rut I was in with the people that I had been previously been with it took the heart right out of me."],"Peter Chernin":["It's a tough marketplace right now... It is very compressed... A turnaround is likely to happen quicker than before.","For the very first time, viewers will be able to watch their favorite shows before the rest of the world.","The mobile market is exploding and it makes perfect sense for a media company like ours to create a real content destination for the billions of cell-phone users around the world.","The formation of the News America Publishing Group will lead to greater editorial excitement, new business opportunities and greater efficiencies and coordination.","We need to be a leadership position about protecting minors on the Internet and, more importantly, giving the parents the tools they need to protect them."],"Peter Conrad":["Losing faith in your own singularity is the start of wisdom, I suppose; also the first announcement of death.","All that a city will ever allow you is an angle on it, an oblique, indirect sample of what it contains, or what passes through it; a point of view.","The historian's job is to aggrandize, promoting accident to inevitability and innocuous circumstance to portent."],"Peter Cook":["I would much prefer to be a judge than a coal miner because of the absence of falling coal.","I am very interested in the Universe - I am specialising in the Universe and all that surrounds it."],"Peter Cooper":["A true history of human events would show that a far larger proportion of our acts are the result of sudden impulse and accident than of that reason of which we so much boast.","I have always recognized that the object of business is to make money in an honorable manner. I have endeavored to remember that the object of life is to do good."],"Peter Coyote":["The body is an inviolable limit. And you have to really hurt it before you know that.","I got out of college and I went to get my master's in creative writing at San Francisco State. I was working as an actor at the Actor's Workshop, being abused as a intern.","I think you have a social responsibility as the villain, which is pretty different from the hero's responsibility. If you have any kind of a social or political conscience at all, the first thing you want to do is make malevolence recognizable to people, almost as a kind of teaching aid.","Habitat for wildlife is continually shrinking - I can at least provide a way station.","Money is a way of creating scarcity.","My dad was a very violent, frightening and dangerous guy. Next to him, I was this vague kind of kid who walked around, as I still do, gathering impressions.","When I got to Grinnell College, I was part of the black turtleneck sweater and Camel cigarette crowd of poets and writers.","Interdependence is a fact, it's not an opinion.","I would say 90 percent of my mail and phone calls are from people who want some kind of help or succor or commitment from me to do something.","It came home to me indelibly that I was never going to change anything in America by walking around carrying a sign. It was a great revelation. It saved me a lot of anxiety and a lot of wasted energy.","Any political agenda and organization which doesn't begin with personal responsibility is just half the argument. It's just not going to succeed.","Business is a subset of the environment, not the other way around. You can't have a healthy economy, you can't have a healthy anything in a degraded environment.","My gift seems to be that I am able to tell a story in a comprehensible and engaging way.","People call me a movie star. If you're in the business, a movie star is someone who can make a film bankable. My name and $6 million will make a $6 million movie. I'm a working actor. Because I started late, I had a very short run as a leading man, and my films didn't make money in America.","I believe that when you're wrong, own it and apologize, and so I do and put it on the equivalent of my front page.","In 2001, Texaco was bought by Chevron, and during deliberations concerning that sale, an 800 page document listing the problems and liabilities connected to Texaco was brought forward at their stockholder meeting by Amazon Watch, a non-profit dedicated to protecting the Amazon.","When I was young and growing up in New York, my parents took me to children's theater quite often - elaborate presentations of 'Goldilocks' and 'Rapunzel' for Upper East Side kids. As I grew older, they took me to adult theater, mostly musicals.","You don't see artists sitting around a lot, talking about ideology. They find out what they believe, and what they're doing, by doing it.","I think it's good that people value their bodies and take care of them. I think if you cross the line and begin using your body as an asset or as an extension of your vanity, you've gone too far.","I've always been a writer.","When you break the rules and you win, you're a hero; when you lose, you're scurrilous.","There has to be that feeling in a good villain - that he's awesome, he has his own power; that he is, in several senses, unstoppable.","Kennedy invited us into the White House-the first time in the history of the White House picketers had been invited inside. This made front page headlines.","I think the '60s were an extraordinary time. I feel bad for the kids today who missed this wonderful confluence, which was simultaneously a confluence of the global and the mythological.","The self is just not a worthy enough vehicle to worship.","Everyone knows that our current system is kind of like legalized prostitution. The corporate sector completely controls the civic sector.","The first time I read something, I have this special feeling of being fully engaged with it. It's fresh to the audience because it's fresh to me. It's a little mystical, but I really believe that.","My house and my garden are built as part of nature, not over it.","Acting is the way I make my living.","The terrible thing about being an actor is that it's not a solo occupation.","Writing is something I can do by myself.","In 1972, Texaco Oil Company, in partnership with PetroEcuador, the state-run oil company of Ecuador, began to drill for oil in the jungles of the Ecuadorian Amazon.","I am fascinated by women. They're as close as we men get to experiencing 'the other.' The challenge for me was to know and accept fully formed, powerful women.","Young people, for whom I should have been a role model and an uncle, duplicated my worst habits and died as a result.","Where I didn't have the maturity and the compassion to consider other people's needs, I did a lot of damage.","One of the most treasured books that I own is Donald Allen's 'The New American Poetry, 1945-1960.' It was a totem of great importance and potency to my group of writer friends in college from 1960 to 1964.","When I went to get my master's in creative writing at San Francisco State after Grinnell, I joined the moribund remnants of the Actor's Workshop, until I saw Kay Hayward and Sandy Archer in the San Francisco Mime Troupe and drove down that day to audition. The rest is history.","We spend all this energy keeping our lives normal and safe and predictable, and the result is that our approved cultural safety valve is the movies. So in films, anyway, the hero is obliged to represent the continuance of social values and institutions, and his permission to act is much more seriously limited than the villain's.","We put on shows at Golden Gate Park with the Dead and Jefferson Airplane, and the groups were part of the community they emerged out of, not some superstars. We had multiple stages, diversions, communal entertainment. There is something slightly fascistic about sitting in a huge auditorium focusing all the energy on one group far away on stage."],"Peter Criss":["Musicians play music because you love... I loved to play drums since I was five. It's all I ever wanted to do. Rock stars, or as we call them, posers, guys who want to just look great, dress great. They're not musicians; they're looking for the fame.","We're playing the Superbowl this year, we're opening up before the coins drop.","I deal with guys in their 20s and early 30s who are presidents of companies, who are movie directors.","There's not a day that goes by that I don't bless myself with holy water and then get in my car and rub the medal of the Virgin Mary that she gave me and say a Hail Mary for my mother. And then I kiss her Mass card that's right there on the dashboard.","I find myself evil. I believe in the devil as much as God. You can use either one to get things done.","We're really in control; that's the difference. We were out of control then.","We're much more controlled now. We were kids back then, we each had our own demons. It was insanity.","The magic's back and we're in a time tunnel, feeling like when we were in our 20s back in the 1970s.","There's a lot of smoke being blown at you, but this is no new sport to me; I've been doing it a long time, I'm used to it and I see it coming immediately the minute it gets into our realm.","As busy as I claim to be, I've still got the greatest job in the world.","I once had money to burn. I'd fly to Barbados for the weekend. I lived in a twenty-two-room mansion and had my pick of four luxury cars.","What I love about being a member of KISS is that we're the 'John Glenns' of rock - we always have to be the first in anything we do, and I love that.","I'm from Brooklyn. I grew up very poor- seven people, four rooms. My dad had no education.","It's a younger generation running the show, and I miss the generation we had in the '70s. They were really very honorable guys, like Neal Bogart and Bill Graham, people who will never be around again.","Cool things happen. Ace's guitar flies through space, goes through a hole, and blows up. I throw drumsticks and they come flying at you.","Three times during the show the drums are lifted over the audience - I go up and out, right, left and back.","I finally got a chance to talk to my daughter from my previous marriage. I just got married May 3 to my beautiful wife, but we don't see each other much.","I think money, power, fame changes people a lot.","For me, music is all about emotion and attitude.","When 'Destroyer' was first released, we got a strong backlash from our hardcore fans. After six months, the album was dead in the water. The critics didn't think much of it, either."],"Peter Cullen":["I'm always involved with the Aerospace Program and NASA and Goddard Space Flight Center. And if kids feel so inclined, they can log onto NASA and the Optimus Prime Spinoff Award, which we present every year to some of the brilliant young minds that are taking up into the academics of space, science, technology, math.","As a young actor, I would be invited to the CBC radio drama department to do voices for different characters, and I found that I could do quite a few of them. I wasn't a visual presence, and I found it easier to construct a voice from the written page.","I immerse myself right into my character whether or not I'm relating to people live as an actor on stage or whatever.","I enjoy dramatic narration, of course, because I'm an actor and I started as an actor. But I love things that are a challenge, and I look forward to more work with that in the future. So there's always a sun coming up the following day for me.","Everybody's going to approach a character differently, depending upon what they bring to it on their own intellectual level or their feelings from their heart and soul.","My brother was a captain in the Marine Corps and a very big hero in my life.","I always try to make a voice to go with the characteristics - if the guy's a hothead or he's cool, whatever.","The phenomenon of 'Transformers' itself is mind-shaking, you know?","I kind of modeled Optimus Prime's voice out of many people I had known over the years, my family especially."],"Peter Cushing":["I didn't set out to make this kind of picture. It just came my way. But its been going on for me for 16 years now and its wonderful for an actor to work consistently. There seems to be an insatiable audience for this type of film.","I don't think there is really a favorite, I'm very fond of film making as a whole and as a medium and of course, there are some that I've enjoyed making more than others but I've enjoyed making all of them.","You see I don't like to be really too commercial about things but in this business you've just got to be commercial otherwise the films don't make money and you don't make films and as a long as a commodity is selling it's silly to kill it dead.","Today's youth cannot miss something they have never known, but I fear that there are no current fictional characters whose impact and influence will last with such abiding affection into their 'sore and yellow' as this splendid man's creations have in mine!","There are all sorts of reasons why I don't do much work in the theatre, the main one being that after two performances I feel I've given all I can. I hate repetition, I really do. It's like asking a painter to paint he same picture every day of his life.","I hope this doesn't sound pompous but I don't think of myself as famous, whatever fame I've got has come through what I've done and associations of things I've done.","I'm always glad to be offered roles, but wouldn't take any role as this could do you more harm than good, but I've been at what they call 'on the top' as far as being known for twenty years."],"Peter D. Mitchell":["The final outcome cannot be known, either to the originator of a new theory, or to his colleagues and critics, who are bent on falsifying it. Thus, the scientific innovator may feel all the more lonely and uncertain.","Meanwhile, the originator of a theory may have a very lonely time, especially if his colleagues find his views of nature unfamiliar, and difficult to appreciate.","Moreover, in the experimental sciences, the scientific fraternity must test a new theory to destruction, if possible.","Reason can be used only when looking critically back."],"Peter Davison":["And there are a lot more people reading poetry, but there are not so many people reading an individual poet.","It is very difficult for people to come in contact with their own emotions and their own sensibilities.","The trouble with the performance poets is that they don't seem to have read anything. So there is not a real sense of the poetic tradition in their work.","I think poetry has lost an awful lot of its muscle because nobody knows any. Nobody has to memorize poetry.","Poetry was invented as an mnemonic device to enable people to remember their prayers.","Every so often I find some poems that are too good for the readers of The Atlantic because they are a little too involved with the nature of poetry, as such.","It is a way we reassess our past. We can do that in poetry in ways we can't do in prose.","I just think that some version of the past in our culture is going to rise up and become dominant.","Frost is the most sophisticated of poets.","The more poetry you have in the head, the more poetry you will understand because you will be getting to the roots of what it is that makes people write poetry at all.","But poetry is my life. Poetry is what matters to me.","I would like to be proud of having written some poems that will be remembered, but I will never know whether I will have any reason to be proud of that.","People are talking about the Internet as though it is going to change the world. It's not going to change the world. It's not going to change the way we think, and it's not going to change the way we feel.","The problem, for me, with the writing programs is that they produce a terrible uniformity of product.","My friends never talk to me about my poetry because they're embarrassed that I write it or they're embarrassed by what I write about which are not such extraordinarily terrifying things, but they are the state of human existence.","Dealing with poetry is a daunting task, simply because the reason one does it as an editor at all is because one is constantly coming to terms with one's own understanding of how to understand the world.","Poetry should be able to reach everybody, and it should be able to appeal to all levels of understanding.","In my youth, I found that I was quite often inspired and pushed forward by what I read.","They need to learn poetry. They don't need to learn about poetry. They don't need to be told how to interpret poetry. They don't need to be told how to understand poetry. They need to learn it.","In order to understand what they need to understand, in order to write what they write, they have to be free. And yet, they aren't ever free. They are not free because they are not free of the constrictions their art puts on them.","For instance, it's a little better now than it was two or three years ago, but something like 70% of the poems I receive seem to be written in the present indicative.","Poetry is composing for the breath.","I like poems that are little games.","I like poems that are complex.","If poets were realistic, they wouldn't be poets.","The reason one writes poems is so that your poem will be remembered.","The relation between a poet and audience is really insignificant. What matters is the poet is hearing something that he is broadcasting. And whether there is anybody with a receiver isn't the reason he does it. He hopes there is somebody receiving it.","But there is some way in which poets believe that and this is dangerous, too believe that their calling gives them a certain freedom. A certain freedom to live in a free way.","But for me, being an editor I've been an editor of all kinds of books being an editor of poetry has been the way in which I could give a crucial part of my time to what I love most.","If I were brave enough to say so, I'd like to think that I had written some poems that people are not going to forget.","There are so many things that poetry is about, one of which is memory."],"Peter Dawson":["Our championship committee pledged to review entry conditions and to assess how women golfers might compete on equal terms with men for a place in the Open.","You wait until the forest fire is on your front step before you step up.","It is no secret that the Golf Foundation has had its difficulties.","The hesitancy is in the detail, not the principal. There has been no resistance to the principal of women playing in the Open if they are qualified for it. We are not dragging our feet. It's just that we never had cause to think about it before."],"Peter De Vries":["The bonds of matrimony are like any other bonds - they mature slowly.","Life is a zoo in a jungle.","The rich aren't like us, they pay less taxes.","Gluttony is an emotional escape, a sign something is eating us.","Pain is the question mark turned like a fishhook in the human heart.","I was thinking that we all learn by experience, but some of us have to go to summer school.","Nostalgia isn't what it used to be.","We are not primarily put on this earth to see through one another, but to see one another through.","The murals in restaurants are on par with the food in museums.","The universe is like a safe to which there is a combination. But the combination is locked up in the safe.","I love being a writer. What I can't stand is the paperwork.","Celibacy is the worst form of self-abuse.","Words fashioned with somewhat over precise diction are like shapes turned out by a cookie cutter.","Everybody hates me because I'm so universally liked.","The tuba is certainly the most intestinal of instruments, the very lower bowel of music.","I wanted to be bored to death, as good a way to go as any.","My father hated radio and could not wait for television to be invented so he could hate that too.","It is the final proof of God's omnipotence that he need not exist in order to save us.","We must love one another, yes, yes, that's all true enough, but nothing says we have to like each other.","Let us hope, that a kind Providence will put a speedy end to the acts of God under which we have been laboring.","The difficulty with marriage is that we fall in love with a personality, but must live with a character.","A suburban mother's role is to deliver children obstetrically once, and by car forever after.","The satirist shoots to kill while the humorist brings his prey back alive and eventually releases him again for another chance.","Murals in restaurants are on a par with the food in museums.","Confession is good for the soul only in the sense that a tweed coat is good for dandruff - it is a palliative rather than a remedy.","The value of marriage is not that adults produce children but that children produce adults.","There are times when parenthood seems nothing more than feeding the hand that bites you.","When I can no longer bear to think of the victims of broken homes, I begin to think of the victims of intact ones.","I write when I'm inspired, and I see to it that I'm inspired at nine o'clock every morning.","Who of us is mature enough for offspring before the offspring themselves arrive? The value of marriage is not that adults produce children but that children produce adults."],"Peter DeFazio":["The U.S. cannot impose freedom, security, and unity in Iraq by force.","The U.S. cannot force Sunnis, Shias, and Kurds to make peace or to act for the common good. They have been in conflict for 1,400 years.","It was Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda who attacked the U.S. on September 11, 2001, not Saddam Hussein and Iraq.","Second, the resolution contains the blatantly false assertion that negotiating a timeline for bringing U.S. troops home with the Iraqi government undermines U.S. national security. Such a statement shows a misunderstanding of the enemy we face in Iraq.","The training and equipping of Iraqi security forces should be accelerated.","Saddam Hussein was a brutal tyrant. I am glad he is now on trial for crimes against humanity. But, opposition to a dictator is not the measure I use when deciding whether to send our men and women in uniform off to war and possible death.","About 75 percent of the crude oil marketed here is sold off the books, and they are doing trades that would be illegal if it was a regulated market, and of course they do not want to regulate it.","To the contrary, I believe the U.S. military has already done all that has been asked of them. Saddam Hussein is on trial. The threat from alleged weapons of mass destruction programs in Iraq has been neutralized.","Even the majority of the Sunnis have grown tired of foreign terrorists operating in Iraq.","Essentially, when we run a deficit, we are borrowing money to buy things that are made overseas.","In recent years, breweries and brew pubs have flourished across the Nation. And, as the Representative from Oregon's fourth district, I have enjoyed seeing the diversity that craft brewery has fueled across the Nation.","In crude oil trading, we have seen a 46 percent increase over 1 year in the margins there.","Of the 55 refineries closed in America in the last 10 years, they were all closed for economic reasons, mostly oil company mergers. Not a single one was closed for environmental purposes or objections.","There is a lot of lip service paid in this Congress and downtown at the White House about family values and small business. Who better represents family values and small business than the fishermen and women on the Oregon and California coast.","Nor should the U.S. military be forced to remain in Iraq essentially as an army for one side of a civil war.","A timeline for bringing U.S. troops home that is negotiated with the Iraqi government would also boost the Iraqi government's legitimacy and claim to self-rule, and force the Iraqi government to take responsibility for itself and its citizens.","Similarly, establishing a firm timeline for bringing our troops home could accelerate the development of Iraqi security forces and deepen their commitment to defending their own country and their own government.","In addition to a timeline, I have proposed that U.S. troops be removed from front line combat positions in Iraqi cities and towns, turning over daily security patrols, interactions with citizens, and any offensive security actions to the Iraqis themselves.","The U.S. must renounce any U.S. interest in constructing permanent U.S. military bases in Iraq.","There is no free market in oil.","But they are not going to take on Big Oil because Big Oil is very generous at campaign time, and this is all about the elections. They want to pretend that they are doing something meaningful.","First off, the crude oil market, unlike every other commodity in America, is virtually unregulated."],"Peter DeLuise":["My knowledge of Vancouver and Canada was limited to what I knew about Bob and Doug McKenzie. I thought they were funny, talking out of the sides of their mouths and saying 'eh' and wearing toques.","If you were shopping for a father, you'd have to take out a serious loan to afford mine. He's the best.","I was shot from the funny gun.","I was the fat kid, so as a defense mechanism, I was the jokester.","Dad loves my stuff. No matter how many times my voice cracks or I miss a tap, he doesn't care. He's like some businessman making it to his kid's recital.","I was not very well-behaved. I remember I was a discipline problem. I was a typical American male at twenty years old, and I was causing trouble whenever I could."],"Peter Diamandis":["Your mindset matters. It affects everything - from the business and investment decisions you make, to the way you raise your children, to your stress levels and overall well-being.","At its core, bitcoin is a smart currency designed by very forward-thinking engineers. It eliminates the need for banks, gets rid of credit card fees, currency exchange fees, money transfer fees, and reduces the need for lawyers in transitions... all good things.","Have an open mind - allow different ideas into your way of thinking.","If someone is always to blame, if every time something goes wrong someone has to be punished, people quickly stop taking risks. Without risks, there can't be breakthroughs.","Nothing is more precious than life... especially the life of your child.","Drones photograph, prospect and advertise real estate from golf courses to skyscrapers; they also monitor construction in progress.","Learning how to understand how technology evolves, using tools like a Technology Road Map, is what you need more than anything to ride on top of the tsunami instead of being crushed by it.","As medical research continues and technology enables new breakthroughs, there will be a day when malaria and most all major deadly diseases are eradicated on Earth.","My personal fascination with the power of the crowd has been growing: Exactly what can a 'crowd' accomplish? We know crowds can raise billions of dollars, create Wikipedia, and even design and build small autonomous drones. But how about something large and complex like designing a new car, and maybe someday even a spaceship?","True disruption means threatening your existing product line and your past investments. Breakthrough products disrupt current lines of businesses.","The world's biggest problems are the world's biggest market opportunities. And that's a huge thing. Solve hunger, literacy and energy problems, get the gratitude of the world and become a billionaire in the process.","Many have built their careers buttressing the status quo, reinforcing what they've already accomplished, and resisting the radical thinking that can topple their legacy - not exactly the attitude you want when trying to drive innovation forward.","Make it clear up front what the aim of the company is. Stay true to your authentic vision.","Regardless of what the naysayers believe about human interaction and social media, the data show us that the abundance of technology is actually increasing the abundance of happiness all over the world.","As lower-cost phones begin to penetrate, they'll become the educator and physician everywhere on the planet.","All over the world, we're seeing access to food, clean water, education and healthcare improve; as a result, global innovation is rising as well.","Super-ambitious goals tend to be unifying and energizing to people; but only if they believe there's a chance of success.","Many people who try to do big bold things in the world find out it's not about the money or the technology: It's about the regulatory hurdles that will try and stop you.","Nothing gets us down more than watching violence on television or reading about war and brutality in the newspaper. The truth is, there's a massive reduction in the amount of violence around the world.","Never tolerate a toxic person in your organization.","Companies have too many experts who block innovation. True innovation really comes from perpendicular thinking.","I think about the Internet and cell phones and jets and spaceships, and I wonder, 'What's going to make that look ancient?'","Mining asteroids will ultimately benefit humanity on and off the Earth in a multitude of ways.","As sensors and networks continue to expand around the world, we'll see violence drop even further. After all, when there's a danger that your actions can be caught on tape and shown around the world, you're more responsible for your behavior.","Drones watch for disease and collect real-time data on crop health and yields.","Visual artists use drones to capture beautiful new images and camera angles.","When I think about creating abundance, it's not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet; it's about creating a life of possibility. It is about taking that which was scarce and making it abundant.","Bad news sells because the amygdala is always looking for something to fear.","One thing that humans still do better than computers is recognize images.","An exponential growth is a simple doubling. One becomes two becomes four.","Incentive prizes work.","People need to understand how exponential technologies are impacting the business landscape. They need to do some future-casting and look at how industries are evolving and being transformed.","I think we're heading towards a world of what I call 'technological socialism.' Where technology - not the government or the state - will begin to take care of us. Technology will provide our healthcare for free. The best education in the world - for free.","Nothing matters more than your health. Healthy living is priceless. What millionaire wouldn't pay dearly for an extra 10 or 20 years of healthy aging?","The U.S. government doesn't build your computers, nor do you fly aboard a U.S. government owned and operated airline. Private industry routinely takes technologies pioneered by the government and turns them into cheap, reliable and robust industries. This has happened in aviation, air mail, computers, and the Internet.","The truest drive comes from doing what you love.","Passion gets an entrepreneur through the startup days and the enormous efforts it takes to build a business.","Every second of every day, our senses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains.","If the risk is fully aligned with your purpose and mission, then it's worth considering.","3D printing has digitized the entire manufacturing process.","There are nearly one billion illiterate people on Earth.","After more than a decade as the editor of 'Wired' magazine, Chris Anderson started the company of his dreams - a robotics manufacturing company called 3D Robotics - to produce the autonomous flying vehicles coming out of DIY Drones.","Elon Musk with PayPal revolutionized banking.","The fact is that data are worth a lot of money.","It used to be that, in astronomy, a small team of people could look at photos of a few thousand galaxies and classify and catalog them relatively easily. But now, with a new generation of robotic telescopes scanning the skies constantly and producing millions of images, that's become next to impossible.","We are living toward incredible times where the only constant is change, and the rate of change is increasing.","I founded a launch company called International Microspace when I graduated medical school in 1989. We were trying to build a microsatellite launcher.","Space is an inspirational concept that allows you to dream big.","I get demoralized by organizations that start off with a mission and pull back when they find it's risky.","Three hundred years ago, during the Age of Enlightenment, the coffee house became the center of innovation.","It's now possible to have your body 3D-imaged from head to toe at a sub-millimeter accuracy, showing every ripple of muscle or cellulite, to allow the perfect-fitting jeans or shoes.","3D printing will massively reduce the cost of certain products as the cost of labor is removed.","In 1750, 75 percent of people on the planet worked to support the top 25 percent.","The challenge is that the day before something is truly a breakthrough, it's a crazy idea. And crazy ideas are very risky to attempt.","When I talk about taking bold actions in the world, few things are bolder than creating the 'Huffington Post' from scratch and reinventing the newspaper business.","I live in L.A., where every coffee shop is filled with scriptwriters, producers and directors.","Most advertisers spend millions upon millions of dollars to buy commercial time during the Super Bowl, and millions in creating eye-popping ads, hoping to create catchy, unforgettable commercials. Unfortunately, most Super Bowl commercials end up being unmemorable. Costly mistakes for brands and creative flameouts for advertising firms.","With faster Internet and better computers, you'd better believe we're creating and consuming more digital data.","Today, the smartphone in your pocket has a high-quality digital camera. Everyone - not just artists - is a photographer, and the explosion of photos taken annually proves it.","When I was a grad student at MIT, I had a chance to become friends with the Viking Mission's chief scientist, Dr. Gerald Soffen. Viking was the first Mars lander looking for signs of life on Mars.","The old newspaper adage, 'If it bleeds, it leads,' is as true today as it was a century ago.","If the government regulates against use of drones or stem cells or artificial intelligence, all that means is that the work and the research leave the borders of that country and go someplace else.","In 1976, Kodak's first digital camera shot at 0.1 megapixels, weighed 3.75 pounds, and cost over $10,000.","The goal of my work is to help assure that we can create a world of abundance in which we meet the basic needs of every man, woman and child.","Because it's cheaper and easier to fly than ever before, air travel is becoming democratized.","Even a small village in the middle of Africa with a 3D printer will have access to any good it can download. The world of the 'Star Trek' replicator is not far away.","When you have an employee who's innovative in your organization, what are they thinking about in the shower? If they're working in an exciting place, they're not thinking what they're going to do over the weekend. They're thinking: 'How do I solve that problem?'","Now the amygdala is our early warning detector, our danger detector. It sorts and scours through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might harm us. So given a dozen news stories, we will preferentially look at the negative news.","My childhood dreams were focused on being part of the effort to make humanity a multiplanetary species.","My father, who grew up picking olives on the Greek island of Lesbos, was a doctor. So my family expected me to become a physician.","In 1980, during my sophomore year at MIT, I realized that the school didn't have a student space organization. I made posters for a group I called Students for the Exploration and Development of Space and put them up all over campus. Thirty-five people showed up. It was the first thing I ever organized, and it took off!","I think people are dreaming big because they have the tools to dream big. I hope that people are dreaming big because it makes them feel good about their lives.","I don't think the space station is innovative. Going to the moon was innovative because we had no idea how to do it.","Large companies and government agencies have a lot to protect and therefore are not willing to take big risks. A large company taking a risk can threaten its stock price. A government agency taking a risk can threaten congressional investigation.","As you may know, I'm the co-founder and co-chairman of an asteroid company called Planetary Resources that is backed by a group of eight billionaires to implement the bold mission of extracting resources from near-Earth asteroids.","Back in 2007, I had the opportunity to meet Professor Stephen Hawking through the X PRIZE Foundation. In my first conversation with him I learned that he was passionate about flying into space someday.","So while I can't tell you if bringing a child into this world is the morally-responsible to do, I can say that the future, much like the present, is going to be a whole lot better than you think.","Every generation feels it has the problems that will destroy it. That's because we can perceive them a long time before we have the ability to fix them.","Eight billion people will have Internet access by 2020.","I have the general philosophy of creating the future you want to see.","By 2020 the U.S. will be short 91,000 doctors. There's no way we can educate enough doctors to make up that shortfall, and other countries are far worse off.","If you give people unlimited time and money, they'll do things the same old way. But if they have to achieve the goal in a brief time, they'll either give up or try something new.","I think that we're living in a time where there are trillion-dollar opportunities that never existed before.","Your mission is to find a product or service that can positively impact the lives of 1 billion people because that's the game we're playing today.","You might hear people decry the loss of privacy in today's world, but radical transparency is dramatically reducing violence everywhere. Most violent things happen in the dark when no one's watching, whether it's an oppressive dictator or someone causing violence in the inner city.","Millions of years ago, our brains became wired to remember about 150 people as 'close friends.'","Gossip, in its earlier forms, contained information that was critical to survival because, in clans of 150, what happened to anyone had a direct impact on everyone.","The reason we care so much about what happens to the likes of Lady Gaga is not because her shenanigans will ever impact our lives; rather because our brain doesn't realize there's a difference between rock stars we know about and relatives we know.","Once we start believing that the apocalypse is coming, the amygdala goes on high alert, filtering out most anything that says otherwise.","In the 1820s, the U.S., Japan, and the U.K. were some of the only countries where the average population received at least two years of formal schooling.","In most developed countries, the average person receives about 16 years of education. Even in developing countries, the population gets five to eight years of education.","As education becomes dematerialized, demonetized and democratized, every man, woman and child on the planet will be able to reap the benefits of knowledge. We're rapidly heading toward a world of education abundance.","Two-thirds of all growth takes place in cities because, by simple fact of population density, our urban spaces are perfect innovation labs. The modern metropolis is jam-packed. People are living atop one another; their ideas are as well.","The Net is allowing us to turn ourselves into a giant, collective meta-intelligence. And this meta-intelligence continues to grow as more and more people come online.","Never before in history has the global marketplace touched so many consumers and provided access to so many producers.","If you have a fear of flying, don't. The data are very clear: If you have to travel someplace, the safest way is by airplane.","By 2030, just a small percentage of the global population will live in poverty.","The constant monitoring of our emotional landscape and personal interactions is a bizarre concept. But it is one that could help many people.","At the turn of the 20th century, the disparity in literacy here in the U.S. largely came down to race. Nearly half of minorities at that time - 45 percent - were illiterate, while 94 percent of white citizens were literate.","We're now able to 3D print in 200 different materials, from titanium to rubber, plastic, glass, ceramic, leathers, and even chocolate.","It's easy to forget that for centuries - for millennia - the 'workforce' was all of us.","Not only are we working less, we're enjoying ourselves more. As we're working toward this world of abundance, we're able to increasingly enjoy leisure time.","We know from hard research that educated populations have lower growth rates, are more peaceful, and add to the global economy.","In 1820, the average lifespan was just 26 years. Twenty-six years!","What decisions would you make differently today if you knew you would most likely live to be 150? How would you think about your 50s or 60s? How would you evaluate your career arcs or investments or even the area in which you live?","In the early '90s, well under 5 percent of the global population was online.","In the 1940s, about 20% of people in the U.S. had graduated from high school, but less than 5% continued their education to get bachelors' degrees or higher.","WhatsApp is both disrupting and demonetizing the entire wireless industry, and now the Facebook acquisition provides the infrastructure needed for WhatsApp to begin offering voice calls. So instead of people paying on average $80 per month, users only have to pay $0.99 per year for the same services. Wireless carriers, beware.","As I've conducted my interviews with crowdsourcing entrepreneurs and experts, it's constantly hit me that your ability to do something big and bold is really a function of the size and quality of your crowd.","If anyone has seen success and failure on a global stage, it's my friend Steve Forbes.","If the idea is really new and unique and big, other people will all think it is bad and is going to fail.","When hiring, trust your feelings.","I had started Zero-G specifically to broaden the public for access to weightlessness.","I view risk-aversion as crippling America in many ways.","Did you know that Kodak actually invented the digital camera that ultimately put it out of business? Kodak had the patents and a head start, but ignored all that.","Whether it's steamships disrupted by the railroads or railroads disrupted by the airlines, it's typically the large entrenched incumbents that are displaced by innovators.","The Department of Energy made an investment that failed, and it got raked over the coals for that failed investment. This is ridiculous. The fact of the matter is, the government should be making a lot of risky investments, the majority of which are likely to fail.","As of the mid-90s, over 50 percent of women have a bachelor's and master's degree, compared to about 35 percent and 30 percent, respectively, in 1920.","It used to be that the only ones with access to cutting-edge technology were top government labs, big companies and the ultra-rich. It was simply too expensive for the rest of us to afford.","Remember when vacation photos meant toting along a bulky camera?","Because it's free, easy to use, and high-quality, photography is now a fixture in our daily lives - something we take for granted.","From a scientific point of view, we now know that the water is interlaced with the lunar soil in many locations, perhaps as remnants of comet collisions with the lunar surface.","With sufficient water on the Moon, solar energy can be used to split the water into hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen is, of course, critical for humans to breathe and the water important for us to drink.","Revealing water in significant quantities on the Moon could truly be a turning point in space exploration.","If you've been wondering where the next gold rush is going to take place, look up at the night sky to our closest celestial neighbor. The next economic boom might just be a mere 240,000 miles away on the bella luna.","Today, we don't blink an eye when the world's wealthiest individuals donate enormous sums of money to charitable causes. In fact, we expect them to do so.","If you look back 600 years ago, royals' sole goal was to keep their wealth within the family.","Large-scale philanthropy, based in the private - not the public - sector, is a relatively recent historical development.","Old-style management is irrelevant.","Future companies will be smaller and more nimble.","Collective management will build companies - not top-down decision-making.","As humans, we have evolved to compete... it is in our genes, and we love to watch a competition.","The fact that the Virgin logo was on the side of SpaceShipOne on October 4th, 2004 was fantastic.","If you stop and think about it, the form of propulsion used today hasn't changed in over a thousand years... since the invention of fireworks by the Chinese.","In the 1960s, 110 countries had averages of six or more children per family.","In 1900, 180-plus out of every 1,000 African-American babies died.","Making things open-source brings the cost down.","In 2000, just before the first dot-com bubble burst, it cost a whopping $5 million to launch a tech startup.","As of 2011, it cost about $5,000 to launch a tech startup.","It's never been easier to share your ideas and passions with the world.","Online games for data-mining have a short virtual shelf life. People get bored, especially if the game seems stagnant.","Your chances of dying a violent death are 1/500th of what they used to be during medieval times.","Today, every skirmish in every part of the planet is broadcast straight into your living room live, in HD... over and over again.","I've stopped watching TV news. They couldn't pay me enough money.","I get my news from selected Google News and my social feed.","I collect a lot of data. We all do.","A dapper Canadian in his mid-fifties, Rob McEwen bought the disparate collection of gold mining companies known as Goldcorp in 1989. A decade later, he'd unified those companies and was ready for expansion - a process he wanted to start by building a new refinery.","Imagine what we could do for the world's grand challenges with a trillion hours of focused attention.","Since the age of 6, I've always wanted to go to space.","In 1994, to motivate me to complete my pilot's license, my good friend, Gregg Maryniak, gave me Charles Lindbergh's autobiography of his solo flight across the Atlantic.","In 1980, it cost just under $600 to take a round-trip flight within the United States.","Now, we connect via Skype or Google+ Hangout and see our friends' and loved ones' faces live.","Paul Allen with Microsoft revolutionized the software industry.","I think the folks who go after grand challenges are impatient.","Lots of people dream big and talk about big bold ideas but never do anything. I judge people by what they've done. The ratio of something to nothing is infinite. So just do something.","If you're the CEO of a publicly traded company, you're worried about quarterly returns.","All of us are linear thinkers. We evolved in a world that was local and linear. You know, back 100,000, 200,000, millions of years ago, when we were evolving as a human species, nothing changed. You know, the life of your great-grandparents, you, your kids - it was the same. And so we are local and linear thinkers.","We live in a world bathed in 5,000 times more energy than we consume as a species in the year, in the form of solar energy. It's just not in usable form yet.","My feeling is that if you can make a big impact on the global literacy problem, you can uplift a big portion of society.","Many entrepreneurs that made their fortunes by founding successful technology companies want to give back and solve the world's biggest problems on a grand scale. There is tremendous opportunity in this approach.","We are effectively living in a world of communications and information abundance.","Government research has to go through peer review.","The automotive X Prize, to a great degree, is focused on addressing petroleum usage and carbon emissions.","I was seeing a lot of entrepreneurs who were effectively working on the next photo-sharing app. I wanted to inspire them to go much bigger, bolder and more significant than that.","Even in an organization that's doing something big and bold, there's the mundane, day-to-day execution work of keeping it going. But people need to stay connected to the boldness, to the vision, and stay plugged in to the main vein of the dream.","Private companies should be building businesses.","Human exploration is something that's been going on for thousands of years, and the models that worked 500 years ago are likely to work again today.","Private industry's job is to make money. Private industry's job is to create a huge economic engine.","The communications industry has been tremendously successful, but we need to build the railroads and the oil wells and the gold mines of space.","The rate of innovation is a function of the total number of people connected and exchanging ideas. It has gone up as population has gone up. It's gone up as people have concentrated in cities.","There was a Gallup poll that said something like 70 percent of people in the United States do not enjoy their job - they work to put food on the table and get insurance to survive. So, what happens when technology can do all that work for us and allow us to actually do what we enjoy with our time?","I think about things like, 'Will my kids need a college account? Will they even go to college?' I don't know if that will be the case."],"Peter Dinklage":["When people are infected by my charm, they don't see my size. My piercing deep blue eyes are distracting.","I like animals, all animals. I wouldn't hurt a cat or a dog - or a chicken or a cow. And I wouldn't ask someone else to hurt them for me. That's why I'm a vegetarian.","Each year, billions of animals are subjected to cruelty on factory farms, feed lots, and slaughterhouses. The brutality that these animals endure would be grounds for felony cruelty charges if inflicted upon our cats and dogs.","I am this guy who's four and a half feet tall, but my life doesn't constantly address it.","Any swagger is just defense. When you're reminded so much of who you are by people - not a fame thing, but with my size, constantly, growing up - you just either curl up in a corner in the dark or you wear it proudly, like armor or something. You can turn it on its head and use it yourself before anybody else gets a chance.","I never lived in an abandoned railroad station.","Anything that opens up people's perceptions a bit is good.","So I won't say I'm lucky. I'm fortunate enough to find or attract very talented people. For some reason I found them, and they found me.","There are wars being fought! Who cares what I'm doing on a Saturday night? I'm not even a celebrity.","I feel as much of a stud as... I can't come up with a metaphor. That's how lacking in studliness I am.","I spend my nights just sitting and reading a book and drinking my tea and walking my dog. That's about as exciting as my life gets.","It's a shame how a lot of actors use theater as a stepping stone to film and television work; I think it shouldn't be treated that way. Maybe it's narcissism or something. I think we should always go back to it. I try and do a play a year, and I think that's really helped me.","Call me a midget, but just be real. I am all for correct terms, but please don't tiptoe around feelings. Don't be too careful, because that shuts you off from people.","It's amazing what they can do with animation nowadays. It's really beautiful. The 3D stuff is out of hand.","I feel like life is much greater than a hero or a villain: there's good people that sometimes make mistakes.","I've felt like an outsider. I've had to struggle.","I'm not going to play my violin, but with my dwarfism, I'm a bit of a mutant.","I should call people back more readily. I'm not the best friend sometimes in terms of that. I do follow that white balloon and get distracted a lot.","Dwarves are still the butt of jokes. It's one of the last bastions of acceptable prejudice.","Maybe everyone is a little too reassuring that things are going to be OK to college graduates. It gives them a false sort of security.","I'm a private person in many ways.","I was a sullen kid who smoked cigarettes and wore black every day, and I went to a school that was lacrosse players and Izods.","A lot of parts written for people of my size, dwarfs, are either foolish idiots or, like, these sages that are all-knowing, and they're very, sort of, come-to-them-for-answers.","I have a need to always make people laugh. I have a desperate need. I love a great sense of humor. The people I sort of surround myself with have that.","I think my mom drove by a nuclear power plant when she was pregnant. But I wouldn't be in 'The Station Agent' if she hadn't.","I have a friend who says, 'The world doesn't need another angry dwarf!'","People's personalities get tweaked at weddings.","Anybody who was in 'The Godfather' is a tough guy.","I was fortunate enough to have an upbringing that made me more accepting of who I am.","The reason I like 'Breaking Bad,' which is still probably my favorite show, is Walter White. You watch him transform, and that's so fascinating. And I think. a lot of TV shows that aren't successful, it's because the characters become stagnant.","I do not fault anyone else who makes choices to play characters that they wished they hadn't... Because at the end of the day, none of us are happy with our jobs all the time.","I like playing the guy on the sidelines. They have more fun.","I love working with the same actors repeatedly. That happens a lot. It's kind of inevitable, especially if you work with the same writers and directors and you start to form a company of actors. You gravitate towards each other.","I don't socialize. I'm kind of a hermit. The life of an actor can be very lonely.","My family had a habit of collecting creatures that didn't always want to be pets. The first animal I can remember was a Lab named Zoe.","Bad guys are complicated characters. It's always fun to play them. You get away with a lot more. You don't have a heroic code you have to live by.","'Game of Thrones' is an amazing show, and I have no problem speaking of the virtues of HBO.","I think if actors are successful at one thing, they paint themselves into a corner sometimes, and what's the fun in that?","Being on television, playing the same character for many years, for me, I think that would get a little tedious.","That's one of the things about theater vs. film - with theater, actors have a little more control, and one of the disappointing things about films is that once you're done shooting, anything can happen, you know?","I think a lot of great male comic actors are introspective, quiet personalities, which I really admire. But they are really able to turn it up when the camera's on.","I was opposed to doing TV for a long time because I thought the quality of writing wasn't very strong, as opposed to film, but there's been a shift in term of the quality of scripts. HBO has attracted a tremendous amount of great writing talent.","George Martin is an incredible writer.","What I really want is to play the romantic lead and get the girl.","I just think the less you know about an actor, the more serious you'll take them as an actor because they will disappear a little bit.","I think actors get too comfortable. I like being uncomfortable as an actor because it keeps you alive. I don't know, I think it's important.","My brother, who's a violinist now, was the real ham, the real performer of the family. His passion for the violin is the only thing that kept him from being an actor.","I never was a big comic book fan. Obviously I'd heard them growing up from my friends who did read them, but I never was a big comic book reader.","I'm on 'Game Of Thrones,' and every time we have someone new coming on our show, we welcome them with open arms and get revitalised by this new presence. Then we kill them off very quickly.","I was born in 1969, believe it or not, so I was a child in the '70s.","My favourite superhero? I have a soft spot for Batman, because he doesn't have any super powers - he's just a person. And he's pretty dark.","I dress and eat like a fifth-grader, basically. I like sandwiches and cereal and hooded sweatshirts.","Writing is getting killed by too many chefs. Back in the Bogart days, it started with great scripts. You had a writer, and he wrote a script, and that was your movie. I think that's been watered down a bit lately.","I think 'No' is a very powerful word in our business that is very hard to use early on in your career. But I also think I was pretty arrogant when I was younger... I used that word maybe too much, but it did help me with finding roles that I did like.","The leads are often the boring part.","I've been to Sundance before, but I'd never seen a lot of screenings.","I have a big cynical side to me.","A lot of directors straight out of film school are very technically minded, but they don't have an understanding of actors or how to talk to them.","I don't like people being cautious and tentative and choosing their words carefully around me because I'm a dwarf.","I guess the word to call me is my name, Pete.","Jen Lawrence is quite a fan of 'Game of Thrones.'","I'm one of those who can't read the books after they've seen the movie.","We're not environmentally doing very good things to this planet, and we might not be around too long.","We, as Americans, at least - I mean, I love my country - but we're so self-righteous sometimes, in terms of, like, our nationality, our country. But we're people from somewhere else; the true 'Americans' are the original peoples. It's funny, but we're a very territorial species.","There's a thing at the Museum of Natural History in New York, where I live: they have a stairwell where you follow the beginning and the course of this planet, and it's a very long stairwell, and you follow, and you follow, and then you reach the top, and we're, like, half a step on the stairwell - the timeline for us on this planet.","Animals used for food are treated like unfeeling machinery.","Every person my size has a different life, a different history. Different ways of dealing with it. Just because I'm seemingly O.K. with it, I can't preach how to be O.K. with it. I don't think I still am O.K. with it. There's days when I'm not.","I knew David Benioff a bit socially. I knew his wife, Amanda Peet. He's a smart guy, so I always sought him out at dinner parties.","Even 'Lord of the Rings' had dwarf-tossing jokes in it. It's like, 'Really?'","As an adolescent, I was bitter and angry, and I definitely put up these walls.","It was hard doing scenes with Bobby Cannavale because I would break up laughing because he's so funny.","I would love to play Richard III.","I think more money can be very detrimental to movies and TV because things get solved economically rather than creatively, and that's never a good solution.","I think with a lot of filmmakers, their first film is their best film because they had to think on their feet and solve problems with ingenuity.","My mother was an elementary school teacher for 35 years and taught at the Nixon School in New Jersey. I was raised as a very liberal Democrat, and she was protesting Nixon when he was in office.","With a lot of shows, what you'll see happen is they start off really well, and they're very original, but they become sort of a version of themselves. They stand outside the show... they become a cliche of the show they once were. That's the whole 'jumping the shark' thing.","I think everybody goes through changes, and the same should be said for fictional characters, especially ones that you follow on television.","There are a lot of directors out there who are very specific, visual craftsmen, and while I have the utmost respect for that, they don't really communicate with the actors.","Fantasy novels, I don't really gravitate to that part of the bookstore.","I was once part of a Christmas cabaret. I sang 'I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus.' I tap-danced. I had a ten-gallon hat. It was quite absurd.","I'm recognized, let me put it that way.","You want your privacy as a human being.","I saw a report on the news: 'Peter Dinklage tweeted... ' What? You know, I don't need any of that stuff. I got an email account; that's all I need.","Sometimes on sets, I shut down, try to focus.","The greatest preparation for a TV show is to already have one season behind you.","Sometimes, when the material is really good, you put expectations on yourself to make it the best possible show. You're not just serving up the regular hash and doing your job and going home.","I never know where women are coming from.","'Star Wars' or 'The Lord of the Rings' deal with great big Joseph Campbell-style myths, good and evil.","Women respond to comfort and a sense of humor. I was always able to make them laugh, so that helps a lot.","Women on the whole are often not as shallow as men are. They can be, but they cut through things a little more easily than men do in terms of that superficial stuff.","If I was born 400 years ago instead of now, I wouldn't have the life I have. There were freak shows, and there was horrible discrimination.","They'll say, 'Oh, he's sexy,' but women still go for guys who are 6ft 2 ins. I don't believe any of it for a minute.","Since I've joined 'Game of Thrones,' it's been such a pleasure.","'Game of Thrones' fans are the nicest people ever, but a thousand nice people coming at me gives me claustrophobia.","I have a friend - not a dwarf - who's an alchemist of sorts. He concocted a men's cologne... He gave me a bottle as a gift. I was thinking we should totally put this on the market. You know how Jessica Simpson and Beyonce have signature perfumes and make a mint? I'm thinking this cologne could be my ticket to fortune.","Friends don't care about issues like dwarf tossing.","I often don't see what I've done, or I cringe when I watch myself.","Will Ferrell is just about the nicest guy - anyone can tell you that.","I just don't like boring myself. That's one of the main reasons I did 'Ice Age' - because I'd never done something like this before.","Does anybody actually go out in L.A.? When I lived there, I'd just stay in my apartment.","I like the busted-nose look. I think it's a good look for me.","Maybe in my 20s I was a little more lively. But I'm done with that.","You'd be surprised how condescending people can be.","'Lassie' was amazing. I didn't have any scenes with humans. There's a couple little bits, here or there, but mainly just me and my horse and a couple of dogs in the Isle of Man."],"Peter Doig":["It's not about perfection. What's a perfect painting? What's interesting about a perfect painting?","Painting becomes interesting when it becomes timeless.","When I was growing up, I never felt that I belonged anywhere because we never lived in a house for more than three months. That's all I knew, and that's why I don't really belong anywhere.","I don't think money can help you become a better painter, for sure. You can have all the studios you want; it won't help you make a better painting.","I do feel Scottish in some way. Maybe it's to do with visiting my grandparents here every summer as a child, but I am aware of my Scottish ancestry. It's there all right, but it would be pushing it to label me a Scottish painter. Or, indeed, an anywhere painter.","I love Trinidad and I love living there, but it's quite harsh.","I've always been an outsider. Even in London. If I returned to Scotland, I'd feel a complete foreigner.","What is bad painting? Picabia made some deliberately bad paintings, but they were by him, so great in a way.","It's still an escape for me, painting, so it also takes me elsewhere. I don't think I would do it otherwise.","I would never finish a painting if I didn't have a deadline.","I think if I was Trinidadian, I would latch more on to the myths and romanticise the place more. I don't think it's my place to do that - they're not really mine. I'm an outsider.","You cannot just be working in a vast, air-conditioned loft space and think you are going to make a decent painting. Francis Bacon had a special studio built, and he felt completely emasculated in there. I have to be somewhere comfortable.","As an artist, you are aware there is this strange money market out there, but you have no sense of how it works.","If you are someone like Jeff Koons, and you have to work out how to make a big chrome heart or something, then there are lots of people and a big production involved. The money is more natural somehow. For me, I am just on my own in the studio, trying to make things work. One thing is sure: it doesn't make painting any easier."],"Peter Drucker":["The most important thing in communication is hearing what isn't said.","Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.","The best way to predict the future is to create it.","Rank does not confer privilege or give power. It imposes responsibility.","Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right things.","Unless commitment is made, there are only promises and hopes... but no plans.","Follow effective action with quiet reflection. From the quiet reflection will come even more effective action.","The aim of marketing is to know and understand the customer so well the product or service fits him and sells itself.","The only thing we know about the future is that it will be different.","The entrepreneur always searches for change, responds to it, and exploits it as an opportunity.","Making good decisions is a crucial skill at every level.","There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.","The purpose of a business is to create a customer.","Effective leadership is not about making speeches or being liked; leadership is defined by results not attributes.","My greatest strength as a consultant is to be ignorant and ask a few questions.","Management by objective works - if you know the objectives. Ninety percent of the time you don't.","Knowledge has to be improved, challenged, and increased constantly, or it vanishes.","Plans are only good intentions unless they immediately degenerate into hard work.","We now accept the fact that learning is a lifelong process of keeping abreast of change. And the most pressing task is to teach people how to learn.","Time is the scarcest resource and unless it is managed nothing else can be managed.","Few companies that installed computers to reduce the employment of clerks have realized their expectations... They now need more, and more expensive clerks even though they call them 'operators' or 'programmers.'","Innovation is the specific instrument of entrepreneurship. The act that endows resources with a new capacity to create wealth.","Most of what we call management consists of making it difficult for people to get their work done.","Today knowledge has power. It controls access to opportunity and advancement.","Most discussions of decision making assume that only senior executives make decisions or that only senior executives' decisions matter. This is a dangerous mistake.","Never mind your happiness; do your duty.","Company cultures are like country cultures. Never try to change one. Try, instead, to work with what you've got.","Executives owe it to the organization and to their fellow workers not to tolerate nonperforming individuals in important jobs.","So much of what we call management consists in making it difficult for people to work.","No institution can possibly survive if it needs geniuses or supermen to manage it. It must be organized in such a way as to be able to get along under a leadership composed of average human beings.","The productivity of work is not the responsibility of the worker but of the manager.","Trying to predict the future is like trying to drive down a country road at night with no lights while looking out the back window.","People who don't take risks generally make about two big mistakes a year. People who do take risks generally make about two big mistakes a year.","The computer is a moron.","Teaching is the only major occupation of man for which we have not yet developed tools that make an average person capable of competence and performance. In teaching we rely on the 'naturals', the ones who somehow know how to teach.","The new information technology... Internet and e-mail... have practically eliminated the physical costs of communications.","Checking the results of a decision against its expectations shows executives what their strengths are, where they need to improve, and where they lack knowledge or information.","Accept the fact that we have to treat almost anybody as a volunteer.","Suppliers and especially manufacturers have market power because they have information about a product or a service that the customer does not and cannot have, and does not need if he can trust the brand. This explains the profitability of brands.","The most efficient way to produce anything is to bring together under one management as many as possible of the activities needed to turn out the product.","Business, that's easily defined - it's other people's money.","When a subject becomes totally obsolete we make it a required course.","We can say with certainty - or 90% probability - that the new industries that are about to be born will have nothing to do with information.","A manager is responsible for the application and performance of knowledge."],"Peter Eisenman":["Architects design houses. I live in a home.","I don't believe that classical architecture is enough to engage people anymore. They say: 'So what else is new?'","I'm not a fashion architect. I don't dress in Ralph Lauren and Gucci. When I buy a suit, I buy it at J. Press. I have a blue blazer that I wear 80 percent of the time.","Conservation destroys the present. If we are only busy preserving the past, we are not living in the present and unable to look forward. I am against conservation. We should let young people move forward, whether we agree with them or not. We should let new things happen.","I didn't know I was Jewish until I encountered anti-Semitism at the age of 10, when my best friend told me I couldn't come to their house because I was a Jew.","The guy who sits in front of the TV set with headphones on has lost the capacity to react to the tactile environment.","Architecture is definitely a political act.","I am very different as a parent to new kids. My work changed from being rooted in the sky to being rooted in the earth.","The problem with digital architecture is that an algorithm can produce endless variations, so an architect has many choices.","I would never live in anything I design. Life and art are different. My life is very precious to me - my art is precious to me. I love designing things for other people, but I don't like designing things for myself.","If you were a son of mine, I wouldn't want you to be an architect, because it's a tough way to be in the world.","I use the NordicTrack every other day for 20 minutes. I don't listen to music or watch TV while I do it. I count to myself. I count to 25; I count to 25 backwards, that sort of thing.","There's no such thing as an absolute openness. Openness is relative, I think, in all societies.","I'm a Larry David fan, right? And it seems to me that Jewish history from the Talmud on has been a self-deprecating, self-critical kind of humor.","In New York, a Jew is a Jew, an Italian is an Italian, a Muslim is a Muslim: Nobody's going out of his way to treat you in a special way.","I really don't even think of myself as being Jewish except when I'm in Germany.","The more centralized the power, the less compromises need to be made in architecture.","I am immersed in architecture all day, working in my office or teaching.","My wife has her stuff and her taste, and I have my stuff and my taste.","I was in Jungian analysis for 20 years, 1976-96.","I don't design houses with the nuclear family idea because I don't believe in it as a concept.","I truly believe that the great heroes that create the history of architecture are people who take risks and write to tell about it.","I don't know how to use appliances. I mean, I use the coffee maker. But that's it.","My father went to Rutgers, and I grew up in New Jersey, so I'm a great Rutgers fan. I have season tickets."],"Peter F. Hamilton":["If you've enjoyed 'Battlestar Galactica', you should love my stuff.","People are put off by the perception of science fiction, and it doesn't help if you've got references to quantum this and quantum that on the first page, and people think, 'This isn't for me,' and chuck it. I'm probably a pretty bad offender, given how far in the future some of my stuff is.","We spend most of our lives in relationships or bringing up children which are a product of relationships.","The whole point of science fiction is that you explore the effect of ideas on a society.","Space opera has always given authors a way to include a vast array of ideas and concepts. The opportunities it provides are limitless. Long may it reign.","Once you have extrapolated the effects a particular science will have on society - cheap clean energy, rejuvenation - the political impact is quite easy to predict. The two are twinned.","There will always be people treated badly, which I feel is basic human nature and difficult to eliminate.","I haven't yet written a book in a far-future utopia, where all bad things are eliminated, but it would be fun to do that one day and introduce some subversion."],"Peter Facinelli":["I like playing the contrasting roles. It what inspires me to act. If I look back on my career I am happy that I have gotten to play a wide variety of different roles, from Mike Dexter, to Van Ray in Fast Lane, to Dr. Cullen to Coop.","We've been shooting the last two weeks with a lot of vampires. I don't want to give away too much, but if you've read the books, it's the standoff with lots of vampires in play. There's like 70 people going through the works at once. It's a little maddening, but fun. We shot pretty much the ending of the two movies the other day.","I don't know what the future holds. I just try to do roles that I haven't done before.","Everyone has a different path. I knew no one in the acting industry growing up. I never did a play until college. I was not outspoken when I was younger and I hated being the center of attention. But I had a dream of being an actor. I went to NYU and studied theatre. I learned a craft. And began my career straight out of college.","My advice has always been to study the craft of acting if you want to be an actor. There are many great schools that teach acting. NYU being one of them.","When I was younger I saw a movie called 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' with Paul Newman and Robert Redford. Those two actors and that movie was my inspiration to want to be an actor.","It definitely gets challenging at times. I travel a lot more now, and its never easy having to leave the kids, even if its for a few days.","Last week I was in London at an awards show, then I flew home and was in an RV park with my wife and kids in our motorhome, this week I'm in NY doing a charity event, and tomorrow I'll be coaching my daughters soccer practice. I guess the range of roles I play on film stem from the range of roles I play in real life.","What I like about the third movie is you get to see a side of Carlisle you haven't seen before. You actually get to see what his vampire capabilities are because there's some great battle sequences. It's my favorite book. Carlisle is holding on to that humanity. He doesn't want to be a vampire.","There were days when I was literally running for hours in the forest and then I'd jump on a plane and then I'd be on the 'Nurse Jackie' set. I was going from Vancouver to New York every three days. For me, it was really invigorating.","I enjoy what Twitter is because I can really connect with the fans and it's a great way to share information with them and it's also a great way to entertain. I like being able to put a smile on people's faces and letting them know what I'm doing.","I like to keep my Twitter pure. I don't want to sell my followers anything."],"Peter Falk":["My idea of Heaven is to wake up, have a good breakfast, and spend the rest of the day drawing.","The entertainment industry is loaded with extraordinarily talented people. But the true, genuine originals, they're rare.","Good actors are always looking for props. They're looking for behavior. It makes it a lot easier. You're not solely dependent of what's coming out of your mouth. You're also less self-conscious, less aware of the camera.","I'm just looking to get through the day.","My father's whole life was work. He had a retail store in Ossining, New York, and I mean, he was down there at 6:15 every morning. The store didn't open until 9, but he hadda be down there. That's all he knew.","Columbo was never comfortable if somebody considered him unique or smart.","Along came a police lieutenant named Columbo, and my life would never be the same.","Hartford had the Mark Twain Masquers, which was fantastic. They had been in business I don't know how many years. They knew how to build sets and sell tickets and put on a play. My day started at night. When I left the office, that's when my day began.","To be totally sincere, I'd surely be a better actor today if I hadn't played Columbo all these years.","Initially, they wanted Columbo to wear a driving coat. I said: 'Are you kidding? He's not an English aristocrat.'","When I was young, I was looking for people to look up to - role models I could respect.","What's the name of that famous museum in Paris? The Louvre? I went through that place in 20 minutes.","I love Chicago. It's one of the great cities. I'm crazy about the town. It reminds me of New York when it was at its best, the New York that used to be and is no more. I love the architecture, the old stuff and the new stuff.","Acting is like golf: analysis leads to paralysis.","I'm old fashioned. I really think you should know how to draw before you start painting. I use charcoal and graphite; I put a skylight in. In my house, I turned the garage into an art studio. So I'm awash in art studios.","I'm not an ace at small talk.","They wouldn't take me in the navy because of my glass eye. So I joined the merchant navy, who allowed monocular crew if you worked in the kitchens. You're not wanted on deck or in the engine room with one eye, but you're good to fire up the ovens and cook hundreds of chops.","The whole thing was an actor's dream - getting a character that tickles you so much you can't wait to act as him.","Before we ever had a script or anything, I was attracted to the idea of playing a character that housed within himself two opposing traits.","I got a regret: That I started acting so late. I was 27, and guys who start at 18 or so, there's this kinda continuity of friendships they form in the profession by startin' young, I've never had that.","If it wasn't for the Mark Twain Masquers, I don't know where my life would have gone.","When I was growing up in Ossining, N.Y., playing pool with the guys, the thought that any one of us might become an actor was as far-fetched as being knighted by the queen of England.","It helps an actor an awful lot when he looks like the part. There's nothing more disconcerting, that makes you more anxious or more insecure, than when you don't look like who you're supposed to be.","Children ran up to me shouting, 'Columbo!' At first, it gave me great pleasure, but later, I said to myself that those children should have had their own heroes instead of admiring a cop from Los Angeles.","I am older than everyone I ever knew. All my dogs are dead. Half a dozen cats, parakeets... all gone.","I remember being amazed that actors had a union. I thought only coal miners had unions, or guys that worked in automobile plants. That's an indication of how naive I was.","In 1958, I was shooting a movie in Florida, and I decided to go to Havana, Cuba, to see what it was like.","It became the joke of the neighbourhood. If the umpire ruled me out on a bad call, I'd take the fake eye out and hand it to him.","The female body is awesome.","Usually, I get hired because I'm tall.","I didn't become an actor until I was an old man of 28 or 29. I declared to the world that I was an actor. Nobody heard me, but I did declare it.","I had two ambitions: One was to be in The Actors Studio, and the other was to walk into a bar where actors hung out, and everyone would know that I was a professional actor and I would be accepted.","You thought the stage, you thought Broadway: that was the pot at the end of the rainbow. The idea of being in Hollywood was like going to the Moon or Mars.","If your mind is at work, we're in danger of reproducing another cliche. If we can keep our minds out of it and our thoughts out of it, maybe we'll come up with something original.","I came to Hollywood and nobody knew me. I was on a coupla TV shows.","I did do my own stunts.","I never understood a word John Cassavetes said. And I think he did that deliberately.","The only mountain that I would still like to climb: I'd like to break 85.","You talk about what a director, he was smart. He said, Turn the camera on!","I've worked with some terrific actors. The list of guys that came on the 'Columbo' show, I mean they were world-class actors from all over the world - Oskar Werner, Laurence Harvey, Donald Pleasence, you know... foreigners.","The first time I ever spoke to John Cassavetes was at a Lakers game. I got up to go for a hot dog, and he was coming in the opposite direction. I don't know who said hello first, but we started talking, and it turned out that he went to high school with my first wife, Alice.","In the theater, you didn't have any marks. Your instincts in rehearsal told you what the blocking was. On film, they reversed it. They decided ahead of time what your instincts were, before you even arrived.","Even the first year of 'Columbo,' 'Columbo' was Jesus Christ, No. 1, you know.","I still get fan mail for Columbo.","I watch practically no TV - ah, what the hell do I watch? Oh, I was for a long time addicted to CNN.","When I was a kid growing up, you maybe secretly wanted to be an actor, but you never said.","I wanted to become an actor, but I didn't want to admit it.","When I go see a basketball game, I'm always in the front row. I always have a table at a restaurant; I never have trouble getting a taxi.","I just keep working.","I've never worried about the grand concepts.","I do figure every angle of a guy I'm acting - but not consciously 'til afterward.","When I was a kid, the idea of gettin' paid to paint your face... listen, I grew up in Ossining, New York, a nice little town by the Hudson, and nothin' ever interested me except being your usual high school big shot, which I was an' loved it, played all the sports and goofed around, always out on the street with the guys, everything was funny t'me.","Sometimes I was in school plays, but only when the kid they'd originally picked got sick and they asked me to substitute.","I was a street-guy villain. I was a street-corner villain. I was an illiterate villain. All rough edges.","I had no idea when I graduated from high school and then from graduate school what I wanted to do with my life. I had no idea that I was ever going to be an actor.","Going to Hartford turned out to be the luckiest thing that ever happened to me.","The celebrity craze is a little much. But it's good for me, so you don't bite the hand that feeds you.","I like stories that grow, that have unpredictable layers. As opposed to Hollywood movies that start out with a lot of shock and noise and peter out into an unconvincing cliche.","I thought actors were artists and that artists had to be European.","There were no artists in Ossining, which was the home of Sing Sing prison. Most of the parents of the guys I knew were guards there.","In the beginning, when you're acting in amateur theater and off-Broadway, it was unheard of that anyone else would get your costume. And it was important to get a good costume. You put time into that.","I used to have this idea that you can spend years in the movies and TV and then, at the drop of a hat, say 'Oh, I'll go back and do the theater.'","To be a theater actor, I think you have to do plays all the time.","Sure, I miss some things about the stage. The thing I like is the immediacy. But then I complain, 'I gotta do the same part for six months.'","There's a bit of a problem. The script that I like, the network doesn't like. The script that they like, I don't like.","I think people identify with Columbo because he is an average man.","I lose things. I am preoccupied. I am misty. Eyeglasses? I go through eyeglasses like tissue.","I used to dread somebody saying, 'Whatsa matter with your eye?'","You think you're in another civilization, another time, and then you see antennas coming out of these hovels, and your mouth falls open when you see the descendants of the Incas shouting 'Columbo! Columbo!'","I used to take girls out on a date to Night Court. And I'll tell you, most girls, they got a kick out of going to Night Court. 'Cause you get a lot of laughs... and it's cheap.","What wouldn't have happened to me if I hadn't ended up in Hartford, Connecticut.","If I'm a guy reading a newspaper, and I hear this actor who I know gets great seats at basketball games, and he's complaining about being typecast, I think, 'Hey man, count your blessings.'","God didn't design anyone to be recognized by 2 billion people.","There isn't an Eskimo who doesn't love 'Columbo.'","Strange thing, this television.","I'm secretly very stuffy.","I've been asked a few thousand times how much of Columbo is Falk and vice versa.","The truth is, no one is like Columbo.","Oh, I was some efficiency expert. On my first day, I couldn't find my own office in Hartford and wound up in the Post Office.","I hate to talk about typecasting, because being typecast as Columbo ain't cancer.","I'm makin' a lotta dough, everyone knows who you are, and who the hell cares whether you're typecast or not? Also, there's something wrong with complaining about being typecast in something you really enjoy doing.","Certainly, you envy the guys that have done all kinds of things, a variety of good scripts and good directors. Then again, having worked with Cassavetes has satisfied a big part of that.","I never turned a part down when they offered me money.","Your instincts for what's dramatic are the same whether you're working on a drawing or on a script.","In order to be totally spontaneous, you can't be too obsessed with accuracy, but if you're inaccurate in a drawing, it will look fake, and when you act, it will sound fake. You have to find miraculously some proper balance between the two, but there's no formula.","Actors know one thing: If you're left just with words, you're in trouble.","I once did a film in Russia because I wanted to see what the hell was going on there.","I've been there a thousand years, and I never felt comfortable. Beverly Hills - when I first saw it, I thought they put it up this morning. You got to pack water to get to the drugstore.","I don't like getting up in the morning, getting in a car, driving on a freeway, and stopping at a gate where two guards are standing there, then walk into a studio that looks like a bunch of airplane hangars.","I don't dwell on it. But I guess everybody hopes that they go in their sleep and that it won't be long and painful.","My wife loves to get all dressed up and go out, and I'm this gloomy Virgo. It works because of the mutual recognition that we are two democratic narcissists. She does what she has to do, and I do what I have to do. We respect that.","It depends how lenient you are with your definition of artist. If you're going to include those who tap dance at the high school recital, then maybe I am.","If you were brought up in the '40s, a kid in Ossining, New York, hanging out at the poolroom and stealing, how can you think, 'Here I am in Ossining. I, too, can be a movie star!'","Everybody wants to be a movie star. I bet if you ask that guy would he like to be a movie star, he'd say, 'Sure.'","Most people think glamor is happiness."],"Peter Farrelly":["Everything's a lot easier when you work with someone you know just about as well as you know yourself.","Our feeling is that the most important thing on a set is that actors have enough confidence to try different things. If there's stress or tension, they won't go out on a limb because they won't want to embarrass themselves if they don't feel completely comfortable.","There are a lot of laughs in this movie, but it's not just about the laughs. It's really about the story, about a guy who finds his soul and realizes what's truly important.","I know this is silly, it's shallow, it's bad, I wish I wasn't this way-but if I meet a girl with no teeth, I just don't want to date her. It's creepy of me, I wish I was a bigger person, but that's my real turn-off.","We've had no problems with the actors, but we keep a really loose set.","Nine out of 10 times these guys will hit it-they'll be on something incredibly funny, but one out of 10, two out of 10, they'll fall flat on their faces. That's what makes them great actors: they take those chances, they don't play it safe.","If you work with Jim Carrey, you're working with the best.","We really love all sports, but we don't think in the long term. The reason we did Kingpin was because there was a script we really liked and we saw the possibilities.","Anybody who is a fan of any team is going to recognize themselves in this.","I always take kind of a zen view of casting and I really don't remember people who passed. I kind of turn it over to the universe and figure, 'Wow, I guess that wasn't meant to be.' It doesn't sit with me.","I always loved Kate Winslet, but after you meet her you really love her because she's a cool chick.","If I was not allowed to mention that I was in the film industry, I could go six months without getting a kiss.","'Movie 43' is about the hardest R Rated comedy ever.","I do know this: When somebody has to look great on the screen, that's the death of funny.","Usually, you can shoot a movie in 10 or 12 weeks.","I know guys. I know the way they think.","You know, I'm not sure I ever even had a blind date!","With all of my films if I get one bad review and a bunch of good reviews the bad one is the only one that will stay with me, which really sucks!"],"Peter Fenn":["A basic tenet of a healthy democracy is open dialogue and transparency.","President Barack Obama has it right - there is a lot to change about Washington. The problem is, not much will get changed unless we confront the runaway filibuster in the U.S. Senate.","In the first 50 years of the filibuster, it was used only 35 times. But the last Congress alone had 112 cloture motions filed, plus threats of more. This is the tyranny of the minority."],"Peter Fenton":["In open source, you really have to be near the watershed to have an impact on the source code. Customers want to be near the key contributors to the code, not a level removed.","We approached Yahoo and Jerry Yang and said that Hadoop is going to continue to be popular, and as it does, more and more of your team is going to get poached by other companies and come under pressure to leave. This way, you can control your own fate and destiny.","The rise of Twitter defined 2011. Once every 5-7 years, a company emerges that changes not just the technology industry, but the world... after what some viewed as a rocky start, in 2011 Twitter broke through into the elite group of companies that profoundly shape our world.","Bailing on a company is just something you don't do.","In open-source in general, the power lies in connecting the author of the software directly to users, eliminating the middleman.","If you don't have the best product, you're not going to make it in open-source.","What Google did in Web 1.0 was take a feature, which was search, and built an entire business around that utility. In Web 2.0, Twitter took a feature, which is sharing, and built a utility that allowed people to do that on a massive scale.","My biggest mentor has been the Benchmark partnership. We have six partners and a flat structure, and everyone is paid the exact same paycheck. It's a team model versus an individual model.","We actually tried to invest in Twitter in April 2007, right when it launched. At the time, the company was wary of having a classic, tier-one traditional venture firm involved.","The one I have the most angst towards would be YouTube. We had an opportunity to invest, and I just got nervous about the media industry's response to the unlicensed content on the site."],"Peter Finch":["Success is not two cars or a swimming pool. It's the approval of your peers.","Success is a very tough mistress. For years, while you're struggling, she wants nothing to do with you. Then one day, you find yourself in the room with her, and even though the key is on the inside, you can't leave.","The parts of a film should be in proportion to the whole, and a long film pasted together out of quick little scenes makes me dizzy.","For some peculiar reason, two films about Oscar Wilde were started at the same time, back in 1959 or 1960. I played Wilde in one, and Robert Morley was in the other. As it turned out, at that particular moment there was no market for any Oscar Wilde movie at all.","Good acting should teach people to understand rather than judge.","If I'm going through life broke, I might as well live in the company of cheerful idiots like actors.","If you have 50 years in the business, you can probably count on only five good movies.","Hollywood must have been terrific once.","I do not believe that with a fictional character you can force yourself too far away from yourself. There has to be some of you in it.","Most of the time, I'm pleased that people don't recognize me. But I don't hate it when they do.","I don't want to get on the treadmill of earning more money. I'd rather live cheaply and allow myself more freedom. I can honestly say I've never taken a film just for the dough, although I've made some ghastly mistakes."],"Peter Fonda":["It's wonderful to me that bees have this simple, age-old thing going on.","Henry Fonda's son: That's how everybody identified me until Easy Rider came along. Good old Captain America.","It took us a long time to find out that we had been lied to by our parents' generation. The moralities that were followed during our parents' generation were basically arbitrary. This caused a rift between the two generations, which was brought on by the beatniks.","My abilities grow with each job, whether it's writing or directing. When I stop learing, I'll stop working.","I have always maintained that society has no business dictating morality.","I was famous from birth.","You don't become the character.","When Jane and I spoke out, people thought, What ungrateful children those two kids are to be that nasty about their father.","The word courage - God, I love that word. Words are so important to me.","Remember, Alan Greenspan was a member of Ayn Rand's collective. To understand this is to understand why we are doomed with the Federal Reserve.","People ask me from time to time what it was like growing up with Henry Fonda as my father. I say, Ever see Fort Apache? He was like Colonel Thursday.","My actual intake of different substances was far below what people thought it was, no matter how weird or outrageous they think I am.","Lennon was not very fond of me. Lennon didn't like to be around somebody else who was likely to be the center of attention and didn't like being on deck with somebody who was intellectually as hot as he was.","If I have enough ego to say I'm a writer, a director, a producer, and an actor, I should have the energy and the knowledge to write a scene for this great actor named Henry Fonda and direct him in it and have it work.","I've always internalized things.","I wasn't really aware that my father was working for quite a while. I thought it was my mother who had all the money!","I was named Beekeeper of the Year by the Florida State Beekeeping Association.","I want to die in the saddle. I love writing, producing, acting, directing.","I want to be on set and die hearing those words: Where's Peter?","I truly miss the genius of the music of John Lennon, as I'm sure everybody does.","I love to direct my daughter, and act with her, and we both want to work with Jane again.","I know I'm responsible for not having got the kind of roles that I'd have liked to. '","I knew Henry Fonda was my father, but I didn't know who I was. They all thought of me as Henry Fonda's son. Unfortunately for them, they never got to know me.","I don't trust anybody who didn't inhale.","I always seemed to disappoint them. They expected me to be different than Henry or exactly like Henry. I was neither.","Getting out from under the shadow of Henry Fonda was difficult.","Every director is so different from every other one.","Brando's a family friend. His mother gave my father a shot to be in a play at the Omaha Community Playhouse. That was the first production he was in.","Bob Dylan is out of the mentorship of Allen Ginsberg."],"Peter Forsberg":["Well, you have your regular classes, like three hours every other day, three times a week. You get twice a week to have an ice practice. Once a week you have weight lifting. It was great.","It's always good to get a goal on your first shift, but this was a game it seemed everything was going in.","It's not only hockey, it's every sport. You know, it's a big event.","We had a great group of guys when I was there, five of us, I think. It's a great competition. Every practice was hard. I think that's helped us a lot, everybody that was there.","I wouldn't accept losing as a team, wouldn't accept losing as my team. It's like a war every practice. I think it helped us a lot.","It's only 60,000. It's not a big town. It's a big hockey town. Everybody plays hockey when you grow up.","Pretty it's pretty good for me because I'm over here in the winters. It's really improved my golf game.","It's been a good hockey life for me anyway.","Of course, I'm sour that if (retirement) happens, I didn't get to quit on my own terms."],"Peter Fraser":["The government's objective, broadly expressed, is that all persons, whatever their level of ability, whether they live in town or country, have a right as citizens to a free education of the kind for which they are best fitted and to the fullest extent of their powers.","The images attempt to capture scientific thought. They represent the physical manifestation of the thought process. Everything in the laboratory is a product of a stream of conscious or unconscious thought.","Schools that are to cater for the whole population must offer courses that are as rich and varied as are the needs and abilities of the children who enter them."],"Peter Gabriel":["I think another thing is that we don't really want exclusivity. We accept that it is in the artist's interest to be on sale in every place where they sell music.","I'm a bit cynical that it ever will be addressed properly. I think it is healthy to get some sort of copyright protection. But some of it has gone on forever.","I think it is the weak and the young and the minorities that you need to look after to get a healthy creative environment - to get a lot of choices, a lot of different styles of music, a lot experimental stuff that everyone else feeds off.","Sometimes a creative environment affects what happens within it.","I think one of the things about writing in the studio is that the song hasn't matured, if you like, so quite often the vocals are early attempts. Whereas once you've taken it out on the road a bit, you learn more about a song.","I think that you get the mood of a song stronger if you get it right that way. On the other hand, you put some songs out live and they don't catch flight. They just flop. It is hard to tell until they are out there.","One thing that really appeals to me is this idea of music being a living thing that has an evolution that, in a way, enables the artist to sell a process rather than a piece of product.","The industry does have some influence on who gets other awards. With the Mercury Prize, they don't. Jon comes from the business, but his heart is still very much in the music. Currently, we have about 12 major names that have said they want to be a part of MUDDA.","I didn't leave the band to go solo so much as to stop feeling like a production item.","You have independent films and independent music, but you don't have independent theme parks - I think, in a way, Burning Man is as close, probably, as you get.","What intrigues me is that you get a good bunch of musicians together, and interesting things will happen.","Art suggests stuff that is traded like money, that is kept in galleries and that belongs to the elite, whereas experience is something that everybody has in the course of living.","Italian food is my favorite food. It's the most sophisticated eating system.","A record for us that sells 50,000 is a good record, and 100,000 is a serious hit.","If we grab technology and adapt it and make it work for us, it will work in one way, whereas if we just leave it, it will stay in the hands of big corporations and governments, who have other agendas.","I think the rhythm is like the spine of the piece. If you change that, then the body that forms around it is changed as well.","I'm trying to enlarge what I do with my voice, not through technique but just through the sounds. I think we all make noises, and particularly when we get involved or emotional about something, the colors and the tones of those noises change.","The American record company Geffen got so fed up with me that they said they weren't going to release my fourth record unless I gave it some title. So it was called 'Security' in America, and it had no title everywhere else in the world.","In some ways, I'm just a visual person.","As we become so visible in the digital world and leave an endless trail of data behind us, exactly who has our data and what they do with it becomes increasingly important.","Snowden's revelations shocked the world and made it very clear why we need to have some way to look over those who look over us. With increasing terrorist attacks, security is critical, but not without any accountability or oversight.","I was very happy to learn Oliver Stone had decided to make a film about Edward Snowden and believe this is a powerful and inspiring film.","There's a Slow Food movement. I think I'm part of the Slow Music movement.","Happy music that is genuinely joyful is probably the hardest music to write. I think miserable stuff is more natural to the human condition and maybe more cathartic.","As you get older, some top notes drop off and bottom notes appear, which I quite like. You listen to Leonard Cohen or Johnny Cash, and you see the advantage of the lower end.","I'm often guilty of overcooking and too much arrangement and throwing too much at it. But I think as I get older, I'm learning better when to be empty and when to be full.","It took me three albums to get the confidence and to find out what I could do that made me different from other people. And the first record, really, was a process of trying.","I really wanted the first record to be different from what I'd done with Genesis, so we were trying to do things in different styles.","When I left Genesis, I just wanted to be out of the music business. I felt like I was just in the machinery. We knew what we were going to be doing in 18 months or two years ahead. I just did not enjoy that.","Studios always seem to be in basements without natural light and with black everything.","As many an architect will tell you, human behavior changes according to the environment.","I've talked to a lot of artists - painters, writers, musicians - many of whom have had great ideas on trains. The only explanation I have is all that stuff is coming at you while you're relaxed, so somehow it kicks you into hyperspace in terms of brain function."],"Peter Gallagher":["To stay on the map you've got to keep showing up.","My eyebrows make a more profound impact on other people than they do on me. I just let 'em grow.","Whether it's on top of a phone booth or a $200 million soundstage, it's about stories.","I made my Broadway debut in the revival of Hair and followed it up with the bus and truck tour of Grease.","When I came up, guys like Nicholson and DeNiro were held in highest regard.","In an attempt to amuse my friends and family, I would do impressions of Dean Martin, singing Everybody Loves Somebody. I secretly really enjoyed singing the song.","My family were broadminded enough to support me when I wanted to pursue a life in the theatre.","I was about to get a degree in economics when I accepted that I'd be a lousy businessman, and if I didn't give acting a try I'd regret it for the rest of my life.","Around 5th and 6th grade I thought Dean Martin was the coolest guy in the world; he was a great singer, had his own television show and acted in movies.","There have been makeup artists who've asked if my eyebrows are real.","Two women? God, man. Well, I'm still living. So clearly I must've gotten away with it, when I did do it. But I don't think it's time to blow my cover now.","I love playing a dad. It's hard to find family dramas that are genuinely funny.","By year three, you get nicer, bigger trailers.","I always go back to theatre. It's probably where I'll draw my last breath.","I feel like I won the Lotto, as far as that show's concerned.","No matter what the role, you're trying to do the impossible - make a living in show business.","Through every moment on stage for the first time, I felt like I was finally right where I belonged.","You can only be stupid when you're young.","I was probably 11 by the time I saw a movie."],"Peter Garrett":["Some people are born with the necessary gift, and some work hard to build on the few gifts they have.","That was the crossover line for us, to be able to play that many shows, sell them out real quick and have that tribe queue up outside and still be a mystery to everybody else.","Climate change is such a huge issue that it requires strong, concerted, consistent and enduring action by governments.","The forces that are in play on climate change essentially revolve around the generation of power, the transportation of goods and services and people, and the sorts of materials that we use to fuel the whole of our civilisation.","There was never going to be a right time for a band that was still recording and had health in its environment, had made a very good record and was playing well.","The Capitol was an occasion where you arrive at a sign in the road that says you have arrived at a place you may not have expected to be, but you know how you got here: Next!","As far as performance, the roar of the crowd, the smell of the greasepaint no I don't feel that.","In particular, Australia, because of its ancient geography, soil profile and distinctive weather patterns, is more adversely affected by climate variability than some other continents.","There are a range of associated impacts related to increasing temperatures which affect both evaporation rates and river systems, which are already over stressed, and these will hit farming communities and the health of crop lands.","Look, very clearly there are things that need to be done urgently in relation to climate change, and of those the most obvious is to have an enforceable and equitable arrangement delivering deep cuts in emissions into the middle of the century.","It's absolutely not acceptable for people to argue that, if we are going to do anything about climate change at all, well, the responsibility lies solely with the individual.","And given that there's been probably a ten-fold amount of information about terrorism through the media than there has about climate change; I think that's quite an interesting statistic.","Recently though, our State Governments have discussed instigating a carbon trading scheme - the details are still to be decided - and that's an encouraging sign.","Climate change is also clearly a matter of huge interest and concern for the scientific community.","Once you start to look into the guts of climate change you find that just about every scientific institution in the world is conducting research on the issue.","I believe that the quantum of our knowledge will increase considerably in the coming years and that scientists will continue to be amongst the brave voices speaking out.","The fact is that we take music very seriously.","In our early period we pretty much survived or perished on our capacity to reach people, and on getting into the pattern of having no money and playing lots of shows.","Our career path has tended to be the most perverse and contrary approach to the entertainment industry imaginable, while at the same time doing the kinds of things that you have to do, the videos, the photos and all that sort of stuff.","You don't want to spend your life explaining yourself.","I guess for me what is more significant than success is the nature of each of the songs and of the words.","At an everyday level I would reckon myself more than fortunate.","And living in Australia I am relatively well off.","I don't blame my own parents for the way I grew up, as quite often there is little choice in these issues.","I haven't chosen to make an issue of faith.","The place where the system and people's intentions meet is the political arena.","What generally happens in this county is that our politicians don't serve us well because they don't tell the truth, and they don't keep their promises.","Our senses convey that all is not well with the natural world.","I believe the divine is part of the world, not in a pantheistic way but by way of the movement of the Spirit."],"Peter Gay":["Every historian has informally an anthropology, without ever using the word.","There is something very intriguing about, for example, the sense of accomplishment that a small child has, which you might be able to reduce to aggression and libido, but which might also have some independent existence.","What interests me, and has always interested me, has been modernism.","My definition of modernism took a while to develop.","And my interest in history was, and remains, very strong: what I wanted was to understand certain things better by understanding them psychoanalytically.","My assumption is that fundamentally the picture of the human animal, as developed by Freud, is largely right.","People seem to forget that one reason they are now thinking differently is Freud's legacy itself.","To have a liberal temperament is a kind of psychological boon, To be able to understand that someone you disagree with is not just a terrible creature but somebody with whom you disagree."],"Peter George Peterson":["The Democrats in particular are do-nothing guys.","Many Republicans have what I call a 'tax-cut syndrome' where they have never seen a tax cut they didn't really like and didn't see a tax increase they didn't hate and do everything they could to block.","I've known Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles and they're two of the most independent people I've ever known in my life, and the thought we could somehow bend their views I find really beyond my capacity to believe."],"Peter Gould":["I wrote a spec script that people really liked: a political serial based on Jeffrey's Toobin's 'A Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy.' It was the first thing I had ever written with any political subject matter in it.","I think of myself more as a filmmaker or as a film person than as strictly just a writer. I don't come out of playwriting or anything like that.","For 'Breaking Bad,' our offices were in the ugliest building in Burbank, California. Which, if you know Burbank, is really saying something.","I love scenes with minimal dialogue.","The scene we shot with Charlie Rose was actually the last piece that was ever shot for 'Breaking Bad.' My daughter and I flew to New York; we got to shoot in the 'Charlie Rose' studio. Adam Godley and Jessica Hecht are such expert performers that we were able to get it very beautifully and very quickly.","The problem and the question on 'Breaking Bad' is always 'Where is Walt's head at?'","The great thing about writing is that you always put yourself in the shoes of the character. If you're doing it right, you can see into the heart of all your characters. Usually, when there's a writing problem, it's because you aren't doing that.","I think the ultimate thing in some ways for any writer is to work on a character who's going to have a life for a long time."],"Peter Graves":["You cannot simplify human intelligence, emotion, and growth. To watch the frills and furbelows of a human psyche is fascinating.","You can do bad parts in good pictures or good parts in bad pictures and maybe get a little personal satisfaction. But the key to it all is good parts in good pictures.","I think we were born 6 feet tall and then started to grow from there. My dad's not particularly tall - only 5 feet, 11 inches - but his mother was almost 6 feet and straight as a ramrod: a German woman who used to scare the hell out of me.","I, personally, like good clothes. I appreciate a fine tailored suit, and I'm impressed with the expansion of color in men's wardrobes.","I had several turtles before they were in. People seemed to think they were funny. Now everyone is wearing them practically every place. I think that's real fine, but I don't agree they should go to a formal affair. Turtlenecks with dinner jackets seem ridiculous to me.","I'm proud of 'Mission: Impossible.' It made me famous beyond my wildest dreams.","Every actor starting out wants to be famous. One of my dreams was always to go to Paris, walk up the Champs Elysees, and be recognized, and by God, it happened!","I don't know the secret of 'Mission: Impossible''s success. If I did, I'd have probably produced a couple of TV series, made myself rich, and retired!","Most shows get dumped by the networks, do a couple of years in syndication, then they're in the vault. 'Mission: Impossible' has never been off the screen.","People have asked me whether I have a science background. No, but I have a great curiosity about the kinds of things we do on 'Discover.'","In drama, you're interacting with other actors to tell the story. The camera is like the theater: it's the artistic fourth wall. In a screen play, you don't look at the camera and communicate with it. But with hosting, you're looking right into the lens and talking to the people. It is a different style, and it's fascinating.","Every actor starts out saying, 'I can play anything in the world: I'm only 25, but I can be a man 70 years old. I'll put on a gray wig and do it.' But nobody hires you for that. You have to play yourself on the screen.","I'm trying to get through life without really knowing about computers, but I don't know if I am going to make it.","I resent the label on cigarettes. If they're going to warn you, why don't they put the same sign at the entrance to every freeway or on every banana that's sold? You can slip on the peel, you know.","It takes a while to establish a character. Richard Boone once told me he didn't really get the character in 'Have Gun - Will Travel' until the 16th show. You just plant a seed, water it, let the sun shine on it, and hope it blooms."],"Peter Greenaway":["All religions have always hated females.","We all know that we're going to die, but we don't know when. That's not a blessing, that's a curse.","If you want to tell stories, be a writer, not a filmmaker.","I think that films or indeed any art work should be made in a way that they are infinitely viewable; so that you could go back to it time and time again, not necessarily immediately but over a space of time, and see new things in it, or new ways of looking at it.","The Sistine Chapel is an extraordinary work of education - it lays out all the early books of the Bible.","I don't want to be a film-maker. I think painting is far more exciting and profound.","As for critics, one mediocre writer is more valuable than ten good critics. They are like haughty, barren spinsters lodged in a maternity ward.","Cinema basically examines a personality first and the body afterward.","I think that every artist dreams of renewing the forms which came before, but I think very few can be considered to have achieved that. We are all dwarves standing upon the shoulders of the giants who preceded us, and I think we must never forget that. After all, even iconoclasts only exist with respect to that which they destroy.","Anybody who writes a diary insists it must be read by someone else.","I always think that art is one of the most wonderful exciting curious ways to learn. I have no worries or apologies about art being used as a teaching medium.","I've always been fascinated by Eisenstein.","In a world where we can all be our own filmmakers, the old elites are disappearing and there is no desire to look at somebody else's dream anymore because you can go off and make your own.","I admit that death is not just about you, it's also about the people who love you.","I can't think of anyone who has done anything remotely useful after the age of 80.","English culture is highly literary-based.","I obviously irritate people. I obviously antagonise them.","I suppose I am gently cynical about notions of who we think we are, but I certainly don't hate my fellow man. I think my cinema, although it might often deal with death and decay, is highly celebratory.","I think my films are always quite self-reflexive and always question 'why am I doing this, is this the right way to do it, what is cinema for, does it have a purpose?'","I don't believe in the deplorable notion of realism in the cinema: you can over-reach it, and it becomes as false as convention.","For so many filmmakers, cinema is a means to an end."],"Peter Guber":["Stories aren't the icing on the cake; they are the cake!","Truth is a point of view, but authenticity can't be faked.","Language is a more recent technology. Your body language, your eyes, your energy will come through to your audience before you even start speaking.","Without social cohesion, the human race wouldn't be here: We're not formidable enough to survive without the tactics, rules and strategies that allow people to work together.","Nothing replaces being in the same room, face-to-face, breathing the same air and reading and feeling each other's micro-expressions.","I think any new technology that helps connect and create social cohesion is great. But at the end of the day, you and I are analog creatures. We have to take 'oohs and aahs' and convert them to 0s and 1s and then convert them back to 'oohs and aahs.' Narratives that work in social networks are the exchange of stories that are told well.","The seminal elements of what makes a story great - challenge, struggle, resolution - are the same whether we're talking about story content for a movie such as 'Rain Man,' or telling a purposeful story to forge new business relationships or conclude a fruitful transaction, such as acquiring an NBA franchise.","In any situation that calls for you to persuade, convince or manage someone or a group of people to do something, the ability to tell a purposeful story will be your secret sauce. Telling to win through purposeful stories is situation, industry, gender, demographic, and psychographic-agnostic. It's an all-purpose, everyone wins tool.","The portal into people's hearts is being interested in them.","I never look in the rearview mirror.","Telling purposeful stories is interactive. It's not a monolog. Ultimately, purposeful tellers must surrender control of their stories, creating a gap for the listener(s) to willingly cross in order to take ownership. Only when the listener(s) own the tellers' story and make it theirs, will they virally market it.","Use state-of-the-heart technology online and offline to turn listeners into viral advocates and customers into raving fans.","Well, the idea is that failure is an inevitable partner on the road to success and, if you're not willing to confront failure, you can never find out how good you are.","Think about all the great leaders. Think about Obama. Think about Clinton. Think about Nelson Mandela. Think about all the people that we know who are very successful in business, in politics and religion. What are they? They tell purposeful stories. They move people to action by aiming at the heart.","There's a sense of aliveness that comes from connection, shared experience. And you see it in every place. You see it when ball players jump up and down, gather at home plate, hugging, and it's not just because they're winning, it's that shared moment, that feeling of - we enter the world alone, we leave alone.","When you want to move somebody, you have to say to yourself: 'I'm in the emotional transportation business. I gotta move them, emotionally.'","In today's roller-coaster economy, hyper-competitive, fear-based, flat and global world, convincing anyone to do anything at any time requires getting their attention, creating their intention and turning it to action.","'Tell to Win' reveals the key elements that tellers of purposeful stories utilize to engage their listeners and turn them into viral advocates of the tellers' goals.","The magic happens when you take facts and figures, features and benefits, decks and PowerPoints - relatively soulless information - and embed them in the telling of a purposeful story. Your 'tell' renders an experience to your audience, making the information inside the story memorable, resonant and actionable.","The arts tend to be more liberal. There tends to be more social relevance in the arts.","So when you tell a joke, you want to make someone laugh, or if you tell a story about someone who had a heart attack, it may be because you want the listener to exercise. Stories are tools to create social cohesion and to get humans to strategize together.","Most young people haven't used their storytelling skills since they were 8 or 9 or 10 and wanted to persuade Mom and Dad to take them to the ball game.","I was born curious.","The idea is, we're still a society where we recognize and see and even sometimes seek members of our own tribe, whatever that tribe is. It could be ethnic, religious, geographic, political.","We tend to become social core groups, whatever our similar interest and background where we came through. It tends to be a filter through which people see themselves. It can be all different ethnicities. They can see themselves as San Franciscans, or Warriors fans. You want to build a tribe of viral advocates for that team.","Tribalism isn't a bad thing. If you're a Facebook user, or Twitter user or Foursquare user or LinkedIn user, those are all tribes... and they may even have sub-tribes. It's not pejorative, it's declarative.","Beside every great success are the seeds of enormous failure. In every failure, there's the opportunity seeds of great success. They're not miles apart. So if they're that close together, and if you're really working, you're always gonna have that likelihood that something's not going to work.","Are you motivated? Are you coherent? Is your intention aligned? Are your feet, tongue, heart and wallet congruent? That intention shines through.","Nothing drew me to the film business. I was propelled by the fear and anxiety of Vietnam. I had been drafted into the Marines. My brother was already serving in Vietnam. I bought, if you will, a stay of execution - both literally and figuratively - and went on to graduate school of business from the law school that I was attending.","The minute you start the process of deciding to make a film and you're communicating that vision to anyone, you're in the process of selling. If you don't understand that, you're not in show business. You're just not.","The reality is that every movie is a new business. Nobody says, 'Hey, let's go down to the Pantages Theater, I hear a Warner Brothers picture is playing there.' Or, 'Let's go to this theater, I hear the film came in on budget.' It'd be ridiculous.","People love to be swept off their feet, to go into an environment where they've never been, to experience things they only dream about. And filmmaking offers that potential.","Social cohesion was built into language long before Facebook and LinkedIn and Twitter - we're tribal by nature. Tribes today aren't the same as tribes thousand of years ago: It isn't just religious tribes or ethnic tribes now: It's sports fans, it's communities, it's geography.","When somebody is enthusiastic about a job opportunity - but gives off the feeling that this is not the only one they have on the table - they become more seductive in the employer's eyes. You become more desirable because it shows that you're making a conscious and thoughtful decision for the right reasons.","At Casablanca we did 'Midnight Express,' 'Flashdance,' and 'The Deep.' My willingness for risk has always been my strength.","I've worked with Jack Warner and Jimmy Stewart - and Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, and Johnny Depp twice. I've had dinners with Fred Astaire and Cary Grant.","Every journey that is successful has culs-de-sac and speed bumps. I carry a wisdom gene through my life through the good, the bad, and the ugly.","A gun can be dangerous. But a gun can protect you, you can hunt for food with it - you know, the tool itself is a tool. The intention of the party using the tool is a part of the process, right? You know: the knife cuts the steak, stabs the person, saves somebody from danger, cuts somebody out of a car.","My mom used to tell me stories at night, read books to me - and I read 'em over and over and over again. And you know what I learned from that? I went back and looked at everything - Why do I like reading the same stories over and over and over again? What, was I some kind of nincompoop? No - the narrative gave me connection with my mom."],"Peter Hain":["When you look at what I've done here, you see a consistent theme of reforms which is not driven by any dogma from across the water, but a radical agenda to make sure Northern Ireland's people enjoy equal opportunities, driven by the values of social justice.","There will be no support in the island of Ireland for building a nuclear power station.","We'll be launching the new public prosecution service in Northern Ireland tomorrow. I'll be doing it in Belfast tomorrow. This is an entirely new era, in which criminal justice now exercised on an equal basis, not the old basis in which community division was a feature.","What's crucial is that the IRA produce a credible statement that paramilitary and criminality activity is a thing of the past. That they are committed to a future which is exclusively peaceful and democratic.","I'm going to be looking forward, asked to be judged on my record, not taken back as has been the - in a sense, the tendency throughout politics in Northern Ireland, is to always look back, always look at what was said a long time ago, instead of looking forward.","The big missing part of the jig-saw is to get the assembly back up and running here in Northern Ireland, to get shared government back in business, that is my objective, and we await the IRA statement to see if this will trigger a new dawn.","A lot of leading countries in the world, including the United States and Russia, have to take their responsibilities much more seriously to ensure we are back on the road to peace and stability.","I strongly support European sanctions against Mugabe and his ruling clique. We must do all in our power to help the people of Zimbabwe achieve their freedom and prosperity once again.","I was never Vice Chair of the Troops Out Movement.","I've had very good meetings with Unionist leaders, Democratic Unionist Party, Ian Paisley and his team.","It's been fascinating watching all those pictures of me with a lot more hair Jeremy, and looking very young. And we've all got things we've said, twenty, thirty years ago, indeed the whole world has changed since then.","My job now, as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, is to take this process forward, and that I'm determined to do, whatever old clippings you dig out and whatever old quotes you put before me.","Taxpayers will not stand for - nor should they - the funding of poster sites, leaflets or advertising. What people will support is funding for political education, for training, for party organization.","That Sinn Fein, as I've already indicated, their leaders have already indicated that's what they want to achieve - once we get that credible statement, then we can get around the table and start to move forward, and I'm confident we can do so.","We now have a political process, we've had a period of parties that have been fighting each other quite literally with bombs and bullets, talking to each other, and having sat together in the assembly and sharing government with each other.","What my job is, is to get on with getting the process of democratic politics, back on the road, entrenching the peace settlement, and I ask you to judge me on my record.","You can get on with your job. I'm going to get on with mine. And mine is to deliver for the people of Northern Ireland, that's what they expect from me and I'm not going to be deflected by interesting academic or media speculation or attempts to take the whole debate back."],"Peter Hall":["Whoever becomes the head of the National Theater finds himself in a position like that of Nelson's Column - pigeons dump on you because you're there.","The youth of France do not want a new neo-liberal contract."],"Peter Hambleton":["The film business has so many twists and turns that it's a miracle any film gets made.","Dwarves are very much of the earth and feel connected to the earth; considering gravity, their weight is low, but they're not small.","When two kids came along, I couldn't see how I could support them. The way it played out, I was away from the theatre for five years. I was a postie for the first part and then worked as an advertising copywriter, but I somehow found my way back.","I'm a New Zealand actor, and I really want to be doing our stuff here, and our stuff includes plays from overseas. In terms of survival, maybe I should have taken a shot elsewhere at some point, but it gets back to the same theme - we should have our own people telling our own stories.","I love Scotland. Edinburgh is a beautiful city and has a wonderful tradition of supporting the arts.","Tolkien didn't just write 'The Hobbit,' he created a whole world.","With Will Shakespeare writing your government's propaganda, you can't go wrong, can you?","Apparently, Stephen Hunter does a fantastic barbecue lamb."],"Peter Hammill":["Actually I think Art lies in both directions - the broad strokes, big picture but on the other hand the minute examination of the apparently mundane. Seeing the whole world in a grain of sand, that kind of thing.","I continue to believe, contrary to the given wisdom, that it's more interesting to have an album - or, indeed, an individual song - which has variety rather than homogeneity.","The crucial question one comes back to is the examination; without that experience is meaningless. And I think it's true that society is becoming more and more passive, less and less fired up with enthusiasm, in many spheres.","The passage of time is a continuing thing. At 18, you're going to live forever, and you are definitely not at 52, so that is a recurring topic. I still think it's the main stuff.","I'm not sure that Jesuits ever produce faithful Catholics. Because they're too fierce. It is Sturm und Drang, and it is guilt - it is all that battlefield stuff.","More people seem to know the Van der Graaf Generator material than my solo work - thanks, I suppose, to their parents' lingering vinyl collections.","To be honest, I don't know really what I do on stage.","If you're going to have a heart attack, mine was the kind to have. I'm thankful that it hasn't affected my output or my capacity to perform. And it has given me a lot to think and write about.","Being used to scientific terminology and theory it was always natural for me to push this stuff into songs.","I had then and still retain an interest in science for its own sake and as a metaphor for our current lives.","It costs so much to promote something these days that almost always safety is the preferred option, reference back to things which have been successful in the past. Also, people are simply not given the time to develop and find themselves and their audience as we were.","Marc Almond has done a couple of covers, a few people in Europa have done them. I own all the publishing. It's never really been addressed, as I haven't had the time to go out and tout the songs.","Seriously, these days I tend to shut up in terms of external analysis and DO try to let things speak for themselves, while still trying to get some depth into them.","So I, for one, didn't feel alienated by what happened in 77.","I do flip between being chatty and argumentative - and being a psycho-loner werewolf.","My mother was from West Bromwich; my grandfather was Pakistani. I had an aunt who started trying to trace the family tree and stopped when she saw what turned up.","I had a vision of myself as a novelist because that was where I could be serious. I couldn't with music.","My dictum has always been: 'This show is happening just here, just tonight, with these people who are in this hall, and nobody knows what's going to happen until it's done.'","I suppose, in a way, one could say I may be less interested in my career than the audience is. Not to mean that I'm disinterested in my career, but I don't see it in terms of one stepping stone or, 'Now I'm going to go into my blue phase,' or what have you.","There's always a Van der Graaf audience that wants to hear the band's sound. And totally fair enough. Why not? It's a band. You like the band, you like the band."],"Peter Hargreaves":["Our aim is to help the clients help themselves, not to tell them what to think.","I love criticism. Equitable Life went down because management wouldn't brook criticism, but if you are in business, you have to hear what's going wrong.","My greatest pleasure is going out on a horrible, cold, wet January morning to pick the vegetables for our Sunday lunch, putting them in a muddy pile on the table, and then spending 45 minutes washing and preparing them. I like doing it because it's so different to what I do in the week. The same holds for cleaning the car or shining my shoes.","I have wanted to run my own business since my time at Clitheroe grammar school. I remember thinking if I could get a penny from everyone in Britain, I would earn £208,000 a year.","Income-producing unit trusts are brilliant because if you can accept capital values will be volatile for a while, your dividend income will always be higher than what you get in the bank.","Other men have created FTSE 100 companies. But I believe no man has done this in his lifetime without acquisition or borrowing. My one regret is handing over the reigns.","Range Rovers are the greenest cars on the road.","We need an honest politician in charge who doesn't care whether they are re-elected and is prepared to make the unpopular decisions.","People in retail banks are not smart. They have a business model that's quite difficult to not make money out of - but still they somehow manage it.","Quite often, people who build big businesses don't believe anyone else can run them, and you end up with an old rascal in their 70s and no one to take them on. I could name several - and I won't - who put themselves in that invidious position.","When I fly to European destinations, I always fly economy; I don't fly business class - there is no advantage apart from a few more inches of room.","Money in property is dead money. It doesn't help the country. It's funny how the U.K., Ireland and Spain are the most property-obsessed nations in Europe and yet are also the ones suffering the most.","People should buy a house to live in, not as an investment. Property has become such a national obsession - it was the primary subject at dinner parties and how many television shows were dedicated to the market. It's not good for the economy.","I knew my successor would be better than me for the next stage of the company's life. And it was a relief - I'd been doing it for 30 years. My only worry was what the hell I was going to do with my time.","I couldn't have predicted the business would be worth so much. I could see that we would have this sort of market share, but I didn't realise the numbers would be so large.","I think I've been a moderately good boss. I've made a lot of people extremely wealthy - I think we've created 30 millionaires.","The older you get and the wealthier you get, the more complicated life becomes. That's why I have as few material assets as possible. Every material thing you have is more hassle.","We are one of only two FTSE 100 companies which do not use offshore or other tax avoidance arrangements. In fact, we are probably one of the highest taxpaying companies in the index.","The Conservatives, along with Labour, I don't think understand what it is like to run a business.","There is an old adage that the quickest way to drop your tax take is to increase taxes. If capital gains tax is going to be 50 percent, my contingent capital gains tax is going to be 250 million pounds."],"Peter Heller":["I just love when the learning curve is steep. And I love being in nature, in the wild.","A lot of my nonfiction is very strong environmental stories - I was the first guy to write about the dolphin killings in Japan.","Species are going extinct because of habitat loss and warming. I feel deeply responsible and think about it every day.","Writing, to me, is like kayaking a river. You are paddling down, and you come to a walled-off canyon, and you make a sharp turn, and you don't know what's around the corner. It could be a waterfall, it could be a big pool. The narrative current carries you. You're surprised, and you're thrilled, and sometimes you're terrified.","The great thing about being young and dumb is that you don't know what you can't do.","New Zealand is weird. I mean, it does not seem of this earth, not to me. It really is like something made up.","I remember the cover of this one L'Amour book showed a guy on horseback, leading a pack horse across a creek in the snow. Something about that cover - all I wanted to do was drift the high lonesome on horseback.","Writing 'Dog Stars' was coming home. My spirit just sang. It's what I wanted to do my whole life.","When I got out of college, I had to make a living, and I started writing for magazines, and it felt like the perfect job.","I write a thousand words a day, and I always stop in the middle of a scene or thought, and it makes it easy to pick up on the next day.","I don't know if we will really have a doomsday for human beings, but if we did, to me, it wouldn't be an unjust outcome, given how many species we're taking with us every year.","Huntington Beach is like ground zero for surfers.","Surfing is a life path. You have to really commit... You have to let go and have faith that it's gonna work out when you take off.","I like the drinking-out-of-the-fire-hose approach - you're getting way more than you can handle.","All my journalism, all my books are first person, and it's all memoir. Even when I'm writing about the oil spill in the Gulf, it's all first person there.","I've always wanted to be a novelist, so I just try to write really great narrative.","I got out of Iowa all set to be a poet and a novelist, but you know what? It's really tough to make a living as a poet.","Kook means the clueless beginner who paddles his surf board out to the other surfers in the lineup and starts chattering away like it's a cocktail party, completely ignores all the finely-tuned protocols of surf that have developed over decades.","My dad was a copywriter on Madison Avenue at the same time as the TV show 'Mad Men' is set. My mom raised the kids and was a scholarship coordinator at a school. More importantly, dad was a writer and my mom an artist.","I have two younger sisters, and it was a family full of creativity.","I love to fish almost more than anything.","I always wanted to be a writer. I was writing poetry when I was 6.","My dad's wife, my stepmom, is a serious painter. My dad also paints. My mother is a brilliant sculptor, and her husband is a sculptor.","Loss is universal. I've lost grandparents that I dearly adored, lost animals that were like brothers to me. Many of us have gone through terrible breakups.","The one thing they didn't tell you at Iowa is how hard it is to make a living writing fiction and poetry.","I had to make a living, so I got happily diverted into writing about expeditions and adventures.","I write a lot of environmental stories.","Writing nonfiction, you're responsible to posterity, to history, to other people because the events happened, and you feel responsible to record them as they happened.","With fiction, I felt like I could bring to bear my full imagination, my entire heart, and so you feel very vulnerable. It's not your physical life, but it's everything else, so it felt like a lot was at stake.","There's always been in my life that tension between living and writing. For me, because I'm so physically exuberant, it was extra hard to sit still at the desk and put in the hours that you need to put in to write.","I'm fascinated by characters who are faced with big losses and have to put their lives back together again.","I wrote strong advocacy stories, and when I got to fiction, I made a deliberate effort to leave that behind and enter a country where I had no ax to grind, no advocacy issues that I was carrying with me.","The great thing about fiction is that everything you care about ends up going into the book.","Wanted to write fiction since I was 11, since I first read 'In Our Time' by Hemingway.","Yes, I love poetry, both to read and to write it. A first love."],"Peter Hermann":["Some days, I just love the physical space of the theater. I love theaters; they are heartbreakingly beautiful to me.","I was born in New York, but I was only here for two months. My parents are German, and I grew up in Germany for my first 10 years.","Language patterns solidify at 10, 11, 12, so I was able to learn English fairly easily, with no accent. I didn't do speech or vocal work to get rid of the German accent; I was just lucky.","I still speak to my parents only in German, and I have endless family over there."],"Peter Higgs":["I'm a fan of supersymmetry, largely because it seems to be the only route by which gravity can be brought into the scheme. It's probably not even enough, but it's a way forward to get gravity involved. If you have supersymmetry, then there are more of these particles. That would be my favourite outcome.","Nobody else took what I was doing seriously, so nobody would want to work with me. I was thought to be a bit eccentric and maybe cranky.","I'm a great admirer of 'The Simpsons.' It's very surprising because it's backed by a right-wing television company in the U.S., and quite often it's poking fun at the people who would be its audience.","I was an embarrassment to the department when they did research assessment exercises. A message would go round the department: 'Please give a list of your recent publications.' And I would send back a statement: 'None.'","My recollection of the higher school certificate, which involved a practical exam in physics, was being confronted with an experiment involving a sort of barometer arrangement, wondering why I couldn't make it work.","My inbox and doormat are full with emails and letters from people who want me to endorse their Higgs board game or to inaugurate the walkway of their new office atrium. There's even a microbrewery in Barcelona which wants to know what my favourite beer is so they can brew a similar one in my honour. It is quite mad.","The model I came up with in 1964 is just the invention of a rather strange sort of medium that looks the same in all directions and produces a kind of refraction that is a little bit more complicated than that of light in glass or water.","When the basic status of a theory is clear, and all that needs to be cleared are details, you can collaborate. But if the main structure of a hypothesis isn't established, and you want to change the paradigm - like it was the case in the 1960s - it's better to work alone.","It's nice to be right sometimes.","After I retired, it was quite a long time before I went back to my department. I thought I was well out of it.","I'm rather cynical about the way the honours system is used, frankly. A whole lot of the honours system is used for political purposes by the government in power.","If the U.K. were threatening to withdraw from Europe, I would certainly want Scotland to be out of that.","When my wife and I got married, she thought of me being an easygoing person, and I warned her I wasn't.","I don't regard television as the outside world. I regard it as an artefact.","I liked Edinburgh as a university in a way that I'd never enjoyed King's College London. I realised after I came to Edinburgh that perhaps it was a mistake to have gone to a college which was bang in the centre of a vast city. It had a bad effect on the social life of the students because a lot of them were commuting from outer London.","I was already, I think, at the age of 18, showing signs of being incompetent in the lab.","It shouldn't be a Higgs field. If it's anybody's, it should be Goldstone field, I think. When Nambu wrote his short paper in 1960, Jeffrey Goldstone of Cambridge University, who was visiting Cern, heard about it. He then wrote a paper which was conceptually similar to what Nambu had done, but a simpler model.","I can only speak for particle physics. But it has become obvious that on the experimental side, there has been a huge evolution in the number of people who have to collaborate because of the gigantic size of the instruments used, but also because of the enormous task that is data analysis.","In 2002, a Scottish journalist, during a dinner meant to be private, absolutely wanted me to react to Stephen Hawking's comments. I said one shouldn't pay too much attention to what Hawking was saying because he was a celebrity but not a specialist of elementary particle theory.","The first interview I gave to the press was in 1987 when some people thought a previous machine at Cern, called LEP, might have enough energy to produce the particle.","The Nobel Prize has been a disturbance at the beginning of October for some years. It would be gratifying to win, but it would be quite an ordeal, too, with all the events which go on for two days. I'd think carefully about what I was doing the day it is announced and maybe not be around, or be around, but elsewhere.","Edinburgh is my adopted home. It's a place where I wanted to come and live, and I managed to arrange my life so it happened.","One of the first things I did on arriving at school was to break my left arm falling into a bomb crater.","The point came when people were doing things I didn't feel competent to do myself. I'm not being modest; I honestly get lost. I was lucky in spotting what I did when I did, but there comes a point where you realise what you're doing is not going to be much good."],"Peter Hobson":["It's a journey, it's a fight everyday. There was a real effort to stay in the program... So far this has been a very successful rehab.","One of the things that's often forgotten about drug rehabilitation, it's not a destiny. It's a journey."],"Peter Hollingworth":["Some people are a natural administrator. They actually enjoy doing it. I find it a chore. I'm not a details person. I go for the big sweep.","I just think in this world of extreme religious pluralism, the great spectrum of things ranging from the healthy and the respectable, and the balance and the true and tried, you go down to quite bizarre things which are very risky for people, particularly people who are young or vulnerable or unable to discriminate.","I enjoy ritual and ceremony. What I don't like is when it's badly done or sloppily done. This is actually a theological issue - the forms we adopt, the actions we take, the way we do things, are, as it were, a sacrament.","I think the truth is, we are all racist, really, when it comes down to it. I think all of us have to check ourselves from time to time, and say, 'Look, that sort of attitude isn't good enough.' It takes discipline to keep our prejudices out.","All human kingship risks a denial of the sovereignty of God.","I can cite a few cases of where people have tampered around with magic and witchcraft that they've been very severely frightened and traumatised by some of the outcomes. I mean we are playing with fire, and I had to say that.","I'm not over-reacting, but I do think people have to be a bit cautious when they say all kind of activities associated with witchcraft are harmless.","I'd have to say, and I think that most Christians would hold the view, that there is such a thing as evil, and there are evil forces at work. You can articulate that by talking about Satan or the Devil; that's sound, Scriptural teaching.","I didn't do very well at school, and I suppose I've always had this sense, you know that, of being average, so I've been a bit low on self-confidence in my ability.","Over the years I've tried to be clear about the things that are important in life, the things that matter, and I've tried to pursue them, and, I've had a certain sense of 'stickability,' hanging in there, and I suppose that's me.","I was no great achiever at school, either academically or in the sporting field... I was always tending to be in trouble.","There are no training courses to make people bishops. You have to learn on the job."],"Peter Hook":["When you DJ, you're just on your own, which is nice because there's no argument.","People go and hide, but I don't. I'm a fighter.","What I've learned is that life is a balance between idealism and realism.","A poetic, sensitive, tortured soul, the Ian Curtis of the myth - he was definitely that.","Sarcasm is a Manchester trait.","I think people expect mud at festivals, I think you'd be asking for your money back if you didn't get it.","There are seven songs finished and on par with any that are on Siren's.","Nobody is the same. If we were all the same it would be bloody boring.","The break-up of a relationship is always difficult, especially a 30-year one.","'Movement' sounded like Joy Division, but 'Power, Corruption & Lies' is the first New Order record.","Once you made that decision to split New Order up, you were like, 'Woo-hoo! I better get out there and get a job.'","I love that young bands will do anything to succeed.","New Order never celebrated anything to do with Joy Division.","I was reading an article about Kings of Leon's bass player, who said that he was directly influenced by Joy Division and by me. I was like, 'Woah!' It surprised me. It's a great compliment.","There are keyboard terrorists everywhere who hide behind a veil of anonymity to pursue their vicious slanders.","I don't pretend to be Joy Division or New Order. What I do is very straight forward: it's an interpretation and a celebration of the music, with different people. Everyone looks at it and knows exactly what I'm doing.","That's it really, at the moment I wouldn't say I was influenced by any one thing in particular.","And they do tend to be fast and up, because that's how I like to drive.","But then I quite enjoy when something goes wrong, because when I watch DJs that take it very seriously, it's nice when you make a mistake and laugh about it.","It's quite ironic I suppose, it's that thing about being in a group when you all start out as friends and then invariably end up hating each other. So I just thought they needed telling really, in case they were labouring under the apprehension that they were still friends.","I'd rather have ten people who are mad for it than ten thousand who aren't.","Actually when we stopped New Order I was busier than ever. The only gaps have been while we've been writing.","The fact is that you don't want to be away forever, but you want to lead a normal life.","Yeah, I still feel as if I have things to do really. I'm not ready to stop.","When you balance it against New Order, New Order don't work or tour relentlessly. We definitely work in our own way and sometimes it's a bit too slow for me, so I like to plan ahead and fill my time up.","It's the same misconception I used to have. I meet people and think they're millionaires and they're not.","I think that you have to bear in mind that music is about escape, and it's not unreasonable to think the music business would be based around escapism.","Democracy for us tends to be has to do with who shouts the loudest!","We need to talk about what we are going to do and see and decide. We'll have to wait and see.","The chemistry involved made everything Factory did quite special.","The scary thing is when I did my set in Texas everyone was excited. The show was great. I was done and the next DJ put something on vinyl and the difference! The quality!!","America stopped making vinyl and phased out the single but Germany held out and refused. Warner's never phased out vinyl in Germany. Now America imports it!","They amaze me most of those remixes. Some of them are crap. But every time I complain, someone comes up and says they are for a different market that you don't understand. Some of the New Order ones are really great, though.","We've had a problem finding a vocalist. We have not been lucky yet to find the one. I think the problem is that the three of us have such a pedigree of vocalist, that if we come out with someone that's not good we'll obviously be slated!","We don't to be some kind of rock supergroup for the sake of being a supergroup. You want to change things and say something fresh and new so you appeal to people as a new group.","To me, New Order split up when Bernard and I stopped writing together. We started Joy Division together; we started New Order together.","Old men are cantankerous: they like to get their own way.","I prefer it when I can intimidate the audience rather than the audience intimidate me. I've been lucky in my career to have both.","My mother used to always say to me, 'Do naught, get naught.' It's an adage that I hold by. If you don't do anything, you can't really expect anything.","'24 Hour Party People' was a comedy, and I knew that from the beginning.","Bands don't play the whole LP. They play a selection of the songs that they like.","I read one too many books about Joy Division by people who weren't there, and they always seem to dwell on the dark, the intense, the miserable image of Joy Division.","Music was such an important part of everyone's life in the '60s and '70s, but everywhere you played, the music was dreadful.","'Love Will Tear Us Apart' is very simply written.","The thing with Joy Division's music is that each member was playing like a separate line. We hardly ever played together; we all played separately. But when you put it together, it was like the ingredients in a cake.","To be in one band that changed the world musically is pretty good, but to be in two bands that changed the world musically, that's amazing.","I look back on Joy Division very fondly indeed. I know that, of course, the band came to a tragic end, but that does not change the fact that Joy Division was a great band to be a part of.","I am man enough to be able to admit my own mistakes. I think that is an important trait to have.","It's really nice to be able to do what I'm doing without having to compromise with another musician.","The reason Joy Division and New Order are as influential and successful as they are is because of the unique playing of all the individuals.","Knowing very little about a band only adds to the allure.","You look at 30 Seconds to Mars, and you don't think, 'Ooh, I bet they're angry.' No one really does anger these days. I suppose it's a turn-off.","I've never been out of work in my whole life.","The rise of the iPod meant that digital music became the norm, It's sad, but you can still find the real stuff out there if you look for it!","I have a hard time getting my head around the idea of playing 'The Perfect Kiss' in my 50s. I can't quite get there.","I'm not a good flyer. Because I do it so much, I think the odds of something going wrong are not in my favour.","When you've travelled for 34 years as a musician, you do all the culture stuff when you're young and full of energy. In the middle stage, you indulge too much and are scared of daylight. Then, in the final stage, you've seen it all, so you tend to take things a lot easier.","At my age, I only travel business class because I just don't bend anymore; my body can't cope with it.","I've stayed in hotels where you were scared to even put your feet on the floor, or had to sleep in a chair.","I just like keeping busy and having ten things on the go.","I must confess that over my career, I've actually downplayed the importance of DJs. It's such a different art form. Then all of a sudden you try it, and you think, 'Good God, these guys do work.' I used to be very cynical and very blase about it. I can only apologize.","I play a lot of hard, uncompromising dance music; it can be anything from dance to rock to reggae.","Originally, I didn't play any New Order when I deejayed. I suppose it comes from being a little embarrassed or humble or whatever. But people were coming to see me because of New Order, so in the end, I had to realize that if they were using my name on the poster, then maybe I should play some of the music.","Dance music tends to be a solitary affair.","You don't get many chances in the world, and you don't want to throw them away.","It was nice doing my own Joy Division book to be able to put forward the fact that Ian was actually quite a nice guy and very hardworking, ambitious and loyal. But the thing was, he was battling such a dreadful illness in an era when they really didn't know how to treat it.","Most people have just heard Joy Division on record. And Joy Division on record was completely different than it was live.","I've been very grateful and humbled by the fact that young people really dig Joy Division's music. It's a great testament to the chemistry and the songwriting prowess between the four original members.","'Unknown Pleasures' is a very important record for me. It was the first LP that I recorded.","What was punk all about? To me, it was if you really want to do something, go ahead and do it.","One of the great things about education is that it should stop you making mistakes - and I have made a lot of mistakes.","Bass players are always the underdogs of the band, but I made sure that I was never viewed as one. I went out of my way to steal as much limelight as I could.","The worst words I could ever hear as a bass player was, 'Can you play the root notes?'","When I'm not playing music, certainly the last thing I want to do is listen to music!","I've watched so-called 'New Order' playing in Auckland, and Tom Chapman is miming along to my bass on tape... He's got his fingers on the low, and you can hear my high bass in the background. So he's miming.","Over the years, Joy Division has become a huge part of music culture.","Accept what you did do, and live with it.","I regularly go to concerts with my children sharing the music.","You can't buy class.","Madonna's like a black widow spider. She tends to use people, then they shrivel up and disappear.","The interesting thing is that New Order finished on an okay note. It was only after we split that things got worse.","There are so many bootlegged Joy Division/Martin Hannett tapes, a lot of really bad bootlegs on the Internet.","There are lots of Joy Division songs that are so powerful when played live, some of which we did either never play or played very rarely.","I am always working on new material with my production partner Phil Murphy in our guise as Man Ray; we do a lot of soundtrack work & some great collaborations.","In the late '70s, the conditions that bands had to endure were, shall we say, not as civilized as they are today. People were a lot more aggressive back then. So there was definitely a lot of suffering for your art. But I would argue that was a good thing. Generally, people make better music when they suffer.","When you're fat and comfortable, your music is going to sound fat and comfortable.","For the first 18 months of Joy Division, we used our jobs to fund the band. We'd all chip in three, five quid to go and do a gig. But it was worth it. It was amazing we could afford to feed ourselves. But we were so creatively and artistically satisfied. You can't explain that to somebody who's never been there.","Bootleggers quake in fear of me ringing them on a Sunday afternoon. I call after dinner, usually.","My big frustration in New Order was that they played the same tracks all the time.","There are so little outtakes from the Joy Division era. We didn't have much money. You couldn't be very generous in recording, so we were very thrifty in how we recorded. Everything was very, very well looked after financially because we just couldn't afford it.","When I play a gig and look out at the audience, you're literally looking at a sea of Joy Division T-shirts.","We loved country songs in New Order. That's our big secret!","I don't find imitating other people's music easy at all. I remember being fifth in line for a Rolling Stones tour, early '90s, when Bill Wyman left, and I was hoping against hope that I wouldn't get the call to audition. I wouldn't be able to play a Stones song if you put a gun to my head.","When I started DJing years ago, I took great delight in annoying the audience. Playing Johnny Cash in the middle of a banging night.","I'm one of those old cynics that thinks, whoever you vote for, the government always gets in.","My father was always Labour, and my mother was always Conservative, so I tended to sort of go in the middle.","I always do try to encourage my children to vote and at least exercise their right.","Any coalition, especially where one party is more powerful than the other, it's always bound to have a pecking order.","Great music seems to come from a lot of angst, and that angst is from great musicians getting together with intense chemistry. When that chemistry isn't there, people tend not to write great music.","When you get the right people together, writing music becomes very effortless."],"Peter Horton":["Every director I've ever admired has a beard.","Melodrama is something that is created... I don't seen a melodramatic episode of '90210' or any show that relies on that and think, 'Oh, that's life. That's how I experience it.'","I consider myself a reasonable man. As such, I tend to expect others to behave with a modicum of reason and common sense. Especially those with power.","I just think age is meaningless. It's a system we've all agreed to that supposedly signals when we should develop, reach our peak and go downhill, as they say. It interferes with our natural growth."],"Peter Jackson":["The most honest form of filmmaking is to make a film for yourself.","One of the best things about growing up in New Zealand is that if you are prepared to work hard and have faith in yourself, truly anything is possible.","New Zealand is not a small country but a large village.","Over 55% of all shots using animals in 'The Hobbit' are in fact computer generated; this includes horses, ponies, rabbits, hedgehogs, birds, deer, elk, mice, wild boars and wolves.","100 years ago, movies were black-and-white, silent, and 16 frames a second. So 100 years from now, what are they going to be?","Filmmaking for me is always aiming for the imaginary movie and never achieving it.","We have lost close friends and relatives to cancer and Parkinson's disease, and the level of personal suffering inflicted on patients and their families by these diseases is horrific.","I first read 'The Lord of the Rings' as an adolescent. It's a dense novel, a sprawling, complex monster of a book populated with a prolific number of characters caught up in a narrative structure that, frankly, does not lend itself to conventional storytelling.","In every house, when the curtains are drawn, there's a story going on, and you never get to hear... You get the public side of things, the happy, smiling, social activities.","Where film is infinitely superior to any other medium is emotion and story and character.","Prosthetic makeup is always frustrating.","The Tolkien estate owns the writings of Professor Tolkien. 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Rings' were sold by Professor Tolkien in the late '60s, the film rights.","Once upon a time, sound was new technology.","I think everything that you do, you're learning. I mean, every movie that you make is like a film school; that's one of the things that I enjoy about filmmaking.","As a filmmaker, you want nothing more than to have people say, 'I love your movie.'","I've always been happy to take a gamble on myself.","The big-budget blockbuster is becoming one of the most dependable forms of filmmaking.","Adapting a novel is not really about being faithful to every word and every moment the author has created. It's more about that same story being filtered through somebody else's sensibility.","To get an Oscar would be an incredible moment in my career, there is no doubt about that. But the 'Lord of the Rings' films are not made for Oscars, they are made for the audience.","I feel very lucky to be able to make movies in New Zealand, and I will always be grateful for the support I have received from so many New Zealanders.","There are perennial stories like 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'Sherlock Holmes' and those sorts of things, which have been around since almost as long as film, and 'Frankenstein' is another one. They're perennial favorites, which get remade every 20 years, and that's OK.","I like to keep an open mind, but I do think there is some form of energy that exists separate to our flesh and blood. I do think that there's some kind of an energy that leaves the body when it dies, but I certainly don't have religious beliefs particularly.","What I don't like are pompous, pretentious movies.","Everybody's life has these moments, where one thing leads to another. Some are big and obvious and some are small and seemingly insignificant.","There's a very go-to kind of attitude in New Zealand that stems from that psyche of being quite isolated and not being able to rely on the rest of the world's infrastructure.","I think 'Jaws' is a remarkable film.","Once you go down a road, you take it through to the end.","If you make a trilogy, the whole point is to get to that third chapter, and the third chapter is what justifies what's come before.","I'm always embarrassed by those rugby player autobiographies which get written by journalists.","Obviously, with a CGI character, you're building a character in much the same way as a real creature is built. You build the bones, the skeletons, the muscles. You put layers of fat on. You put a layer of skin on which has to have a translucency, depending on what the character is.","If you're a filmmaker, and every time you finish a film, you just naturally go, 'Oh, I could have done so much better,' that's not much fun, is it, really? You might as well go pick another profession if that really is how you derive satisfaction from it.","The cameo I did in 'Fellowship of the Ring' was I was in the street of Bree, and I was eating a carrot.","It's not going to be too much longer before Xbox Live produces programming.","I'm thinking about doing a First World War film.","Film is such a powerful medium. It's like a weapon and I think you have a duty to self-censor.","I think that George Lucas' 'Star Wars' films are fantastic. What he's done, which I admire, is he has taken all the money and profit from those films and poured it into developing digital sound and surround sound, which we are using today.","No film has captivated my imagination more than 'King Kong.' I'm making movies today because I saw this film when I was 9 years old.","I didn't want my kids having to pass through an airport named after their father.","I mean, I didn't have a huge upbringing with movies, I guess.","For a lot of my childhood, I didn't want to direct movies because I didn't really know what directing was.","Rivalry doesn't help anybody.","One of the first movies I ever saw was 'Batman,' based on the TV series with Adam West and Burt Ward.","The vast majority of the CGI budget is labor.","The only thing about 3-D is the dullness of the image.","Actors will never be replaced. The thought that somehow a computer version of a character is going to be something people prefer to look at is a ludicrous idea.","I was bullied and regarded as little bit of an oddball myself.","I used to send away for eight-minute Super 8 movies of various Ray Harryhausen scenes advertised on the back of 'Famous Monsters of Filmland' magazine.","There was a great magazine in the '80s called 'Cinemagic' for home moviemakers who liked to do monster and special effects movies. It was like a magazine written just for me.","When you're starting out, you know, you have to do something on a very limited budget. You're not going to be able to have great actors, and you're most likely not going to have a great script.","I've always tried to make movies that pull the audience out of their seats... I want audiences to be transported.","48 frames per second is something you have to get used to. I've got absolute belief and faith in 48 frames... it's something that could have ramifications for the entire industry. 'The Hobbit' really is the test of that.","I thought that there might be something unsatisfying about directing two Tolkien movies after 'Lord of the Rings.' I'd be trying to compete with myself and deliberately doing things differently.","Buster Keaton's 'The General,' from 1927, I think is still one of the great films of all time.","I watch 'Goodfellas,' and suddenly it frees me up entirely; it reminds me of what great film directing is all about.","People sort of accuse Tolkien of not being good with female characters, and I think that Eowyn actually proves that to be wrong to some degree. Eowyn is actually a strong female character, and she's a surprisingly modern character, considering who Tolkien actually was sort of a stuffy English professor in the 1930s and '40s.","In the old days, you cut out a scene that might've been a really great scene, and no one was ever going to see it ever again. Now, with DVD, you can obviously... there's a lot of possibilities for scenes that are good scenes.","Every time you do something, people are going to like it, people are going to hate it. You tend to make the movies on the basis you are making them for the people who are going to like them and not worrying too much about people who don't like them.","I am not anti-media at all. But the media, the news anywhere in the world, is based on drama.","It is now such a complex society in terms of media. It just comes at us from every direction. You kind of have to push it all away.","Second movies are great because you can drop into them, and it doesn't really have a beginning on it, particularly in a traditional way. You can just tear into it.","As a filmmaker, I believe in trying to make movies that invite the audience to be part of the film; in other words, there are some films where I'm just a spectator and am simply observing from the front seat. What I try to do is draw the audience into the film and have them participate in what's happening onscreen.","Filmmakers have to commit to making 3-D films properly like Jim Cameron did and not do cheap conversions at the tail end of the process.","You don't want to believe everything you read on the Internet.","I fell in love with stories watching a British television puppet show called 'Thunderbirds' when it first came out on TV, about 1965, so I would have been 4 or 5 years old. I went out into the garden at my mom and dad's house, and I used to play with my little dinky toys, little cars and trucks and things.","When I was about 14, I got a splicing kit, which means you could chop up the film into little pieces and switch the order around and glue it together.","Learning how to edit movies was a real breakthrough.","Strategically, horror films are a good way to start your career. You can get a lot of impact with very little.","Obviously, movies, you're often on location, out in the rain or the sun, in a real place where the trees and the cars are real. But when you're on stage, as an actor you're imagining the environment that you're in.","If you take a regular animated film, that's being done by animators on computers, so the filmmaking is a fairly technical process.","To direct a genuinely animated film, you're really having meetings and discussing what you want with animators who then go off and produce one shot at a time that you look at and comment on.","I never overtly analyse my own movies, I don't think that's my job to do that. I just muddle through and do what I think is best for the movie.","'The Return Of The King' has a conclusion.","I love Bilbo Baggins. I relate really well to Bilbo!","I never wanted to do 'The Hobbit' in the first place.","I just think that we're living in a world where the technology is advancing so rapidly. You're having cameras that are capable of more and more - the resolution on cameras is jumping up.","We had to get past the mechanical film age to be able to explore other things, but it will be interesting.","Critics in particular treat CGI as a virus that's infecting film.","I remember when I was - I must've been 17 or 18 years old - I remember 'The Empire Strikes Back' had a big cliffhanger ending, and it was, like, three years before the next one came out.","If you're an only child, you spend a lot of time by yourself, and you develop a strong ability to entertain yourself, to conjure up fantasy.","Too often, you see film makers from other countries who have made interesting, original films, and then they come here and get homogenized into being hack Hollywood directors. I don't want to fall into that.","I have a freedom that's incredibly valuable. Obviously my freedom is far smaller in scale than people like Zemeckis and Spielberg have here. But it's comparable. I can dream up a project, develop it, make it, control it, release it.","I always have had a slightly jaundiced view about people who promote books about themselves.","What I think is remarkable about my mum and dad is they had no interest in films, really. None.","It's one thing to support your kid, but if you have an interest in what your child is doing, it makes it a whole lot easier.","There's a generation of children who don't like black and white movies. There's a level of impatience or intolerance now.","Stem cell therapy has the potential to treat a multitude of diseases and illnesses, which up until now have been labelled 'incurable.'","Continuing advances in stem cell medicine will change all of our lives for the better.","I haven't got a real job.","The producers of 'The Hobbit' take the welfare of all animals very seriously and have always pursued the highest standard of care for animals in their charge.","Once the film is out and a lot of people are seeing it, it becomes almost owned by the cinemagoers of the world.","The first day I start shooting, I start having a recurring nightmare that every single night that I am lying in bed, and there is a film crew surrounding the bed, waiting for me to tell them what to do, and I don't quite know what movie I am supposed to be making.","Anything you can imagine, you can put on film.","The industry has to have the audience in order to make these films. So it's a serious thing - how do you get people to leave their houses and go to the theater?","I think it's important that filmmakers look at the technology and figure out how to make the theatrical experience a little more exciting.","I'm not going to head off and do a Marvel film. So if I don't do a Marvel film, I don't have any other choice - I've got to go make a small New Zealand movie!","I can't take responsibility for everyone's employment.","We are living in an age where teenagers are not going to the movies.","I didn't want people to sit there and watch 10 minutes of film,and all they write about is 48 frames.","For me, utter failure is to make a film that people pay their money to go see and they don't like.","We've all forgotten how to be original.","It's not a happy time when a film drops dead on your doorstep.","Forty-eight frames per second is a way, way better way to look at 3D. It's so much more comfortable on the eyes.","I'm not a regret guy.","You can't always look at life as a miserable thing.","If you take 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Rings' as books, one is written for children, and one is an adult's book.","When you look at the original 'Paradise Lost' film, you see three kids who can't defend themselves, being persecuted in a medieval way - witchcraft, satanic worship. It was kind of primitive.","My dad always told me that the principal reason he chose New Zealand to emigrate to after World War II was the high regard his father had for the Kiwis he encountered at Gallipoli.","I have a million questions about my granddad and no one to talk to.","The theatrical versions are the definitive versions. I regard the extended cuts as being a novelty for the fans that really want to see the extra material.","I don't have an anti-Hollywood feeling. It's just I'm a New Zealander. I was born in New Zealand, and it's where my house is, and my family goes to school there. My interest is to remain in my homeland and make films. I don't really want to relocate myself to other countries in the world to work.","'Temeraire' is a terrific meld of two genres that I particularly love - fantasy and historical epic.","In the case of 'The Lovely Bones,' I felt that it was subject matter not often dealt with in film, and with a tone that is also rare.","People regard CGI as a gimmick; they almost blame CGI for a bad story or a bad script. They talk about CGI as if it's responsible for a drop in standards.","I think we're going to enter a phase where there's less interest in the CGI and there's a demand for story again. I think we've dropped the ball a little bit on stories for the sake of the amazing toys that we've played with.","I don't quite know what an auteur is.","I hope one day that I'll get to make another horror film; I'd love to.","Being honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame alongside the names of some of my childhood heroes is slightly surreal and incredibly awesome.","I don't really want to make a stylized film or anything too surreal.","There is a lot of 'Halo' movie material no one has ever seen in New Zealand.","Pre-preproduction is the tenuous time before a project is greenlit; before the studio commits to spending real money. This is the most vulnerable period for any film because it's the time when your project is most likely to be put into turnaround. That's film-speak for killed off.","'The Lord of the Rings,' published in the mid-1950s, was intended as a prehistory to our own world. It was perceived by Tolkien to be a small but significant episode in a vast alternate mythology constructed entirely out of his own imagination.","When I worked as a newspaper photo engraver in the only job I ever had, many years ago, I'd get the train home to Pukerua Bay where I was staying with my parents. An hour ride, 16 stops, and almost always, I'd have automatic wake-up, seconds before we pulled into my station.","I want to put everything I think I've learned about filmmaking and storytelling and put it to the test in other areas.","The Beatles once approached Stanley Kubrick to do 'The Lord Of The Rings.' This was before Tolkien sold the rights. They approached him, and he said, 'No.'","It's almost like an optical illusion, 'The Hobbit.' You look at the book, and it is really thin, and you could make a relatively thin film as well. What I mean by that is that you could race through the story at the speed that Tolkien does.","I love writing, and I love postproduction. That's great, because you start to reassemble the film, and you sit there, and you start to really put the film together, finally. The shooting of it is the most stressful part of the process.","We're human beings, and we want stories. We're always going to be entertained and have our emotions touched by humanity and by things that we recognize in our own lives. So whilst every now and again we'll be happy to watch a bubblegum film, it's never gonna be the only things that get made.","If justice is supposed to be fair, than any justice system you would hope is based on fairness.","While you're finding evidence of innocence, you also find evidence that points to other people.","You never make movies for Oscars.","I never dreamed in a million years that 'The Lord of the Rings' would be nominated for an Oscar. Those types of fantasy movies never got nominations.","I make cameos in all my movies for no particular reason other than a joke. It's just a Hitchcock thing.","I just got tired of being overweight and unfit, so I changed my diet from hamburgers to yogurt and muesli, and it seems to work.","To some degree, I was very dubious of the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' idea - taking a theme park ride and turning into a film - even though they seemed to end up being quite fun films.","To be an original is probably the hardest quality to find if you're a young filmmaker.","I don't think that because you die and move on to somewhere else that you lose your sense of humor.","There are a couple of locations in 'The Hobbit' that are shared with 'Lord of the Rings.'","The idea of an animated film is you always kind of get a little bit daunted by it as a filmmaker because it feels like a lot of your communication is going to be with computer artists, and you're going to have to kind of channel the movie through extra pairs of hands.","'Bad Taste' was - it was, in many respects, my sort of, my, I guess, my single-minded desire to want to break into the film industry when New Zealand didn't really have a film industry to break into.","'Heavenly Creatures' was really the idea of Fran Walsh. It was a very famous New Zealand murder case, but not one that people knew much about.","I don't like directing that much to want a career as a director for hire. I like to have as much creative control as possible.","The entertainment options for young people are a lot broader now, and the quality of films is slumping a little bit.","If I'm lucky enough to be involved in the Academy Awards in the future, I'll just let people make up their decision without being involved in any politics. Because it shouldn't involve that.","I love collaborating with people."],"Peter James":["There are people who can achieve huge success in life, while adding a bit of fun and a splash of colour to this increasingly grey world.","I get asked to read new works a lot, in the hope that I will give a quotation and I will only give a 'puff' for a book I truly love.","Almost every officer is going to put their life on the line at some point in their career.","I think the police are a major part of the glue that holds civilised life together. They're not highly paid.","The police feel that most of the public are against them and that there is a lot of bad feeling.","My day starts with Radio 4's Today live or 'listen again' wherever I am in the world, thanks to digital radio - I even have an app on my iPhone that receives it.","I travel abroad constantly on book promotion and research, and the Internet is invaluable to me for accessing U.K. news in places such as America, which most of the time hasn't heard of England.","Music is an important part of my writing process.","There's a really classic cliche every time you switch the TV on - you see cops arguing. I have spent a day a week for many years in the presence of police and I have never seen them argue. It's a military hierarchy. They do what they're told. There's no bickering."],"Peter Jason":["It's funny, but on a set there's a pecking order. There's a caste system, you know? It goes from the star down to the extra. That includes the crew as well. I've never liked that.","I've always felt that, in America, we're all equal. I don't care what you make or what kind of car you drive. You're not better than me.","I think everybody's the same. I think we're all entitled to our space, and I like to treat everybody like that."],"Peter Jennings":["Always have a sense of humor about life - you'll need it - but always be courteous to boot.","I think I came to see Islam, or at least one part of Islam, as an important defense mechanism against the commercialization of the world.","I think sometimes negative campaigning, like so much, is in the eye of the beholder, and I don't think we'll ever get rid of it.","The candidate out front on Labor Day has historically been the one who stayed ahead in November.","I was raised with the notion that it was OK to ask questions, and it was OK to say, I'm not sure. I believe, but I'm not quite so certain about the resurrection.","I am utterly struck how, 300 years after his execution, Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire.","We have been through a period where we see power leaching away from Washington. Who is more important in the world today: Bill Clinton or Bill Gates? I don't know.","It is essential for politicians to make a connection with us, as Franklin Roosevelt did, as Teddy Roosevelt did, as John F. Kennedy did, as Ronald Reagan did.","I don't think anybody who looks carefully at us thinks that we are a left-wing or a right-wing organization.","I'm a little concerned about this notion everybody wants us to be objective.","I'm not a slave to objectivity. I'm never quite sure what it means. And it means different things to different people.","If you tailor your news viewing so that you only get one point of view, well of course you're going to think somebody else has got a different point of view, and it may be wrong.","Some people continue to pretend that anchor people are reporters.","A couple of weeks is a long time in American politics.","Al Gore has dedicated his life to detail. George W. Bush has not. He's the first to admit it.","As a journalist, one tends to think there's nothing off limits.","Do I think I was put here on earth to be a journalist and to seek truth? No, I don't.","Do we elect a man because of what he stands for, because of where he stands on the issues, because how he makes the nation feel?","Don't be confused that my interest in religion, faith, and spirituality is driven by any sense of faith or spirituality of my own.","Every candidate goes into every debate hoping that they can own a particular moment.","George W. had a plan. He arranged to join the Air National Guard in Texas, which meant he would not be sent to Vietnam.","I am sensitive to the value of faith and religion and spirituality in people's lives because I'm a journalist.","I don't think a reporter should give advice or make predictions.","I have gone through a period of seeking to understand what or how strong or what are the connections I have to God.","I think Chris Matthews is a very bright guy. I'd listen to him even if he didn't shout at people.","I think I am very mainstream - I'm committed to good works in my life.","I think it's impossible for any of us not to find television, and the political process at its best on television, compelling.","I think you can be cynical about religion on occasion, and certainly skeptical about the degree to which some people use religion to manipulate other people.","I'm a big fan of CNN. I watched it from the beginning.","I'm a reporter. I'm not a scholar.","I'm an immigrant and I've always wanted to write something about America.","I've always shied away from conventional wisdom, though I know the power of it.","Scholars will argue with each other about everything.","Senator Albert Gore Sr. was one of the first outspoken critics of the Vietnam War.","The one thing that I have done really well in my life is be a father.","There's no such thing as an independent person.","Whatever you may think of Mrs. Clinton as a character, I think she believes quite strongly in public service."],"Peter Jurasik":["Like I said on my bio on my webpage, I was born at an early age, I was close to my mother.","I was born in New York.","I was born in Queens, New York, which is a suburb of New York City.","My childhood is completely... when I look back, it was '50s in New York, upper-middle class, it was completely idyllic and golden and wonderful - sweet in every way.","We were just a gaggle of kids, and everybody played together and had a good time. You know how kids can be completely horrible - abusive but fun. But anyway, it was a nice childhood.","I studied with the idea of becoming a Catholic priest.","That was my aspiration, so I was there in a seminary with just boys who were studying to be priests. Pretty rigorous schooling; we never got home, we stayed there all year.","So when I was 13, I basically left home and never returned and lived at home again. I would come home for a week at Christmas and two weeks in the summer only.","I left because I decided it just really wasn't for me, and I got a better understanding of what the Catholic Church needed from its priests and ministers.","I was unwilling to - without getting too philosophical about it - I was unwilling to structure my spirituality in the way that the church wanted me to structure it.","I have a much wider, freer view about spirituality. I feel that people need to pursue it on their own, personally. You know, let it be theirs - a personal relationship with their soul, or their God, or with their church.","Very intense first summer out, to be 18 years old and never having gone on a date, never having smoked a cigarette, never had a drink, even a sip of beer, never kissed a girl, all of those things. It made for a fairly intense first year out.","I went whole hog at the actor's lifestyle - really embraced it. I had by then known how much I loved acting already, because I discovered acting from a teacher in the seminary - that's the first place I ever did it, in the seminary.","At the end of four years' time, at graduation, we were down to 12. At our reunion that we had several years ago, only 1 out of the 52 actually made it to ordination and priesthood. So there you go, there's your numbers.","Interesting enough, we had a reunion of the 12 of us who graduated, right? The only one who wasn't there was the guy who became a priest, and he was literally in prison in Libya, for being a Catholic priest. Isn't that interesting? Everybody else made the reunion but that guy.","I'm very cautious about talking about how actors got where they got, as though there is in fact a plan or a way. There is no plan, there is no way, there's no sure set, there's no handbook, on how to get to be an actor."],"Peter Krause":["It sounds so trite but in relationships, you have to communicate.","I think that being a conscious parent opens your eyes to the fact that any adult relationships that you have, whenever children are present on a daily basis, that they're modeling how they get along with people by what they see how you get along.","Well I'm not much of a singer. But it's been a really nice time to do film, television, theater and have it all happening at once. That wasn't planned but it just happens.","At this point, I'm spoiled. I've actually had a really blessed career.","My bones are tired from all the tragedy in me.","And then, all of a sudden, you're like, all that's great and fun, but Arthur Miller's in my dressing room. This is the third night he's been here and he sits in my dressing room for an hour after each show, and talks to me for an hour. So I'm pretty spoiled right now.","I started college Pre-Med. That lasted about half a semester.","I think that every show on television has its place. I think Married With Children or, I don't know, The Nanny... some people want to go home, turn on the TV and be able to iron their clothes or grab a sandwich. Come out and catch a joke and not have to follow the story.","We live in a country where people still get beaten to death because of their sexual orientation.","I'm pretty political when it comes to human rights and things like that.","I don't smack him around. I don't yell at him. And if he wants to go to the park in his pajamas, I don't care.","I'm moved to think about the political state of our country right now. Most people who go out and vote have a very clear sense of what's right and wrong. And a lot of those people who don't aren't sure, so they don't go out and vote.","I'm very wary of large groups of people getting together and trying to believe the same thing. It never seems to end well, whether it's political or religious or whatever.","People are first and foremost Republicans, first and foremost Anarchists, first and foremost a man or woman, and that is a mistake. It hurts the individual and it hurts the whole.","I got to portray a park ranger on 'Gilmore Girls,' the reunion films. And when I was a kid, that was one of the things that I wanted to be - I wanted to be a forest ranger or park ranger.","I have the ability to move around without being recognized all the time. I mean, you want to be famous - but not too famous.","Making a television show is a difficult, collaborative, creative endeavor, and it really requires everybody to band together and all work together every day.","The best shows I've done, the writers, actors, and directors have been pretty much left alone - maybe given a little guidance to make it a little more this or more that. But the heavier the hand on the show, I find, the more troubled the show is.","I'm apparently attracted to things that are on the edge of what America really wants to watch: 'Six Feet Under,' 'Sports Night,' 'Dirty Sexy Money,' and 'Parenthood' were always struggling in the ratings. It was kind of heartbreaking not knowing if we get to come back every season.","Losing your patience and your temper isn't the most attractive thing, but as kids get older, you wind up raising your voice.","I'm a science geek. I even have a T-shirt with a glow-in-the-dark chart of the periodic elements."],"Peter Kreeft":["God's interventions are miracles: events that cannot happen by merely natural agents but only by a supernatural agent. They no more interfere with our free will than natural events like earthquakes. We choose how to respond to them.","The most compelling evidence for God's existence is Christ. If God does not exist, then Christ was the biggest fool who ever lived.","Our life here on Earth has as its purpose precisely to prepare for our eternal happiness. This world is a large womb. It is a 'test' as all opportunities are tests.","God allows unjust disparities between rich and poor because He does not miraculously intervene to establish justice against human wills. Also, discrepancies are not unjust by themselves; justice does not mean equality of result but equality of opportunity.","You don't have to convince Muslims of God's existence or importance.","Anyone, without exception, can know God if they really want to simply by praying, by honestly telling Him that they want to know Him. He always responds to honest seekers. Jesus promised, 'All who seek, find.'","All human beings have a right to life. Our unborn children are members of the human race. They're human beings, so they have a right to life.","A woman has a responsibility and a privilege that a man doesn't have of given birth to another human being."],"Peter Kropotkin":["Have not prisons - which kill all will and force of character in man, which enclose within their walls more vices than are met with on any other spot of the globe - always been universities of crime?","The law is an adroit mixture of customs that are beneficial to society, and could be followed even if no law existed, and others that are of advantage to a ruling minority, but harmful to the masses of men, and can be enforced on them only by terror.","America is just the country that how all the written guarantees in the world for freedom are no protection against tyranny and oppression of the worst kind. There the politician has come to be looked upon as the very scum of society."],"Peter L. Bergen":["Every lethal terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11 has been carried out by an American citizen or a legal permanent resident, not by recent immigrants or by refugees. So tamping down immigration won't fix the real issue, which is 'homegrown' terrorism.","The Japanese scored an important victory at Pearl Harbor, but the attack pulled the United States into World War II, and four years later, Japan was in ruins, utterly defeated.","Trump's pronounced anti-immigrant stance is reminiscent of both Le Pen in France and Orban in Hungary, although he is far from alone in taking such positions in much of today's Republican Party.","The dangers of TATP bombs can be seen in the case of Matthew Rugo and Curtis Jetton, 21-year-old roommates in Texas City, Texas. They didn't have any bomb-making training and were manufacturing explosives in 2006 from concentrated bleach when their concoction blew up, killing Rugo and injuring Jetton.","European countries simply do not have the ideological framework the United States has in the shape of the 'American dream' that has helped to absorb successfully wave after wave of immigration to the States, including Muslim Americans who are well integrated into American society. There is no analogous French dream or German dream.","Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad belongs to the small Alawite sect and is therefore considered a heretic by many Sunnis; al-Assad runs a secular regime, and therefore he is considered by Sunni militants to be an apostate, and he is inflicting a total war on his Sunni population.","There is considerable merit to the notion of treating gun violence as a public health matter.","The Second Amendment is, of course, very much part of the American fabric. But the intent of the founders was that the amendment protected the rights of citizens to bear arms in a militia for their collective self-defense.","The image we have of bin Laden in his final years in Abbottabad is of an aging man with a graying beard watching old footage of himself; just another suburban dad flipping though the channels with his remote.","Bin Laden was 200 miles away from the area where all of these drone strikes were taking out his key leaders, he was able to indulge in his hobbies... and he was making occasional video tapes and audio tapes to the wider world.","I stepped into the bedroom where he was killed and looked up at the ceiling, where you could still see the patterns of blood that had spurted from bin Laden's head when the bullet fired by a U.S. Navy SEAL tore through the terrorist leader's face.","Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein brutally repressed all forms of opposition to his regime, and before the Iraq War, al Qaeda had no presence in Iraq.","Certain Gulf Arabs support proxy jihadist Sunni groups such as al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, while Iran supports Shia militant forces such as Hezbollah.","Islam is, to be sure, a big tent, and the one and a half billion Muslims in the world run the gamut from mystical, moderate, pacific Sufis to Salafists.","Common sense would tell you that the idea that Saudi Arabia was paying for bin Laden's expenses while he was living in Abbottabad is simply risible. Bin Laden's principal goal was the overthrow of the Saudi royal family as a result of which his Saudi citizenship was revoked as far back as 1994.","Trump himself has not laid out a clear agenda on the national security issues that are the most pressing for the United States, from the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan to the deepening Syrian civil war to the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria and the flexing of Russian muscles under President Vladimir Putin.","In Syria, a no-fly zone targeted at Assad's air force and safe zones for refugees fleeing the fighting would help tamp down the death toll that plays into the hands of ISIS and other Sunni militants who can position themselves as the only groups that are really defending the Sunni population.","Like the attack on Pearl Harbor, another hinge event in American history, 9/11 was a great tactical victory for America's enemies. But in both these cases, the tactical success of the attacks was not matched by strategic victories. Quite the reverse.","It is in Pakistan's own interest that the Afghan army is able to fight effectively against the Taliban, which is more likely if they continue to have American advisers at their side.","Anwar al-Awlaki was a U.S. citizen by virtue of his birth in Las Cruces, New Mexico, in 1971 while his Yemeni father was studying at New Mexico State University.","Pakistan's key leaders have succumbed to the assassin's bullet or bomb or the hangman's noose, and the country has seen four military coups since its birth in 1947. Yet the Pakistani polity has limped on.","Bin Laden's death is just a punctuation point on a set of problems they've had for a long time. I think the prognosis for al-Qaida and groups like it is really bad, and that's a good thing.","I've interviewed multiple people who know bin Laden... who tend to have a universal picture of what he's like, which is: modest, retiring, unassuming, kind of thoughtful - lots of things that don't fit with a mass murderer, which he is as well.","We climbed the stairs to the third floor, where Osama bin Laden died early in the morning of May 2, 2011.","In February I secured permission to enter Osama bin Laden's compound in the northern Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where he was killed and where he had lived for the last half-decade of his life; the first, and only, journalist to do so.","So Pakistan is a country that I'm very fond of and have spent a lot of time, but it is a country where conspiracy theories have a life of their own.","Bin Laden comes out of a business background - he studied public administration and economics at university, and he worked for his family company, which was obviously a rather successful enterprise.","At one point people in al Qaeda were actually drawing monthly paychecks when they were based in Sudan.","I am very suspicious of the notion that somehow bin Laden was a media creation... Bin Laden's actions made him into a big deal. Not the media.","Often it is important to listen to what people aren't saying.","And in the end, bin Laden died in a squalid suburban compound surrounded by his wives and children and far from the front lines of his holy war.","What is tricky for those hoping to utilize such weapons is that TATP bombs are quite difficult to make because their ingredients, when combined, are highly unstable and can explode easily if mishandled.","Occasionally, Donald Trump says something that is politically incorrect but which also happens to be true.","The centerpiece of the Bush administration's case for going to war in Iraq was Secretary of State Colin Powell's presentation to the U.N. Security Council on February 5, 2003, six weeks before the invasion.","Trump has claimed he knows more about ISIS than America's leading generals. Clearly, this is also total nonsense; he doesn't seem to have done the slightest thing to educate himself about ISIS.","The rise of ISIS starts with a Jordanian thug named Abu Musab al-Zarqawi who founded ISIS' parent organization, al Qaeda, in Iraq. What gave Zarqawi the opportunity to create al Qaeda in Iraq? It was, of course, George W. Bush's decision to invade Iraq in 2003.","Virulent anti-Semitism is, of course, a staple of militant Islamist ideology.","The reason that Islamist militants can assert that jihad is necessary against the perceived enemies of Islam is that there is sufficient ammunition in the Quran to buttress their beliefs. The same could also, of course, be said for the Old Testament, which is full of scenes of violent death visited on the enemies of God.","Seymour Hersh is one of the giants of investigative journalism.","Hersh's account of the bin Laden raid is a farrago of nonsense that is contravened by a multitude of eyewitness accounts, inconvenient facts, and simple common sense.","I was the only outsider to visit the Abbottabad compound where bin Laden lived before the Pakistani military demolished it.","The fact is, working stiffs with few opportunities and scant education are generally too busy getting by to engage in revolutionary projects to remake society. And history, in fact, shows us that terrorism is generally a bourgeois endeavor.","The diagnosis that poverty, lack of education, or lack of opportunities have much to do with terrorism requires a fundamentally optimistic view of human nature. This diagnosis leads to the prognosis that all we need to do to solve the terrorism problem is to create societies that are less poor, better educated and have more opportunities.","ISIS may be a perversion of Islam, but Islamic it is, just as Christian beliefs about the sanctity of the unborn child explain why some Christian fundamentalists attack abortion clinics and doctors.","Trump, of course, has been very wrong in the past about important issues such as President Barack Obama's place of birth and Mexican immigrants, but the Republican frontrunner is correct in saying that former Republican President George W. Bush did not keep the country safe during the 9/11 terrorist attacks.","Bush administration officials, of course, deny that they didn't take the threat urgently enough, but there is no debating that in their public utterances, private meetings, and actions, the al Qaeda threat barely registered.","The inattention of the Bush administration to the threat from al Qaeda had results. Shortly before 9/11, Bush's attorney general, John Ashcroft, turned down FBI requests for some 400 additional counterterrorism personnel.","There is no hint that Trump wishes to engage in or to foment violence against the enemies, such as immigrants, he has identified as undermining the American way of life.","Trump displays many of the traits of a proto-fascist, and he is also part of a wave of right-wing nationalist movements that is sweeping the West. He can also be positioned in the long, American right-wing tradition of fearing 'the Other,' whether they are Catholics or Jews or, now, Muslims.","If the party of Lincoln wishes to become the party of intolerance, selecting Trump to be its presidential candidate is a good way forward.","What made al-Awlaki so influential is that, unlike a number of leaders of al Qaeda such as Osama bin Laden, he was a cleric, so he could present himself as a leading religious figure. Second, because al-Awlaki had spent much of his adult life in the States, he communicated with his followers in colloquial, accessible American English.","Six years after al-Awlaki was born, his family moved back to Yemen, but he returned to the States for college and remained there for much of his adult life.","President Obama and a small team of senior national security officials were in the unusual position of acting as al-Awlaki's jury, judges, and de facto executioners.","Apostasy is a grave crime in Islam and punishable by death in the eyes of members of al Qaeda.","The civil war across the Middle East between the Shia and the Sunni empowers groups like ISIS and al Qaeda who claim to be the defenders of Sunni rights against Shia attack.","Think of ISIS as a pathogen that preys on weak hosts in the Muslim world. In fact, there is something of a political law: The weaker a Muslim state, the stronger will be the presence of ISIS or like-minded groups.","For many terrorists, carrying out an attack allowed them to become the heroes of their own story.","The E.U. is the latest of a series of multinational organizations set up after World War II to ensure that there would never again be a pan-European war and to create the conditions for a new European prosperity after the destruction wrought by the war against the Nazis. The E.U. has admirably succeeded at both.","Because Scotland and Northern Ireland want to remain part of the E.U., there is the quite real possibility that Scotland and even Northern Ireland might now choose to go their own way on membership within the E.U. and the 'United Kingdom' would suddenly effectively be only England and Wales.","American jihadists are generally motivated by a mix of factors, including dislike of U.S. foreign policy in the Muslim world.","For many, embracing the ideology of Osama bin Laden or ISIS allowed them to become the heroes of their own story as well as actors in a cosmic crusade. For others, a 'cognitive opening' to militant Islam was often precipitated by a personal disappointment or loss.","Tamerlan Tsarnaev, one of the two brothers who carried out the marathon bombing, was a non-practicing Muslim who only became an Islamist militant once his dreams of becoming an Olympic boxer faded. At the time of the attack, he was unemployed.","Since Trump is not quick to forgive the merest of slights, it's hard to imagine him calling on any of the officials who have publicly taken a stand against him to serve in key national security slots.","Trump has long been a fan of Vladimir Putin but seems to be unaware that Russia's goal in Syria is simply the maintenance of its longtime ally President Bashar al-Assad in power. Indeed, Moscow has hitherto shown little appetite to focus on ISIS.","The reality is that Trump's focus on immigrants is to misconceive of the terrorist problem that exists in the United States.","Syria is attracting a lot more Westerners than the Iraq War ever did because it's the perfect Sunni jihad.","Information-sharing between Western governments about the identities of those who have traveled to Syria and have received militant training is the key to preventing more incidents such as the one at the Jewish Museum in Brussels.","A key flaw of the Obama administration's approach to Afghanistan has been constantly announcing proposed withdrawal dates for U.S. forces, which has enabled the Taliban to believe they can simply wait out the clock.","It is very much in America's national security interests to ensure that the Taliban do not dominate Afghanistan and that neither ISIS nor al Qaeda continues their growth in the country.","In short, the hunt for bin Laden could not have been accomplished without every form of American intelligence-gathering.","'Zero Dark Thirty' is a great piece of filmmaking and does a valuable public service by raising difficult questions most Hollywood movies shy away from, but as of this writing, it seems that one of its central themes - that torture was instrumental to tracking down bin Laden - is not supported by the facts.","While the story about the hunt for bin Laden has been exhaustively reported and the key sources and witnesses are in agreement about the main points of the narrative, of course, it's still possible that we could learn new details about the story that would add to the narrative.","What did U.S. officials have to lose by saying that bin Laden was being protected by the Pakistanis, if it were true?","President-elect Donald Trump has a host of national security challenges to deal with as he assumes office, from the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan to the grinding Syrian civil war to the flexing of Russian muscles under President Vladimir Putin to how to deal with ISIS as the terrorist army retreats in Iraq.","During the campaign, Trump in many ways repudiated President Obama's national security and foreign policy approach on issues like the Iran nuclear deal and immigration. So there's a real question of continuity or disruption with Trump, which wouldn't have existed if Clinton was president-elect.","Trump has long said he favors a 'safe zone' in Syria to prevent Basher al Assad's regime from carrying out indiscriminate airstrikes against Syrian civilians and to halt the refugee flow out of Syria.","The deep problems that afflict the Middle East are not easy to fix, but they must be dealt with if we are not to see a son of ISIS, or even a grandson of ISIS, developing in the years to come.","For Islamist terrorist groups such as ISIS, the holy month of Ramadan - a time of fasting and prayer for the vast majority of Muslims - is seen as a particularly auspicious time to launch terrorist attacks."],"Peter L. Berger":["The negative side to globalization is that it wipes out entire economic systems and in doing so wipes out the accompanying culture.","We also have a cultural phenomenon: the emergence of a global culture, or of cultural globalization.","The basic fault lines today are not between people with different beliefs but between people who hold these beliefs with an element of uncertainty and people who hold these beliefs with a pretense of certitude.","I think what I and most other sociologists of religion wrote in the 1960s about secularization was a mistake. Our underlying argument was that secularization and modernity go hand in hand. With more modernization comes more secularization.","In a market economy, however, the individual has some possibility of escaping from the power of the state.","The past is malleable and flexible, changing as our recollection interprets and re-explains what has happened.","But we don't have an example of a democratic society existing in a socialist economy - which is the only real alternative to capitalism in the modern world.","Even if one is interested only in one's own society, which is one's prerogative, one can understand that society much better by comparing it with others.","Even in a society as tightly controlled as Singapore's, the market creates certain forces which perhaps in the long run may lead to democracy.","I'm sure Putnam is right that there's been a decline in certain kinds of organizations like bowling leagues. But people participate in communities in other ways.","If the cultural elite has its way, the U.S. will be much more like Europe.","If you say simply that pressures toward democracy are created by the market, I would say yes.","It has been true in Western societies and it seems to be true elsewhere that you do not find democratic systems apart from capitalism, or apart from a market economy, if you prefer that term.","Let me say again that the relationship is asymmetrical: there's no democracy without a market economy, but you can have a market economy without democracy.","One can't understand the Christian Right and similar movements unless one sees them as reactive - they're reacting to what they call secular humanism.","Our institute's agenda is relatively simple. We study the relationship between social-economic change and culture. By culture we mean beliefs, values and lifestyles. We cover a broad range of issues, and we work very internationally.","So I think one can say on empirical grounds - not because of some philosophical principle - that you can't have democracy unless you have a market economy.","Some people seem to gravitate from one fundamentalism to another, from some kind of secular fundamentalism into a religious fundamentalism or the other way around, which is not very helpful.","Some people think that as the Chinese economy becomes more and more capitalistic it will inevitably become more democratic.","The problem with liberal Protestantism in America is not that it has not been orthodox enough, but that it has lost a lot of religious substance.","There is a continuum of values between the churches and the general community. What distinguishes the handling of these values in the churches is mainly the heavier dosage of religious vocabulary involved.","When certain branches of the economy become obsolete, as in the case of the steel industry, not only do jobs disappear, which is obviously a terrible social hardship, but certain cultures also disappear."],"Peter Landesman":["Life only has narrative when we frame it and edit it and call it certain things.","One way to test a picture's integrity is to turn it upside down - a technique used not only by connoisseurs but also by artists trying to see their work with a fresh eye.","A museum's meticulous presentation - exhaustive captions, hushed lighting, state-of-the-art armature - creates an institutional authority that is constructed to seem impregnable.","Life is itself an occupational hazard. Sometimes the things we love hurt us. Embracing and navigating around that contradiction is part of what it is to be alive.","There will always been the prurient rubbernecking aspect to disasters: people who just can't get enough gore.","Salvador Dali, lying on his deathbed in a stupor, is said to have been fed thousands of sheets of blank paper to sign for fake lithographs.","I can't worry about the consequences of what I do; that's not my job.","There was absolutely zero discourse between me or anybody at the studio with the NFL. None. The only exchange was one-sentence e-mails trying to arrange a meeting, before deciding to cancel the meeting. Period. End of story.","I did nothing at the behest of the NFL, for the NFL, against the NFL.","There's a constant dialogue going back and forth between the filmmakers and the producers.","I had a very strong background in journalism, so it's my instinct to try to be as fair and accurate as possible.","When a director is also a writer, everyone on the production looks to him, knowing he gave birth to the idea. There's a different level of viability.","Once you turn on the camera, making a movie is making a movie. I don't care if it's $9 million dollars or $50 million dollars. You have bigger toys, bigger set, actors who are better paid, but once you turn on the camera, it's director and performance, and I don't find a big difference.","You have to find the movie in the editing room, and it can't be four hours; it has to be two hours.","My personal sources in the intelligence community and the military are very good. They're excellent. I have very high-up, in-depth sources.","When you're researching something for a movie, you get a very different kind of reaction than when you're researching something for an article for 'The New York Times.'","My politics are very centrist and sometimes, especially when it comes to foreign affairs, lean to the right.","Most editors are just worried about their jobs. They're overwhelmed. They're underpaid. They do the best they can.","I was doing an investigative article on arms trafficking that was taking me through Eastern Europe and the Middle East. And after I had interviewed a helicopter pilot who had been ferrying weapons into Liberia, I realized as I left the restaurant that I was being followed and set up for an ambush.","I was a painter before I was a writer, so I was always a visual artist. And my writing, to me, was always visual.","I started writing screenplays myself and eventually directing.","Documentaries for me always felt kind of limiting. I wanted to go bigger. And I also love actors, and I love performance. So feature filmmaking was always the intent.","I love football. I played it into two years of college.","Sony is the only studio without broadcast relationships with the NFL.","Will Smith is the most successful money-making movie star on planet Earth, in terms of just how many people have gone to see his films, so Will is a guy who gets movies made.","I love the game. I love to watch. I watch it with my kids. I'm able to divorce the beauty of the athletics from the corporate entity that is the National Football League.","What interested me was the story of Bennet Omalu. You hear his narrative: Immigrant from Nigeria, landing in Pittsburgh, only to learn and tell the truth about this most American - and sacrosanct - cultural institution: the NFL.","I am an old journalist, so I always do a lot of research and dive deep into people's character, who they are, and their motivation.","To me, film is the most complete method of storytelling.","Film brings together framing and light and color and performance and music and all of that. To me, everything I've done in my life has been preparing me for filmmaking.","I don't actually see that much difference between telling stories in journalism and telling them on film. The tools are very different, but the basic idea is the same.","As a journalist, as a screenwriter and as a director, I'm trying to tell compelling and truthful stories.","Sometimes, in a fictional story, you can be more honest and truthful, actually. As a journalist, you're a prisoner of the data, in effect. You have to tell the story with evidence you can verify.","I played football the whole time I was growing up, and through two years of college. I think it's a beautiful game in many respects, one that allows you to follow a player from boyhood through manhood.","I was a war correspondent. I've watched great people crumble under pressure and make bad decisions.","Tom Hanks comes with a lot of credibility.","I'm Jewish, not Catholic, but I'm a spiritual person.","It's very dangerous for a storyteller to walk into a situation with a political agenda because you end up telling a story about issues instead of telling a story about people.","I'd followed the strange deaths of pro football players for years, sensing something odd going on.","I start each of my scripts by going on a journey of painstaking research and discovery, much as I do a piece of long-lead journalism.","As a filmmaker, it's not my intent to trigger or shape national discourse. My task is to make as powerful and understandable a film as I can. What happens next is what happens next.","The village of Polgardi is a dusty roadside settlement northeast of Lake Balaton, a resort area in western Hungary popular with German tourists.","The itinerary of most antiquities from their source - tomb, temple, quarry - to the shelves of museums or private collectors is murky and often purposely concealed.","Melted down, silver is worth a little more than four dollars an ounce. But carved, inlaid, and engraved, and identified with a particular year, it becomes the direct reflection, often the literal record, of human history, our movement through time.","Large corporations have the ability to distract people with controversy that just distracts people from what's great about the movie or what works about the movie.","The story of Bennet Omalu is a riveting story; it's just a riveting tale. I knew from the beginning if I stayed close to that kind of storytelling and focussed on the character, then the other stuff comes along with it, and the message becomes baked into the journey.","People go to the movies to have an emotional experience, not to learn information they could look up on Wikipedia.","I always spend a good deal of time with the people I write about. I try and smell the normalcy of their lives. I try to look at the normal rhythm of their life.","I was a war correspondent and journalist for a long time, and I was very near the towers on 9/11 and very shortly after in Afghanistan.","I love writing in compressed time periods because the act of survival in the midst of panic and fear, that's where true heroism comes. If you have a uniform, and you're expected to do things, it's a sort of incremental heroism.","I've been writing screenplays for a long time, and a lot of it came out of the journalism I was doing.","I was a painter, then a novelist, then a journalist, then a screenwriter, and now I'm a director, and it feels all part of the same continuum. One led to the other, and it just feels like the natural confluence of all the ways of storytelling that I've been doing for almost 30 years.","Our brains have this habit of quilting dreams from the fabrics of our lives. As a filmmaker, I get to do it for a living.","'Writing' is the wrong way to describe what happens to words in a movie. First, you put down words. Then you rehearse them with actors. Then you shoot the words. Then you edit them. You cut a lot of them, you fudge them, you make up new ones in voice-over. Then you cut it and throw it all away.","When it came to 'Concussion,' I found myself with so many threads to weave. So integral to the whistle-blower's tale were spirituality, the cost of hero-worshipping, what it means to be an American, and just how dangerous the truth can be.","What I learned is that there are indeed some stories that are too true to tell, too revealing for the general population to metabolize. And too challenging to your reporter colleagues, whose turf or toes you might have tread upon.","Like every other industry or institution, the journalism world is populated by the petty and fearful, in addition to the courageous and brilliant.","Film is probably the medium best suited to reach the most people - the visual, the aural, the limbic, the intellectual: it captures all these parts of our mind and soul. No other art form comes close.","Even the two novels I've written were based on true stories. It's how I'm wired - real life is fascinating and fantastical enough. The kind of journalism I did unpeeled lids from cans otherwise sealed.","'Parkland' is not out to pick a fight and start a dialogue about conspiracy.","I wouldn't let my children play football.","I consider myself neither liberal nor conservative when it comes to foreign policy.","We've all seen 'Network' and 'Wag the Dog,' but we were somehow insulated by the fact that those were just movies, fictions, and we could rest easy that the Real News doesn't operate that way. Well, it does - sometimes.","Hard information on the quantity of bogus art sold is difficult to come by, in part because fraud, when discovered by dealers and auction houses, is usually kept secret to boost public confidence in the art market.","Modern art, in particular, seems especially vulnerable to fraud. Its abstractions are sometimes difficult to understand or grasp, and a modern painting is often loved less because of its intrinsic quality - its beauty, as conventionally understood - than because of the identity of the painter, its mark of social status.","Serious collectors and art experts, among the world's most educated, often cannot fathom the possibility of being rooked, and then once taken, cannot face the humiliation of admitting it.","Each year, tens of millions of museumgoers walk through the entrance of the Getty, or the Metropolitan or the Prado or the Hermitage, and never consider the possibility of having to arbitrate for themselves the authenticity of what they have come to see.","14th- and 15th-century drawings are almost unheard-of - and as a result, they generate jealous desire among dealers and curators. Museums in particular value rarity and pedigree more than attractiveness.","Refugees tend to avoid planes, airports and fake passports, even though flying may appear to be the most obvious way to flee. For one thing, security procedures at airports are far stricter than at land borders.","The trains that travel the Chunnel are massive machines. The Eurostars are bullet-shaped and a quarter-mile long. They are pulled by a 136,000-pound locomotive and move in the open air at 185 m.p.h. and through the tunnel at 100 m.p.h."],"Peter Latham":["Remedies, indeed, are our great analysers of disease.","Fortunate indeed, is the man who takes exactly the right measure of himself, and holds a just balance between what he can acquire and what he can use.","Poisons and medicine are oftentimes the same substance given with different intents.","Perfect health, like perfect beauty, is a rare thing; and so, it seems, is perfect disease.","Common sense is in medicine the master workman."],"Peter Lawford":["Metro was really a star-builder, no doubt about that. You were wrapped in cotton wool.","I was a halfway-decent-looking English boy who looked nice in a drawing-room standing by a piano.","Despite everything, I have few regrets. I have crammed a lot of living into my time."],"Peter Lerangis":["I have an oval-shaped scar on the knuckle of my right index finger from crashing my hand through a light fixture while practicing Elvis Presley moves in college.","I love to travel. During normal workdays, sometimes it feels like I have to bludgeon ideas out of my soul - but when I'm traveling, relaxed and unpressured, the ideas just spill out.","I can't contain how enthusiastic I am about working on books for kids.","When I set up my Web site, I made a guestbook so kids can write to me there, and that's become one of the most popular parts of the site.","With the '39 Clues,' we were making history jump out of the page for the readers, so they don't know they're learning. The kids can't put the books down - it's so exciting.","I like helping other writers who don't know what to do or where to go in New York.","I'm a children's book writer, and my wife is a musician. We've raised a family on income from songs, performances and books.","On scores of sites, users can upload illegal files of my books. As per 1998's toothless Digital Millennium Copyright Act, I bear the burden of discovering and reporting each theft.","SOPA has been described as hitting a carpet tack with a sledgehammer. But technology was a sledgehammer to the music industry, one that allowed digital distributors like Apple to grow rich.","Big Tech's nonchalance about copyright violation tramples over people like my wife and me, who strive to make a living in the great tradition of the creative realm."],"Peter Levine":["There's going to be a symbiotic relationship between the edge and the cloud.","It doesn't matter what's written on a coffee mug or on a 'culture' slide; what you do as a CEO, day in and day out, and how you behave will define your company's culture.","Probably, if I created a venture fund, I would create a firm with virtual services not too different from the a16z model, but without employing people. So I would get CPOs, engineering talent, marketing people who wanted to be involved with the venture fund and provide services.","The organization reflects the behavior and characteristics of the CEO, and that establishes the culture. Foster an environment of open communication, and the organization inherits a culture of open communication.","Despite the best intentions, companies often become culturally dysfunctional. This occurs when leadership has a perception about the culture that conflicts with reality, or leadership behaves differently than what might be written down.","A self-driving car will have 200-plus CPUs. That's a data center on wheels.","I look at Boston-based companies all the time... There's certainly great companies in Boston. If the deal makes sense on the merit of the deal itself, we'll go and do the deal.","When I was a developer, I couldn't buy a pencil. I had no budget, nothing.","Old companies that had nothing to do with software in the past all have software development activities to unlock the invention that's occurring inside of these organizations. And so the developer is a very important part of that overall ecosystem.","If you look back over the history of computing, it started as mainframes or terminals. As PCs or work stations became prevalent, computing moved to the edge, and we had applications that took advantage of edge computing and the CPU and processing power at the edge. Cloud computing brought things back to the center.","There has been an ebb and flow in enterprise IT of centralized versus distributed.","I think with the proliferation of mobile devices and then, eventually, the Internet of Things, we literally have supercomputers in our pockets and supercomputers that will hang on telephone poles and in light bulbs.","If you believe that the mobile phone is the next supercomputer, which I do, you can imagine a datacenter that is modeled after, literally, hundreds or thousands or millions of mobile phones. They won't have screens on them, but there'll be millions of lightweight mobile-phone processors in the datacenter.","Technical co-founders are great at envisioning where the company's going from a strategic standpoint. They have what I call the 'gut-feel' of building out their business.","It's easier to coach a technical founder how to be CEO and manage a business than it is to teach a professional CEO the nuances of that particular business.","With the premise that we look for technical co-founders to run a company, I view myself as being a coach to that technical co-founder. I can help them with their business issues, with the growth issues of taking a company from a very early stage to something much larger.","As a former CEO and senior executive, there was a time when I did not quite understand the profound impact a CEO has on the culture of a company, even though I always knew culture was important.","When you and I go to work, and we use a computer to work and find that our work apps are completely onerous and the apps we use at home are quite easy, we wonder, why can't it be simpler, easier, quicker, and less expensive?","I can certainly imagine a day where task workers, enterprise workers no longer communicate via email but instead use some social vehicle that looks a lot like consumer social networks we see today.","Doing processing locally has its advantages. For instance, the cost of an endpoint CPU and memory is a 1000x cheaper than the cost of CPU and memory in the server. And in many places around the world, connectivity and transmission costs are sometimes far more expensive than the device.","In the old days, I'd have to go as a company, buy computer resources, buy servers, buy storage, and lash it all together. It took a long time to stand up. Now, if I need, I can go to Amazon or Rackspace and buy some computer power nearly instantaneously.","I have really become a huge believer in the power of open source.","When you are only one vendor, there is a very low rate of innovation. You think the old architecture is just fine, and it can just happily exist for many years."],"Peter Lewis Allen":["Medical research in the twentieth century mostly takes place in the lab; in the Renaissance, though, researchers went first and foremost to the library to see what the ancients had said.","The idea of infection began to be taken far more seriously than it ever had before. Hospitals transformed themselves in response to the new plague - sometimes for the better, but often for the worse, as when, in fear, they cast their ulcerated patients out into the streets.","Perhaps more than any other disease before or since, syphilis in early modern Europe provoked the kind of widespread moral panic that AIDS revived when it struck America in the 1980s.","Often, city fathers blamed prostitutes for the disease, and some threatened to brand their cheeks with hot iron if they did not desist from their vices.","Even more than this, however, the sick - like lepers - were often reviled because people believed that they had brought their torments upon themselves.","Was this an old disease, and, if so, which one? If it was new, what did that say about the state of medical knowledge? And in any case, how could physicians make sense of it?"],"Peter Lindbergh":["For me, every photograph is a portrait; the clothes are just a vehicle for what I want to say. You're photographing a relationship with the person you're shooting; there's an exchange, and that's what that picture is.","Photography gives you the opportunity to use your sensibility and everything you are to say something about and be part of the world around you. In this way, you might discover who you are, and with a little luck, you might discover something much larger than yourself.","The photographer, even in fashion and portraiture, has to have a standpoint. It's important to know what you stand for, no? Most people just take pictures, but they stand for nothing. They follow trends and don't know why.","Fashion photographers are the new painters.","The most important part of fashion photography, for me, is not the models; it's not the clothes. It's that you are responsible for defining what a woman today is. That, I think, is my job.","If photographers are responsible for creating or reflecting an image of women in society, then, I must say, there is only one way for the future, and this is to define women as strong and independent. This should be the responsibility of photographers today: to free women, and finally everyone, from the terror of youth and perfection.","People think that it is important to learn by assisting the great photographers. I say that is a big mistake. Be happy; just learn from any little guy. Learn how to use the camera - you don't need anything else. You can't be taught the real skill anyway.","Heartless retouching should not be the chosen tool to represent women in the beginning of this century.","My first obsession was actually sports. I was a very good handball goalkeeper. With special permission, I played in the premier league in Germany before I was even old enough.","A lot of mainstream photographers seem not to think about what they're doing or feel any responsibility toward anything. By the time they're done, the models don't have any trace of themselves left. This thing about looking young with no wrinkles or expression is all so boring, really.","Fashion photography should say something about the stability of a certain time you live in or what kind of women you like. The most interesting thing is not what they're wearing but who they are.","In the beginning of my twenties, I started transcendental meditation. For years, I did nothing else. Every holiday, I went to courses. Meditation is a real simple instrument. You don't need a long beard or a sari. It's meant to bring you to yourself. It's as easy as that.","Fashion is about change, don't you think?","Now there is this whole terror about getting old. Today, that fascination with youth is overrated. What's so special about being young? I just say that because I'm old.","I have not taken inspiration from the fashion shows. I don't even really go to too many of the fashion shows - and have not for 15 years - because I don't want to be inspired by the same things as everyone else. If everyone is inspired by the same things, then of course, you all do the same pictures.","To go somewhere where nobody knows you, and to keep your eyes open... That was a beautiful concept in terms of putting yourself in a place to be inspired.","I show elements of the set in my pictures because it's not real. When I see movies, I often love the 'making of' more than the movie itself. It's not so final. When you have a woman just standing there, it doesn't mean much.","These days, photographers have expensive contracts with actresses, but then the actresses have to have their names written in the column because nobody recognizes them. That's kind of strange.","You cannot say that one woman is 'more beautiful' than another, though people always do. It's so ridiculous to say that.","There's something else that makes a woman interesting, something beyond being young or being old. And I'm going to find out what that something else is before I die, I hope."],"Peter Loftin":["I'm just like any other man. I understand why people become reclusive. One of my weaknesses is that I sometimes allow people in that shouldn't be in my life.","I like being successful. Giving back is just a part of that."],"Peter Lombard":["Therefore when the mind knows itself and loves itself, there remains a trinity, that is the mind, love and knowledge.","Therefore the elect shall go forth... to see the torments of the impious, seeing which they will not be grieved, but will be satiated with joy at the sight of the unutterable calamity of the impious.","But the mind is here accepted not for the soul, but for that which is the more excellent in the soul."],"Peter Lynch":["Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Suicide is a choice and I think if we work with that with kids, we'll get somewhere.","Everyone has the brainpower to follow the stock market. If you made it through fifth-grade math, you can do it.","The real key to making money in stocks is not to get scared out of them.","Improved turnout will give parliament and government the appearance of being more legitimate.","The person that turns over the most rocks wins the game. And that's always been my philosophy.","If you go to Minnesota in January, you should know that it's gonna be cold. You don't panic when the thermometer falls below zero.","I've found that when the market's going down and you buy funds wisely, at some point in the future you will be happy. You won't get there by reading 'Now is the time to buy.'","You get recessions, you have stock market declines. If you don't understand that's going to happen, then you're not ready, you won't do well in the markets.","Go for a business that any idiot can run - because sooner or later, any idiot probably is going to run it.","If all the economists in the world were laid end to end, it wouldn't be a bad thing.","When stocks are attractive, you buy them. Sure, they can go lower. I've bought stocks at $12 that went to $2, but then they later went to $30. You just don't know when you can find the bottom.","It's human nature to keep doing something as long as it's pleasurable and you can succeed at it - which is why the world population continues to double every 40 years.","I think you have to learn that there's a company behind every stock, and that there's only one real reason why stocks go up. Companies go from doing poorly to doing well or small companies grow to large companies.","Don't bottom fish.","I don't go near the money and the money doesn't go near me.","Although it's easy to forget sometimes, a share is not a lottery ticket... it's part-ownership of a business.","So while I was in college I did a little study on the freight industry, the air freight industry. And I looked at this company called Flying Tiger. And I actually put a thousand dollars in it and I remember I thought this air cargo was going to be a thing of the future.","I've always been a great lover of baseball.","Well, I think the secret is if you have a lot of stocks, some will do mediocre, some will do okay, and if one of two of 'em go up big time, you produce a fabulous result. And I think that's the promise to some people.","I've found that when the market's going down and you buy funds wisely, at some point in the future you will be happy.","In the summer of 1990, I was buying stocks and I was probably three or four months early there. But we had a great rally in 1991.","But my system for over 30 years has been this: When stocks are attractive, you buy them. Sure, they can go lower. I've bought stocks at $12 that went to $2, but then they later went to $30."],"Peter M. Brant":["Art and science have so much in common - the process of trial and error, finding something new and innovative, and to experiment and succeed in a breakthrough.","I identify with the 99 per cent.","I'm putting my consciousness towards trying to teach people through pictures and sculptures that there's something better in the world. That's what the world needs more of.","To understand Occupy Wall Street, you have to understand artists. Art is freedom - freedom of expression - and its message has resonated through society for centuries.","Art needs to be socialised, and you need a lot of context to understand that, and that doesn't mean having read a few art history books.","Great artists are like loaded guns. They are dangerous in anybody's hands.","I think one's character on the athletic field does not have to have anything to do with the way they are in real life.","If you have a vision and you are trying to accomplish something, you have to be competitive, or things are going to slip by you.","My whole life I've hated to lose, no doubt about it. I've been guilty of that since I was 6 years old, at camp. I have always played to win. That's who I am. But I never hurt anybody. The problem is when you're perceived as being too aggressive where you hurt somebody or do something improper.","There are people who say, 'Oh, he's a crook.' But I'm not a crook."],"Peter MacKay":["We have to stress our conservative credentials and emphasize that we are the natural, national alternative to the Liberals. Clearly the Alliance has shown it can't break out of its Western box. The Alliance is at single-digit support in three quarters of the country.","If the United States leads a multinational force into Iraq without United Nations backing, Canada should fight beside its neighbour. We've gone from being a middle power to a muddle power on this one.","What Canada has to do is to have a government connected to the priorities of the people of which it is elected to serve. Those priorities include ensuring medicare is sustainable, support for the military, and tax and justice systems that work.","I want to lead the Progressive Conservative Party, a party that will promote true conservative values and principles. I can tell you right now, I am not the merger candidate. I am not interested in institutional marriages with other parties.","We have to be focused on growing the party and getting young people to see us as a viable option.","I guess my natural inclination is to finish what I started. We have a Conservative government in Nova Scotia. What I want to see is a Conservative government in Ottawa.","It's not as if our party has a leadership campaign underway.","My gut tells me and continues to tell me that the Conservative party is on a road back to government.","I find happiness comes from numerous sources in my life. Most often, the happy moments I cherish most are quiet moments with my wife and family back home in Nova Scotia.","I'm a workaholic.","I feel guilty about spending so much time away from home and loved ones.","I was a crown attorney in my home town in Nova Scotia, and I learned that victims of crime needed better laws to better protect them. I saw politics as a means to improve this protection for them.","There is no more dangerous country in the world today than Pakistan.","You can't have a discussion about Israel and the region without including Iran and their nuclear ambitions."],"Peter MacNicol":["Acting is about covering up traces of who you are and just being the character. I think it's easier to accept people in roles if you don't know a lot about them.","I spent two years at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, and then some New York types saw me there as Benvolio in 'Romeo and Juliet.' They sent me some enticing letters - about why didn't I come to New York? - and since it was well below zero that winter in Minneapolis, it didn't take much to get me to leave.","The Guthrie Theater is a beast. It has 1,300 seats, and I couldn't act there. I always felt I was acting too small. I'd always have to fight to get the gumption to act bigger. There's a weird trick to it. You don't want to overwhelm the first six rows. You don't want to starve the back. I could never get it.","The hardest thing I do on stage is to self-induce amnesia. I want to go on every night and say, 'I've never sat in this chair. I've never been in this room.'"],"Peter Malkin":["Even a secret agent can't lie to a Jewish mother.","I spent a lot of time in churches. If you go to a synagogue, someone is always asking if you're alone, if you're married. In a church, in a hundred years no one would ask.","Many times I asked myself, 'Who is a painter in your own eyes?'","The problem here is with a human being, not with a monster, not with an animal. The human being does things that even the monster does not do, because the human is more sophisticated.","Writing and Painting are the same for me."],"Peter Mandelson":["Of course, the EU is not going to fall apart, but at best it will stagnate for the foreseeable future and we will be dealing with quite a lot of internal chaos.","I'm a fighter, not a quitter.","Instead of saying that globalization is a fact, that it's inevitable, we've also got to demonstrate that while the growing interdependence of the world economy is indeed a fact, it's not uncontrollable.","I think Europe is going in the right direction and we shouldn't be set back.","Having viewed Europe as an extension and projection of itself, France now finds Europe developing a mind and identity of its own which embraces France but is not controlled by France.","Too often we think we can act without explaining and take decisions without justifying them.","For too long, decisions have been taken behind closed doors - tablets of stone have simply been past down to people without bothering to involve people, listen to their views or give them information about what we are doing and why.","Europe has to address people's needs directly and reflect their priorities, not our own preoccupations.","What is most important for Europe is economic growth and jobs, security at home and safety in the world.","If the constitutional treaty is rejected it will be back to square one, just at a time when we want Europe to be a more effective force for good in the world, when we need to buttress ourselves against the pressures and insecurities of globalization.","The last thing we need is to turn in on ourselves rather than face us up to what we have to do in the world.","The markets don't like instability and they don't like uncertainty.","I'm optimistic that we are actually seeing the opportunity of a generation being created in this.","They want to derail peace because they want to plunge Northern Ireland back into armed conflict.","I hesitated, too, because for better or worse, I have been one of the principal architects of New Labour and I have worked closely with Tony Blair and the team for nearly 20 years.","Essentially we need a new social consensus for economic reform as New Labour has achieved in Britain.","It's a very good idea that we have a third term Labour government led by Tony Blair for a full term.","I do not share the half-in, half-out attitude to the EU of some in Britain. Britain's place is in Europe.","I certainly believe that we gain through open trade and liberalisation.","I have moved on from being a British parliamentarian, I have moved on from being a New Labour politician, I have moved on from being the supporter in the active day-to-day sense of Tony Blair.","I understand why the Tories will be gunning for Alastair Campbell because they fear his campaigning skills.","In my experience of these things, parties which shout about dirty tricks and the like tend to do so because they fear a direct hit in some vulnerable part of their political anatomy.","Firstly, people take for granted that the E.U. has created the biggest economic space in the world.","What we have to do is reinvent the idea of Europe.","We've got to demonstrate why European unity and integration, our vast single market, our single currency, equip us with the strength to embrace globalization.","In the space of a decade, China and India have emerged as dramatic, dynamic competitors.","I believe that if you treat China as an enemy, then it is likely to become one."],"Peter Marino":["If you want to come up with a really original design idea, and you want to capture a whole new design direction, perhaps the best way to arrive at that is not by acting and thinking and doing like everybody else. That's all.","I like more the fact that I like to think out of the box. Thinking out of the box goes along with dressing out of the box and living out of the box.","Design-wise, I look at everything. If I don't personally design it, I'll review it. I'm kind of creative director of the firm.","It's a good marriage because each of us is what we are, allows the other one to be themselves, and appreciates each other for the right reason. You know, it's rare that you'll find two people who don't try to change the other person and let everyone be what they are.","When I opened Chanel in London, they were happy. People would go, 'Oh, I just came in to see it. It's so beautiful.' And you leave with a positive attitude toward the brand. Now, you don't really get that online. You don't go, like, 'Wow.'","Publicity doesn't really get me anything. Clients are not going to hire me for a $100 million building because I have a brand. They really want the product.","I don't sell anything. So, I have a personal image, but I think that's because I'm from an art background, and I'm an artist, and I think most artists do have personal images. I consider myself more in that category of the way an artist had a look.","If I need a pair of tennis shorts, I'll buy them online. I don't really care. Not going to go and try on a pair and see how my bum looks. Who cares? But for things that you care about - I mean, a jacket and a pair of trousers, you've got to try them on.","I simply loathe the crude 1960s distinctions between commerce and art. For me, Warhol and pop obliterated all of those separations - that was the whole point of the Brillo Boxes and Campbell's Soup Cans. And believe it or not, in 2009, moronic journalists are still saying to me, 'Your work is so commercial.'","I loathe when architects only analyze architecture in intellectual, nonvisual ways. I really love direct response, and that's very pop. I don't want to discuss abstract transparencies with a bunch of kooks.","One of my first fashion clients was Calvin Klein. We did his first freestanding stores. He was very exact and precise. But talk about high-fashion people who brand themselves!","I don't talk about myself in the third person. When I start doing that, you'll know I'm having an out-of-body experience.","Anytime I see an unusual combination of colors or patterns or texture, I buy it.","I collect art like other people eat pizza. I can't get enough of it. I need a constant source of inspiration.","I always look for inspiration, and the creativity of artists is an essential element to my life, my work, and my happiness.","I work 12 hours a day, seven days a week - and I love it. I'm creative. I feel fulfilled. I'm from a solidly lower-middle-class background; I'm not from the world that I'm in now. So I appreciate it a lot. I've really got a rich, full life.","Architects have big egos. We like to think we're creating the pyramids and they're going to be around for thousands of years. And it's a joke because they're not even going to last our lifetime. I built a home for umpteen gazillion dollars on a gorgeous piece of property in Palm Beach, and 11 years later somebody else bought it and knocked it down.","In 1991, if someone came in with a $1 million budget for a boutique, I would have fainted. Nobody spent even half that. But now, the bar has risen very high.","All bronzes are made to be touched. Bronze is a sensual 'living' material. The sweat and oil of your palms adds to the patination.","Universal human characteristics are a good base for great art.","Creating work for the time that one lives in means no retro thinking. It can and hopefully does mean timelessness.","My parents spent a lot of money so I wouldn't sound like I came from Queens. I went to speech class.","Motorcycle garb is the way I looked to Warhol. Then came the Armani suits.","My name is on the door, and I care very much about the design that gets put out. I'm sorry, but it has to be my way. You learn that by working for people like I. M. Pei. You think he isn't a design tyrant? Is Calvin Klein a tyrant? When it came to his dresses, he had to be.","People in Shanghai make a lot more money than the farmers in the rice paddies. The rice-paddy farmers are not buying Louis Vuitton bags, but the upwardly mobile ones in Shanghai, who are all working in Wall Street-type firms, are infinitely better-dressed than people in the West. Their women take this fashion thing seriously.","My father's house was on East 55th Street on 1st and 2nd Avenues. I'm fifth-generation Marino in the East 50s - I live on 57th Street. I can't be more East 50s.","That was really the Fifties for me - that whole spirit of flicking the paint on the canvas.","I have this 'Alice in Wonderland' idea in my head that a garden should be a place of wonderment.","The French use gardens to show grandeur and the English to show how things have endured for hundreds of years, but for me, they're all about fantasy.","We have a thousand hydrangea plants bordering the house, and they were all supposed to be pink, but a handful of them keep turning purple.","I do really modern with materials that are so luxurious that they're, like, baroque.","If something's a high-margin product, I understand its importance to the store.","I believe that women would crawl across broken glass to get a cool pair of shoes.","Nine out of nine architects start with a sketch, and then they say, 'What should we make it out of?' I start from the bottom up - what should it be made out of - and then I worry about what should it look like. The material, the color of the material, the way it feels, and the way you respond to it is every bit as valid as the form or the shape.","I've benefited enormously from an arts education and a music education in New York. When they cut the programs for funding, I was devastated.","Ginza! Where I've done two Chanel towers and Louis Vuitton and Dior stores. I just feel at home there.","Koishikawa Korakuen Garden - one of Tokyo's oldest Japanese gardens, and one of the best spots for viewing the cherry blossoms.","The Peninsula - it's a combination of great service and good design.","Not enough people enjoy working with color, which delights and inspires me.","What frustrates me is florists who put everything at the same size on the table. I like it when there's mountains and valleys.","There's a very important aspect to all my work, now more than ever, which is tying the interior design and architecture with the art.","I want to be the first person to animate bags - everything done for handbags bores me to tears - I want to make it more playful.","I'm really a fighter against modernism equaling brutalism.","I am very happy working for my European brands. My legacy isn't going to be a museum. Yet I would be very good at it. It's so painful. It's like everything - the same old guys - Herzog & de Meuron, Frank Gehry, Renzo Piano - they don't pick original people.","I got into architecture via fine arts, and I was a sculptor myself, and I have always involved artists in my projects.

Will you make a chimney? Will you do something?'"],"Peter Marshall":["When we long for life without difficulties, remind us that oaks grow strong in contrary winds and diamonds are made under pressure.","The measure of life is not its duration, but its donation.","Small deeds done are better than great deeds planned.","If you don't stand for something you will fall for anything.","I know that no business contract, no order or commercial consideration can ever be worth the happiness of one's home or the peace of one's mind.","May we think of freedom, not as the right to do as we please, but as the opportunity to do what is right.","We ministers have undoubtedly failed to connect and apply Christianity to the practical everyday problems of the average man.

For the religion which He taught and revealed in His own life and ministry was an intensely practical and down-to-earth affair.","I am growing more and more aware that all too often we preachers aim at nothing and hit it.","God will not permit any troubles to come upon us, unless He has a specific plan by which great blessing can come out of the difficulty.","Give to us clear vision that we may know where to stand and what to stand for - because unless we stand for something, we shall fall for anything.","A different world cannot be built by indifferent people.","A man walks on through life - with the external call ringing in his ears but with no response stirring in his heart, and then suddenly, without any warning, the Spirit taps him on the shoulder. What happens? He turns 'round. The word 'repentance' means 'turning 'round.' He repents and believes and is saved.","Human nature must be changed if we are ever to have an end to war or to correct the wrong situations that make our lives uneasy and our hearts sore. Now Christianity, the power of Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit of God, is the only force that can change people for good.","Teach us, O Lord, the disciplines of patience, for to wait is often harder than to work.","This is a day of little faith - of few convictions - a day when men seem to have no great causes and no great passions. So in frustration, in disappointment, they are inclined to say, 'You can't change human nature.' It is true that we cannot change human nature. But God can.","Out of profound gratitude for my adopted country, I can only say that I would like in this land to live and die, and while I live to help other people as much as possible, believing that only in service to other people can I possibly express my gratitude for all that America has done for me.","Most of us know perfectly well what we ought to do; our trouble is that we do not want to do it.","If you hug to yourself any resentment against anybody else, you destroy the bridge by which God would come to you.","The true minister is in his pulpit not because he has chosen that profession as an easy means of livelihood, but because he could not help it, because he has obeyed an imperious summons that will not be denied.","God hasn't given up on you. He can still do great things for you, in you, and through you. God is ready and waiting and able.","Sometimes this going out in obedience to God's command is more dramatic than at other times... sometimes more spectacular... sometimes more brave... but always it is a venture into the unknown.","Lord, where we are wrong, make us willing to change; where we are right, make us easy to live with.","It is better to fail in a cause that will ultimately succeed than to succeed in a cause that will ultimately fail.","Church members in too many cases are like deep sea divers, encased in the suits designed for many fathoms deep, marching bravely to pull out plugs in bathtubs.","I could never describe it to anyone how I knew, but there was no mistaking it. One moment, I was walking along undecided - and the next moment, I knew that it was God's will for me to go to America. I don't think I could describe it any more accurately."],"Peter Matthiessen":["In nonfiction, you have that limitation, that constraint, of telling the truth.","I used to distinguish between my fiction and nonfiction in terms of superiority or inferiority.","When I'm in the field, when I'm working, I keep very careful notes. I wear big shirts with big breast pockets, and I carry in them two little spiral notebooks.","In fiction, you have a rough idea what's coming up next - sometimes you even make a little outline - but in fact you don't know. Each day is a whole new - and for me, a very invigorating - experience.","I was just very interested in the American frontier and the growth of capitalism - those enormous fortunes that were being made, more often than not, on the blood of poor people, black people, Indian people. They were the ones who paid very dearly for those great fortunes.","I think in any writing you're paying attention to detail.","Here I am, safely returned over those peaks from a journey far more beautiful and strange than anything I had hoped for or imagined - how is it that this safe return brings such regret?"],"Peter Maurer":["Conflicts are not temporary interruptions: they are structural, socio-economic catastrophes, and funding must be allocated accordingly.","There is a clear business case for building the resilience and capacity of local communities, businesses, and institutions because a peaceful, educated, and productive population will stimulate economic growth in the long term.","The Fourth Industrial Revolution does not just entail risks: it also brings solutions to humanitarian problems.","They say that truth is the first casualty of war. But there is another casualty as well: trust. As conflict escalates, trust between people and political leaders crumbles away as surely as night follows day.","Urbanisation, poverty, youth unemployment are leading to violence-prone cities.","Humanitarian assistance, once conceived as a short-term relief effort, is increasingly the only substitute for long-term development work in protracted armed conflicts.","Wars are getting longer, they are more complex, and the humanitarian need is great.","While the nature of warfare is changing and wars are moving into cities, they are also becoming longer and their consequences more impactful.","The fragility created by protracted conflicts, resulting in destroyed cities and dramatically insufficient services, is not something that humanitarian organizations can address comprehensively. Only political solutions can end armed conflicts.","Conflicts are increasingly causing devastation in densely populated urban centres rather than open battlefields, creating a host of new problems through the cumulative impact from the destruction of vital services like water and electricity.","Torture and other forms of cruel or humiliating treatment are an affront to humanity, and the physical and psychological scars can last a lifetime.","I have known Sepp Blatter, FIFA and football for a long time, and there are some fundamental values which FIFA and the ICRC share.","Cities tend to be representations of societies: diversity and inequality find their extremes in urban settings. Yet, when war is added onto pre-existing inequalities, high levels of poverty, or even disaster, urban fragility increases exponentially, making it harder to absorb the shocks of warfare.","I think we are challenged in how we define humanitarian action today and how we relate to long-term needs. We are also confronted with legitimate expectations from the people who want us to respond far more thoroughly to their basic pleas than we would have done in a much more contained form of conflict.","If you back out of a convention... you can't dodge your obligation. Torture is still not acceptable.","Experience shows that the reliance on illegal, immoral, and inhumane interrogation techniques is universally a very poor choice.","The International Committee of the Red Cross visits roughly half a million detainees in nearly 100 countries each year. It's our job to try to prevent and put an end to torture and ill-treatment.","Torture can destroy the social fabric of communities, degrade a society's institutions, and undermine the integrity of its political systems.","Where you are born, your parent's beliefs, or your ethnic background should not make you a target.","The young, the old, women, the disabled, the sick and the wounded are entitled to protection under international law. Too often, the ICRC's calls for those laws to be respected are ignored.","Trust into leadership evaporates with communities when they see that their problems are not adequately addressed, neither at the national level nor at the international arena.","Even in war, everyone deserves to be treated humanely.","Humanitarian action cannot be held hostage to political ends.","Since 1989, public alarm at the prospect of atomic Armageddon has quietened, but the number of nuclear-armed states has increased, arsenals are being modernized, and powerful states remain convinced that a nuclear security umbrella is vital to national defense, domestic prestige, and geopolitical clout.","It has always been clear that any use of nuclear weapons would have catastrophic humanitarian consequences.","Concrete steps are needed to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in military plans, doctrines, and policies.","Until the last nuclear weapon is eliminated, more must also be done to reduce the risk of a detonation. Nuclear-armed states should reduce the number of warheads on high alert and be clearer about the actions they are taking to prevent accidents.","Suffering does not change its face.","As conflicts last longer, as the scale of needs increase, we are having to adapt. There is an increasing blurring between immediate humanitarian assistance and long-term development needs.","Short-termism is no longer an option. We have to envisage humanitarian action with a medium- and long-term perspective.","Businesses operating in fragile or conflict-affected environments bear a responsibility to, at the very minimum, do no harm and avoid fuelling conflict or reinforcing fragility.","The humanitarian ecosystem is diverse - not only is there a variety of traditional humanitarian actors, but the system should also embrace an increasing diversity of private sector actors.","The creative capacity of the private sector should be harnessed to develop new and more effective ways to deliver humanitarian solutions.","Local businesses and communities must be included from the very start in developing solutions to fragility, violence, and conflict.","Fragility, violence, and conflict are complex. Fragility is influenced by a wide set of factors, many of which are deeply entrenched, such as high social and income inequality. The lines between criminal, inter-communal, and politically motivated violence are often blurred.","We must understand the factors that cause fragility, violence, and conflict in order to develop solutions that will meaningfully reduce instability at its roots rather than merely addressing the symptoms.","People living through armed conflicts need infrastructure and services which will last, and the last thing on their mind is which budget line applies.","To respond to people's needs, humanitarian action has evolved from a temporary fix to a long-term safety net.","The relatively unpredictable flow of funds to humanitarian organizations, and the bureaucratic strings often attached to them, can have a highly negative impact on an organization's ability to plan and execute programmes effectively. We need to be able to rely on predictable income flows to plan sustainable programmes.","Every year, we ask our donors to dig deeper. And every year, they gladly, generously comply. It is now up to us to find ways and means to forestall the day when they cannot - or will not. Or the consequences for people in war zones could be disastrous.","Economic activity can help repair war-torn societies, but if it's not conducted responsibly, it can also create or prolong violence. Companies and international organisations must help strengthen communities and overcome the trauma of violence.","New technologies are rapidly giving rise to unprecedented methods of warfare. Innovations that yesterday were science fiction could cause catastrophe tomorrow, including nanotechnologies, combat robots, and laser weapons.","Not only does disability impact individual health and well-being, it also leads to social and economic exclusion.","We need to continue to modernise current humanitarian work while at the same time drive a more systemic shift in how we envision the operation and financing of humanitarian solutions.","If private-sector capital can be harnessed for social good, the potential to scale humanitarian solutions is vast.","The issue of corruption in the humanitarian system is not an issue which is fundamentally different from dangers of corruption in other areas. One of the best ways to strengthen accountability is to engage in principled and law-based humanitarian action.","Ensuring the respect of international humanitarian law and principles is one of the key areas necessary to establish accountability chains.","Self-reliance is not always possible; we have to acknowledge that there are situations of dramatic crisis which will force us to substitute non-existing public delivery systems.","When millions of kids are missing out on school, delivering educational services becomes an issue that concerns the humanitarian system.","The whole essence of humanitarian work and the Geneva Convention is that neutral, impartial organisations can operate during war.","The ICRC did not see Nazi Germany for what it was. Instead, the organization maintained the illusion that the Third Reich was a 'regular partner,' a state that occasionally violates laws, not unlike any army during World War II, occasionally using illegal means and methods of warfare.","We cannot guarantee that a humanitarian catastrophe of the extent of the Holocaust will not happen again. On the contrary, we witness a catalogue of atrocities every day in wars across the globe.","The mess in the world is a strong driver because, at the end of the day, it's the increasing unacceptability of the divergences and rifts in the world economically, socially, politically, and culturally which lead everybody to say, 'We have to do something.'","We believe that settlement expansion policies pursued in recent decades by successive Israeli governments have facilitated the process of de-facto annexation. It has complicated the dialogue between the different communities.","It is very clear from the text of the Geneva Conventions that families have the right to know about the whereabouts of their missing and that belligerents have a duty to inform families if they have indication and if they are detaining people.","We live in an environment in which connectivity and cyberspace are transforming all workplaces, including the humanitarian workplace.","The discourse of sovereignty is a relative one when a crisis has become a global crisis.","There is great potential for investments that are built around improving social, environmental, and economic conditions.","We still have a strong commitment to our original mission, which is to protect and assist people who are suffering from the impact of violence, but the violence has changed its character, format, and pattern so that we are now responding year after year.","Each day that passes without kids being able to go to school is an enormous burden on the future.","While conflicts have expanded and deepened and transformed, actors have transformed, and humanitarian assistance is transforming. Protection work is transforming and taking on another character.","What the hell is happening to the world when those who were at the origin of... international humanitarian law start questioning in public debates whether it has any relevance or should be respected?","You don't torture people. You don't indiscriminately attack civilians. You protect as good as you can the impact of your warfare on women and children.","You treat detainees humanely because you know the other side will also treat detainees humanely.","It's one thing if a politician in a small country says a little bit of torturing is good to do. There is a qualitative difference... when it's a candidate to run a superpower.","The principal cause of suffering during humanitarian crises is insufficient respect of applicable rules of international humanitarian law.","Not enough countries, not enough armies, not enough armed groups are abiding by the fundamental human values enshrined in the Geneva Conventions.","In our fibre-optic world of tweets and tablets, we are more conscious of the world around us. The technicolour violence and humanitarian abuses of today are just a flick of a switch away. In our homes, on the train, in our coffee shops, we see it, we feel it, we know about it. All of us. All of the time. Human suffering is visible, constantly.","We need to understand that the Geneva Conventions are not just some historical documents born of another time, created for another purpose.","The sad fact is that horrendous human conflict is nothing new.","The abuse of civilians and combatants has existed since the dawn of time.","Attacks on health facilities, health workers, ambulances, is now a reality that we observe on the ground - not on a monthly but on a daily or weekly scale in most of the conflicts in which we are engaged.","Every day, we hear of civilians being killed and wounded in violation of the basic rules of international humanitarian law and with total impunity. Instability is spreading. Suffering is growing. No country can remain untouched.","We see a transformation of warfare from the big armies and battlefields in open spaces to a fragmentation of armed groups and smaller armies, which move into city centres, which increasingly become the theatre of warfare.","Cities are drivers of growth and wealth, and at the same time, cities are becoming increasingly violent.","Very often, development agencies or even some of the humanitarian actors choose the... more comfortable type of work, where it is safe, while the more important work has to be done where it is profoundly unsafe.","We demonize our enemies at our own peril.","The disconnect between what people think and what the political leaders are actually doing is something that we really need to start raising."],"Peter Max":["I never know what I'm going to put on the canvas. The canvas paints itself. I'm just the middleman.","If I didn't choose art, I would have become an astronomer.","All day long, I'm creative, and the second I get a little tired of any given medium, I just shut that area down and go to the next room. I just go do something else.","Angela King is a lovely person with a tremendous sense of art.","There's nothing like New Orleans. When it comes back, it will be a tremendous highlight for America.","The '60s were an amazing time.","I walked out with 14 advertising projects.","When I am in New York, you know, my studio is big, about 20,000 to 25,000 square feet, and I have painting rooms and rooms I do etching in, rooms I do lithographs.","I have 17 full-time archivists working for me who put away in books all the diversity of artwork I do, from drawing to etching to monotypes to prints to lithographs.","I kind of love my work. I really love the pieces I do."],"Peter Maxwell Davies":["You can't pander to your audience. You might in the short term, but ultimately you can't hoodwink them, either.","I'm very interested, for instance, in music in education - getting young people not only to listen to, but participate in the music that I write. I consider this one of the most vital aspects of my work.","If you don't get feedback from your performers and your audience, you're going to be working in a vacuum.","If you aim at anything lower that is expecting your audience to be really alert and aware, then you're going to be caught out sooner or later as a composer.","I recently did a piece for the Boston Pops and John Williams, and I hope that it's as well a composed piece as I've ever done for any other medium or occasion.","The demands are related to their questing of the best possible out of the people concerned. It's this going for the highest possible factor that I'm very concerned about.","You don't underestimate either players or audience in any circumstances.","What they can expect always is that they're going to be made to think.","I don't see how they can with most of my pieces, but I think it's unfortunate that they can through familiarity with flashy performances of a great deal of other music.","If you're writing a piece for the Boston Pops, the balance is towards one end. If you're writing a piece for a chamber music society, then it's towards another point. I won't make a final answer on that. I think it changes with every piece.","But you can't really know your audiences so well.","I'm obviously very keen on the theater and I think it's inevitable that some of the orchestral and chamber pieces have got dramatic elements which might even suggest an unspecified dramatic plot of some kind or other, even though it's not in my mind at the time.","I know what I want at least, and the older I get I think I'm better at getting it out of players and singers.","But when you get a bit older, and I hate to use the word, quite a bit more established, people take more notice and conducting becomes a great deal easier. You don't have battles like you had before.","I'm not actually teaching any more, but I am writing pieces for schools all the time, and for kids.","At the moment, in Britain we're facing such enormous cutbacks in education programs and music programs and art programs that you feel you are knocking your head against a brick wall.","The establishment in Britain is certainly against the arts and against education. If something doesn't make a profit, it's invalid, and art doesn't make a profit in that sense.","Recently I've been participating in radio and television talk programs doing broadcasts and conferences, and shooting my mouth off and really going to town.","The present government is very insistent that business sponsorship should replace government sponsorship of the arts. Business sponsorship won't happen unless you make tax concessions, which they won't.","An audience shouldn't listen with complacency."],"Peter Mayer":["When it comes to translation quality, it's not a question of accuracy but of nuance, especially in fiction. The prose has to read fluidly in fiction, and this is a completely different issue from literal accuracy.","It is always a gamble to agree to publish something one has not yet read oneself.","I'm happy as a book publisher. I loved my 19 years being a C.E.O. I loved it to distraction, but I couldn't do it till I'm 80.","Worthwhile books trouble our complacency, sharpening our minds and senses. Some are dangerous, and they, too, must be published.","I think the past need not be the dead past. If we get it right, with new books, the past can be a beacon for the future.","Penguin became less of a publisher for all different kinds of people and increasingly became the paperback publisher for the best-educated people, those people who shopped at bookstores. That proved perhaps not only to be rather elitist, but it also proved not to be good business.","If you're a serious publisher, you publish books because they work. In other words, they are written well; the reader identifies with the characters. The context seems to be real whether he's writing about the French Revolution or the failure of Lehman Brothers."],"Peter Mayhew":["I think that Star Wars revolutionized not only sci-fi movies, but also the entire industry in the way that things are done.","With my mask, I controlled all of the mouth movements with my own mouth.","They asked if I was interested in a role as a large alien in a movie.","I think the main thing was that the character couldn't speak in regular language, so he had to be mimed.","Never having played Chess before, it was most interesting to be playing the game with no pieces in front of me. But I still knew how to stroke my hair when I won.","I really enjoyed the last scene at the Ewok celebration after the battle.","Doing the Muppet Show you forget about conventional filming.","With Star Wars fans, there's so much enthusiasm, and it's a completely different generation now.","A whole new generation is looking at the videos, and going to the video shop and buying the re-release of the complete trilogy, which you can buy at a reasonable price.","But, apart from that, there was very little on underneath the suit.","When you consider that you're a character that doesn't speak, but you've still got to react to the other actors, you've got to make a noise of some kind.","After a while, the character sort of took over.","It was amazing that during rehearsals, without any of the costume on, the character was there complete. It just happened. Half the time, I didn't know I was doing it.","Richard Marquand, on Jedi, was very much an actor's director.","I think by that time I knew where Chewie was going, and he left me to do what was called for, because the character had been well established. You know, it was like putting on a second skin by that time.","When you've got eight or nine or ten cables running around with someone trying to operate them, it's too much.","George has only got to ring me. His imagination is so wonderful, I'd do any character he might create.","This has been the best thing that ever happened to me.","I can go out in public without being recognized. If I want to be recognized in public, it will happen.","George Lucas puts those types of characters in for the kids. Same with Jar Jar.","After my own for instance, my favourite is Princess Leia.","I think the things I wanted answered have been answered by people in the know that we can't talk about, so I'm perfectly happy with how Chewie came to be where he is and what is going on in Episode III."],"Peter Mayle":["One must never forget that life is unfair. But sometimes, with a bit of luck, this works in your favour.","There is nothing I like better at the end of a hot summer's day than taking a short walk around the garden. You can smell the heat coming up from the earth to meet the cooler night air.","I would dearly love to resist the temptation, if you can call it that, to worry. It's boring, it's anti-social, it's unproductive and it's depressing.","I was lucky enough to spend some of my school days in Barbados, where my father was working, and this gave me a taste for hot weather.","Sundays in France have a different atmosphere to other days, with fewer phone calls, no postman, no delivery men and no one banging on the door.","The funny thing in France is that writers are not allowed to retire, because the French government say you are still earning money from books you wrote 20 years ago.","I am a great believer in people taking control of their own lives.","You don't like it when a French housewife gets mad at you. If she gets steam behind her, she is an unstoppable creature.","It's very nice to meet the people who read my books.","In the south of France the phones cut in and out, the electricity isn't particularly reliable. I think many people would get very irritated with that life.","No matter what their background, the southern French are fascinated by food.","Nowadays, if you have a journey, albeit a simple one, you consider yourself lucky if nothing happens.","I left school at 16 and skipped university to work, initially as a waiter. I think I missed out on what would have been great years.","I have a robust sense of humour which helps me deal with problems.","When I was very young in London, I had a bank account, which didn't have a great deal in it. I should think at least every three months the bank manager would call me up and threaten to strangle me because I had no money, and I was writing checks.","There are plenty of miserable millionaires all over the place.","The great thing about having money is that you can actually just get on with your life and not have to think about paying the bills or crouch over 'The Wall Street Journal' or the 'Financial Times' and look at the stock figures and things like that. That bores me rigid.","I don't have a boss. Well, I have a boss: the public. If the public doesn't buy my books, I would be out of a job.","I have a very set routine. I work six days a week, but only half days. I work from 9 in the morning till 1 in the afternoon, without any interruptions, a fair slug.","Very little happens in my books."],"Peter McWilliams":["The road to positivity is strewn with the abandoned vehicles of the faint-hearted.","Do what you love and the necessary resources will follow.","The news media are, for the most part, the bringers of bad news... and it's not entirely the media's fault, bad news gets higher ratings and sells more papers than good news.","Be willing to be uncomfortable. Be comfortable being uncomfortable. It may get tough, but it's a small price to pay for living a dream.","To the degree we're not living our dreams, our comfort zone has more control of us than we have over ourselves.","Guilt is anger directed at ourselves - at what we did or did not do. Resentment is anger directed at others - at what they did or did not do.","Comfort zones are most often expanded through discomfort.","The media tends to report rumors, speculations, and projections as facts... How does the media do this? By quoting some 'expert'... you can always find some expert who will say something hopelessly hopeless about anything.","Life is not a struggle. It's a wiggle.","One of the great joys of life is creativity. Information goes in, gets shuffled about, and comes out in new and interesting ways.","To overcome a fear, here's all you have to do: realize the fear is there, and do the action you fear anyway.","I see nothing wrong with the human trait to desire. In fact, I consider it integral to our success mechanism. Becoming attached to what we desire is what causes the trouble. If you must have it in order to be happy, then you are denying the happiness of the here and now.","Learn to ask for what you want. The worst people can do is not give you what you ask for which is precisely where you were before you asked.","What's more important-your goal, or others' opinions of your goal?","To avoid situations in which you might make mistakes may be the biggest mistake of all.","In reality, serendipity accounts for one percent of the blessings we receive in life, work and love. The other 99 percent is due to our efforts.","Fear is something to be moved through, not something to be turned from.","If you're not actively involved in getting what you want, you don't really want it.","Definition of a victim: a person to whom life happens.","It's your life. Live it with people who are alive. It tends to be contagious.","We can consciously end our life almost anytime we choose. This ability is an endowment, like laughing and blushing, given to no other animal... in any given moment, by not exercising the option of suicide, we are choosing to live.","As the world gets dumber and dumber, I feel more and more at home.","We are all, right now, living the life we choose.","Nothing adventured, nothing attained.","Mistakes show us what we need to learn.","If you change the belief first, changing the action is easier.","Choosing what you want to do, and when to do it, is an act of creation.","Our thoughts create our reality - where we put our focus is the direction we tend to go.","While goals are chosen, a purpose is discovered. Our purpose is something we have been doing all along, and will continue to do, regardless of circumstances, until the day we die."],"Peter Medawar":["Today the world changes so quickly that in growing up we take leave not just of youth but of the world we were young in.","I cannot give any scientist of any age better advice than this: the intensity of a conviction that a hypothesis is true has no bearing over whether it is true or not."],"Peter Middlebrook":["The risks of piracy spreading beyond the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, off the Somali coast, and in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore and beyond are substantial.","Pirates are the very essence of profit maximising entrepreneurs described in neoclassical economics. Yet, whilst films such as 'The Pirates of the Caribbean' and 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' have gone a long way to popularise both pirates and outlaw behaviour, the truth of the matter is that piracy is illegal, and it kills.","In the long run, with profits from piracy greater than international finance mobilised to solve the problem, we can expect piracy to increase geographically and in sophistication."],"Peter Milligan":["I love Tike Alicar, The Anarchist. But I love Edie Sawyer, U-Go Girl, too. I was a little in love with her.","'The Names' is a story about a woman who might feel that she's in a kind of maze. She's unable to find her way forward or out because she can't see the whole picture.","Work changes over time, as you change and the world changes.","The DCU Constantine has to be the guy we know and love, with his same failings - otherwise what's the point of using him? But as I'm writing him, he's younger and has perhaps been through a bit less than the battered, aging old sod we meet in Vertigo.","Any team that has Shade as their leader is bound to have a pretty directionless quality. But when Cyborg asks Shade to gather the Secret Seven together and help him stop the war between Wonder Woman and Aquaman, Shade agrees - albeit reluctantly.","The first 'Bad Company' was a kind of reaction to the Vietnam war - or at least a reaction to how Vietnam had entered the cultural life through films and books.","One thing we never did with 'Bad Company' was talk down to our reader. And we certainly don't do that with the new story, 'Bad Company, First Casualties.'","There are some characters in 'The Names' who are very much heroes and others who can only be called villains. But generally, as we get to know them, we see most of the characters are, or at least become, quite nuanced.","'The Names' is planned as a nine-part series. I have a kind of road map: I know the final scene of episode nine. But as to exactly how we get there, what detours or horrible accidents we might have to pass through, I like to keep that a little fluid.","What 'Flashpoint' does is examine the inherent inconsistencies in Shade's past and attempt to explain it and give it some logic.","For DC, I'm working on the new 'Red Lanterns' and 'JLA Dark.' Both of these are very different books, which is great for me. I've heard 'JLA Dark' described as a team of people with supernatural powers - but that's only half the story.","'Red Lanterns' is obviously about rage, but more it's about how rage affects people - alien and human. I'll be getting into the characters of some of those insane Red Lanterns whom we've generally only seen spitting vomit in the background.","I'm working on a new creator-owned series for Vertigo called 'The Discipline.'","With 'Hollow Circus,' I used a family story that haunted me as a kid, one of those anecdotes about a family member that would rarely be spoken of in front of the children.","Charles Kiss is a legendary James Bond-style British spy. And McGrath is the young idealist who is given the task of following in his footsteps. It's a mission that forces McGrath to question everything he thought he believed in.","I'm continuing to write and love 'Hellblazer.' Also, I'm writing a 'Flashpoint' mini-series ' with art by George Perez - which features Shade the Changing Man and Enchantress.","Over at Marvel, I have a five-part series coming out very soon. The books or chapters will appear weekly. It's called '5 Ronin' and features some iconic Marvel heroes as you've never seen them.","'Greek Street' is a very strange beast. I think of it as 'The Long Good Friday' meets 'Agamemnon.' A way of using those fantastically rich stories from Greek tragedy to take a look at our world and to explore some of the things I think about this world.","I've always been interested in the Greek tragedies. A few years back, I re-read a translation of the 'The Oresteia,' and that stayed with me, and slowly this idea of using some of those old legends and plays to tell a new story about modern urban life began to form.","The amusing thing about 'X-Force' is that it was highly rated - and hated - in about equal measure, Which suited me just fine. If no-one's feathers were a little ruffled, we probably wouldn't have been doing our jobs right.","As our characters in our 'X-FORCE' began to push at the boundaries of what 'X-FORCE' was, it made perfect story sense for the team to change their name.","Since I began writing my new 'Bad Company' story, anyone who's connected with '2000 AD' has probably heard the sad news of the death of Brett Ewins, penciller and vital component of the original 'Bad Company' team.","Venom first made his appearance some years ago in a Spider-Man book, and was a huge best-seller."],"Peter Morgan":["Sometimes you are lucky enough to get offered things, and there is no rhyme or reason. I am very lucky because I come from England, and you have a whole range of things offered to you, from television plays and shows and theatre, so much more to explore, so it's never really money.","If you don't belong somewhere, that outsider status you have gives you perspective. Of course, another word for outsider is 'exile,' and that's not fun at all.","Everything I write, I've written the first draft in Austria.","For a younger generation to imagine a time where there was no security at airports - going around the world in the bar of a jumbo jet, 'Tell the plane to wait, I'm running late!' - there is something very Austin Powers about David Frost, a man who, in all seriousness, would approach women in a safari suit, with sideburns.","As a child, I grew up the son of German immigrant parents, so I grew up being teased and called 'Fritz' at school. When I married my wife and went to live in Vienna, I was teased for being a Brit.","I don't think of the crown as this glamorous thing. It's this murderous, bejeweled thing, the crown.","I'm not a vindictive person. But I do want to shine a light on human frailty and heroism in equal measure.","Self-destruction is such an interesting thing for a dramatist, and what's particular to Nixon is how human the failings were that led to his downfall.","The real beauty in my professional experience has been friendships and collaborations with filmmakers.","I wrote 'Hereafter' quickly and without mapping it out too much or being too schematic. As an exercise, I think that was incredibly important.","People test movies within an inch of their life so that the entire audience experience is a uniform one.","There are people who are bound journalistically to a code of ethics that means they can't quote something that isn't sourced, whereas what I do is entirely unsourced. I effectively fictionalise history and yet somehow aim at a greater truth.","You're either a person with a conscience, or you're not. I think I've got quite a fine conscience.","Generally, I read nonfiction. There's very little fiction that I enjoy enough to spend my time reading. I am generally a nonfiction guy.","I actually speak fluent German. And I live in Vienna, and I'm married to a Viennese woman.","Movies feel like work, and reading fiction feels like work, whereas reading nonfiction feels like pleasure.","The first and primary requirement for me in a director that I'd want to work with is: do they love writing, and do they love the collaboration process with writers?","I am not a politics wonk. I like the idea of my writing reflecting more about who I am or other people.","I have no directing ambition whatsoever. And as long as I meet filmmakers like Tom Hooper, Stephen Frears, and others who allow that collaboration, I can't see why I would ever want to direct.","I'm not an artist, and I want to take risks, and when the possibility of failure occurs, it's because the idea is all exciting or interesting as a high wire act, and sometimes you've got to fall off, just by virtue of the fact that you're constantly trying to evolve and do new things.","I'm not good at fantasy, no. I have been offered stuff, and I can't get my head around it.","I don't understand and don't enjoy sci-fi, and it's just that if people aren't real, and they don't live in a real and recognizable society, I don't understand what to do.","Once I start writing about somebody, I become very protective of them.","You can be far more challenging, articulate and intelligent writing for television than you can writing for the cinema.","It's madness to hand in a script to a director, leave them alone, and for the director not to want the writer there with rehearsals and the shoot.","If you have distance from the events, then your story can work as an analogy or parable rather than its literal narrative.","The minute you become a leader of a country, you go into a very small club. You join that sort of pantheon of other world leaders.","I watch drama on DVD because I can't stand ad breaks.","It was so interesting to discover Nixon was a Californian. I always think Nixon should come from a cold place.","I don't think I'm an unhappy person. It's just an intensity, not a depressive thing. It's just not having enough layers of skin. It's exhausting.","If you think about what you do, if you become self-conscious about it, you've got to be very careful. Because I really like to write without self-awareness of what I'm doing.","I'm quick to be upset. My feelings are close to the surface. There is not much gap between a thought and a feeling with me. It makes it difficult for some people. I feel too much.","I quite like the idea - just as an abstract idea - of 12 people's collective life experience and wisdom being this formidable thing. People say juries can be led - I think 12 people from different backgrounds, different races, different genders, different ages, it's hard to hoodwink.","There is something fantastically post-modern about David Frost.","I am drawn to characters so full of internal contradictions. Idi Amin was one. I loved writing him.","I have a great deal of compassion for those in public life and what we have done to them.","Ambition interests me because it's such a surefire indicator of damage.","I do have an innate understanding of where a story should or shouldn't go, in a way that I don't think can be taught.","There are many, many things in my work that need redoing - never the structure.","I think I stumbled upon a voice people associate with me with 'The Deal.'","The irony of what I do is that the more you reveal someone in their frailties and shortcomings, the more we feel drawn to them and forgiving we feel of them.","I've done a lot of work in Hollywood and theatre, but to be honest, the biggest pleasure I've ever got is from the TV single plays I've written. It's a format where you don't mind saying, 'I want to tackle some important themes head on.'","In a way, I think of the press as my colleagues. I don't want to throw hand grenades at people who do something that's pretty similar to what I do. But at the same time, we all need to take ourselves seriously and be responsible as professionals. And there was a collective failure in the treatment of Christopher Jefferies.","There is no inherent contradiction between being right-wing and being intelligent.","There were a couple of things I lost sleep over with the play 'Frost/Nixon,' so I went back and addressed them a bit more in the film.","Sometimes if biography is too head-on, it can feel too obvious.","Belief in God is so deranged that it makes absolutely no sense, but it holds people together somehow.","Authorised royal biographers are so straitjacketed, deferential, fawning, and unadventurous that they can only be after a knighthood. Or they're completely scurrilous and insolent, like Andrew Morton or Paul Burrell.","I insist to this day that if you read the screenplay to 'The Queen,' it leaves you in no doubt that we considered her an isolated, out-of-touch, cold, emotionally inaccessible, overprivileged, deluded woman, heading an institution that should immediately be dismantled in any free and fair society.","I don't want to become too self-conscious - it's why I never read reviews, even the good ones.","If you start to analyze what you do, it can paralyze you.","I'm very happy for others to engage in conjecture, but if I was ever conscious of what I'm thinking about when I'm writing, oh my God, I'd be totally lost.","I make a point of not reading reviews because of the old adage, if you read the good ones then you have to read the bad ones, and if you read the bad ones, you have to, you know... And also because it's a very, very bewildering and exposing thing.","By nature of the job, most actors are striking, remarkable, and alpha.","When I started writing the screenplay for 'The Queen,' about the aftermath of the death of Princess Diana, both Stephen Frears, the director, and Andy Harries, the producer, begged me not to put Tony Blair in it.","Nixon had lists upon lists upon lists. They were tragic lists saying, 'Smile more,' or, 'Be stronger - remember, it is your job to spiritually uplift the nation.' This understanding of his limitations is heartbreaking.","Truth is an illusory notion.","For 'Frost/Nixon,' everyone I spoke to told the story their way. Even people in the room tell different versions. There's no one truth about what happened in those interviews, so I feel very relaxed about bringing my imagination to the piece. God knows everyone else has.","People bang on all the time about whether what I've done is the truth or not. Well, to me, history is just a series of elaborate fictions.","I can't help slightly falling in love with every character I write about. And I quite like writing about people who are vilified.","Some of the things I have written about are a way of connecting with my father - I know he knew who Idi Amin was, and I know he knew who Longford was. And I know he knew who Nixon was, because shortly before he died, I talked to him about Watergate.","It is devastating, losing a parent. I don't really know what the effect is, but I suppose people might call me an ambitious man, and I'd say that an ambitious man is a damaged man.","The film 'The Queen' came about with a producer saying to me that he wanted me to write about the circumstances behind Diana's death. I think he was hoping that I would come up with some journalistic scoop that would identify an MI5 covert plot.","For 'Frost/Nixon,' I had eight people who were present at those interviews - they were all in the room - and when I interviewed each of them, they had a totally different narrative of events, to the degree where you thought, 'Were you all really in the same room?'","Every dramatist will tell you that they know deep down what happened in the course of making that film and to what degree they took steps that were convenient and to what degree they took steps in telling their story that were dishonest. You know in your heart of hearts.","Most historians are engaged in fiction.","As a dramatist, you have 200 choices at every fork in the road. But the audience will reject it if you make the wrong choice, if they feel you are trying to shape the character in a way that suits you. It rings false immediately. People can sense when you're being cynical or schematic.","My experience is, I do a table reading, and it's literally like it's written in colossal neon lights what's wrong with the screenplay.","It is a fairly serious thing that you're doing if you're writing about people who are still alive and who still have a role in public life. Sometimes you don't want to be reminded too much of the responsibility.","Most of the things I write, I write on spec. And because I write them on spec, there's less interference. Because there's less interference, they tend to be better.","I prefer my writing to do all the talking for me.","I can't imagine anyone thinking, 'Oh good, it's awards season!'","No family is complete without an embarrassing uncle.","It's important to me what the viewers think.","I just feel that if I'm English and writing about an American president, I have got to have someone on my side who can help me out when I'm lapsing into lazy or obvious European skepticism.","I can't relax when I'm watching a biographical drama because it's so close to what it is that I do that I just long for more fiction - so that I can switch off.","There are so many projects that I've written and had to abort because either I felt too distressed by what I was doing to the people who I was writing about, or they couldn't cope with it because their view of themselves was so far removed from reality.","I wrote a draft of 'Playboy' for Warner Brothers, and it was impossible to really be independent of Hugh Hefner. In the end, Hugh Hefner was unable to take the back seat required to be able to write something about him that I felt I could do.","I'm constantly having to check my conscience about what I'm writing and the responsibility of what I'm saying.","As a European from a different, younger generation, the trauma that was Nixon's presidency never really had a hold over me. For one thing, I never voted for him.","I have always cited the decision by director Stephen Frears to shoot 'Mrs. Henderson Presents' before my script of 'The Queen' as the reason for my taking the plunge as a playwright.","Barack Obama winning the election had an instant impact on everything - race relations, national self-esteem, tolerance. It also had an instant affect on 'Frost/Nixon.' At a stroke, instead of being a piece that reminded people of the agony they were in, it became an uplifting message about the agony they had escaped.","In some shape or form, we do have an emotional connection to our head of state, even if, for the most part, they seem very remote.","There's nothing wrong with anybody from any other country having a perspective on the British royal family. It would be interesting. But I just doubt that they would get the dialogue right.","Most leading actresses have this energy, this 'Look at me. Here I am.' They're powerful; they're beautiful.","You can't ask someone to act middle-aged. Someone has to bring their own fatigue to it.","The feelings we all have as 50-year-olds are different than the feelings we all have as 30-year-olds. That informs everything we do.","There's something about the soul of a country that is somehow connected to the head of state.","Sometimes it's okay for an audience not to understand everything that's going on.","As any showrunner will tell you, it is crushing work. It is around the clock. It is like a monastic commitment that you make.","As historians write more and more histories, it's a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy that other historians read their histories and then make synthesis, and certain things just get forgotten and left out and neglected.","Robert Bolt's storytelling is the kind that I grew up with and aspired to.","I'm not being presumptuous, I hope, when I say that 'The Crown' is little bit like 'The Godfather.' It is essentially about a family in power and survival.","In my peaceful moments, I yearn to write a bank heist like the one in 'Heat.'","The films of which I'm most proud I've written are the ones that pivot on forgiveness."],"Peter Morton":["When I founded the first Hard Rock, no one was serving American food in London; McDonald's wasn't there, Burger King, etc.","I can't cook a thing.","People come to my places to eat dinner with their friends, not with me."],"Peter Mullan":["There are some people who walk into a room and they oxygenate it, by their very being there's fresh air. Then there are those who come in with the smell of death and they suck the life out.","In the acting game, you spend a long time fighting against what the director perceives you to be. And half the time the directors don't know.","There's a part of bohemia I love. The lack of prejudice, the lack of aggression, I love the lack, for the most part, of competitiveness. It's more peaceful.","Sometimes you have to confront your demons and sometimes even let them loose to genuinely find a place where you can gain some understanding.","Every film I've ever worked on, and that includes 'Braveheart' and 'Trainspotting,' I've always witnessed a director having a breakdown. Every director will have a day, without exception, where they just can't do it anymore, they don't know what to say to their cameraman, their cast. It's the sign of real, physical exhaustion.","The Vatican is like a huge kind of magician's club. The more you look into it the more awful it becomes. And they're laughing at us. That's when I get angry.","In bringing the subject of religious oppression to a wider audience, I didn't just want to kick the Catholic Church but to poke a finger in the throat of theocracy and to let it be known that people shouldn't tolerate this anymore.","If you go into a bank or a shop and you want them to believe that you're going to shoot them, that's an acting exercise. If you want to turn to someone else who's as tooled up as you are and persuade them to put their knife down because you'll use your knife, that's an acting exercise. Nine out of 10 delinquents are frustrated actors.","Watching people just look out for themselves, I think, is extremely interesting. It goes right back to something like 'The Beggar's Opera' - the underbelly of society, how it operates, and how that reflects their so-called betters.","I know virtually no one of my age who can remember a hug, or a smile from their father, or a 'Let's go play football.'","Truth is I don't think God on a daily basis. I think politics, science.","If I'm at home on my own and the writing isn't going well, I clean my house. And there have been times in the past few years when my house has looked really clean.","You have to just go with your imagination, where your instinct takes you.","I find the world more absurd now than I did when I was a kid.","Part of the reason why so many actors lose the plot when they go over to America is that they become part of an industry, so that's why they don't want to play weak, bad or vulnerable guys - because that's not sellable; that diminishes their profit margin.","Part of the reason why movie bosses are so obsessed with crime movies is because they know that world and the criminals. And that's what they are - they would not hesitate to act illegally to achieve profit and gain.","Most actors I know come from a screwed up background, so it makes sense that if you can walk on to a space and recreate your reality, then that's the place that will become very dear.","I love acting. It's the one job I know of where you can go in, go through complete catharsis - emotionally, physically sometimes and mentally - and at the end of the day say, 'See you in the pub, guys.'","It's not so much that I want to direct but that I have to. When I write something it terrifies me that if I give it to someone else and it doesn't turn out as it could have done, I'd feel as if I'd orphaned my baby.","A lot of actors aren't particularly good directors. And they're not particularly good with other actors. That's kind of a fallacy.","I hate it when something is set in 1967 and every piece of furniture was made in 1967. No! If it's set in 1967, people have furniture given to them by their grandmother, which she bought in 1932!","What point is there to all the wealth and power that America may have if they can't look after its own?","In terms of popular cinema, 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' is as near perfection as I can think of.","I don't like the way some actors, when playing a nasty character, will try to grab hold of something good about them.","I did 'Deathly Hallows' so my kids could get on the 'Harry Potter' set. They met Daniel Radcliffe, who was a darling and couldn't have been nicer to them so I'm a hero right now.","If you are the kind of guy who draws in 100 million people to see his film, you've got every right to be paid accordingly, but I qualify as a character actor. I don't put a bum on a seat.","I wanted to dismantle the bollocks that there's a military structure to a gang, with a leader, second leader, the good looking one, first babe, second babe. It's far more arbitrary than that and their values shouldn't be romanticised. They aren't something you want to sign up to.","The working-class aspirations are worse now than when I was a kid - and it was pretty bad when I was a kid. Reality TV means they are being told they are no longer a working class, they're an underclass. Young lassies want to be Jordan or Jade, but very few aspire to be the next Germaine Greer.","When things are really painful, I turn it into comedy.","No hard guy's not scared when another hard guy's knife is coming at you. You're scared, obviously, but you've to act less scared than he is. It's who is going to act less scared.","Just in relation to women, it's not that huge an imaginative leap to see the connection between the Taliban and the Catholic Church.","As a dad I'm emotionally dedicated but I'm not 'figuring out their life plans'. But of course as I'm telling them about the rights of wrongs I'm thinking back to what I was like at their age.","The Vatican has tried to condemn 'The Magdalene Sisters' as a pack of lies and that I've made it all up - I wish I was that good a dramatist - and in terms of public relations, that was the daftest thing they ever did.","In Scotland, we're a colony in more ways than one. So when directors come up to work, there's a very particular way they want Scotland to look like and to behave like.","There's no such thing as an actor giving positive criticism to a director. The minute you say 'Don't you think it would look nicer...', that director's going to hate your guts. Particularly if it's a good idea.","A script is utterly useless in and of itself; it's only of any worth the minute your actors, your designers, your directors come into being.","The films that I really enjoy now are films that are made by, for wont of a better word, mavericks.","I'm not a huge kind of visual director. For me, it's all about the acting. There's no greater buzz than working with actors and seeing what they can do and how much they can improve on what you'd written. That will always be on the top of my list. It's a real privilege to see it live before anyone else sees it.","Life is much weirder than fiction; nothing's more absurd.","I guess I'm part of the art house, but we really have to shake up our ideas, because we're kind of self-parodying ourselves. We go places commercial cinema doesn't go, but sometimes it's to our own detriment.","I was on the set of 'Braveheart' and my mate says to me, 'Do you think this film will be any good?' And I really meant this, too, I told him 'Let me put it this way - It won't win any awards.' Cut to: five Oscars.","It takes a very strong brain to resist the absolutes, the myths that the media and the politicians peddle - the idea that if you are too kind, where does it all end? That not to help someone is somehow a good idea.","I'm not a career filmmaker. I just like to do things that I still kind of believe in and because of that you just never know what's going to happen next. It doesn't matter if it's been a good year or a bad year: next year, there's no telling what it will be like."],"Peter Munk":["For a Canadian, natural resources were a good fit.","I'm not exactly an Einstein, so I compensate by being more focused.","But you don't get into a business because of personal tastes.","Maybe I'm less sensitive to these issues because I see that what people need first is economic security, and only when they have that can they afford to focus on human rights.","To do so, we are creating a Fairness for Switzerland Committee that will not only disseminate some of the facts, but also protect a relationship that is important to all of us in North America."],"Peter Navarro":["My fellow economists and academics fail to understand the economics of trade in the real world. Traditional models of academia respect free trade without considering whether it is fair trade.","In a free market and in the absence of planning, developers will flatten every hillside, fill every canyon, obliterate every endangered species, and pave over every wetland they think they can make a buck on.","It's extraordinary to me - you cannot name a presidential candidate in history who has singlehandedly, through bad trade deals, destroyed more American jobs and more American factories than Hillary Clinton. She did NAFTA, she did China's entry into the World Trade Organization, she did the South Korean 2012 deal - every single one of those.","It's that evil twin part of me that always comes out at the absolute wrong political moment, like a demon possessing my soul; it exhibits itself as an arrogance or disdain or obnoxiousness or meanness or anger or pettiness - all traits that are lethal in politics.","The defining moment in American economic history is when Bill Clinton lobbied to get China into the World Trade Organization. It was the worst political and economic mistake in American history in the last 100 years.","For those of you who still believe in the Easter Bunny and that the letters that appear in your local newspaper come from concerned citizens who really care, I've got troubling news. At least in politics, most of the letters that get published on the letters-to-the-editor page originate in the campaign headquarters of the candidates.","We're already in a trade war with China. The problem is we've not been fighting back. Trump, through tariffs, wants to call a truce.","I teach MBAs. And I noticed, starting a few years after China joined the World Trade Organization, that a lot of my students were no longer employed. They were still coming to get their MBA, but they'd lost their jobs. And I started to ask questions why. And, at that point, all roads were leading to Beijing.","We prefer paychecks to welfare checks for the American people and a robust middle class with rising wages.","It does the American economy no long-term good to only keep the big box factories where we are now assembling 'American' products that are composed primarily of foreign components. We need to manufacture those components in a robust domestic supply chain that will spur job and wage growth.","I want consumers to connect the dots, to go to any store and look at the label and connect the dots between buying cheap China products, which is better for the wallet, and all the other things we lose, like jobs.","Let me say right off the bat that I'm not what you would call a 'tree hugger' or a 'bushes and bunnies' environmentalist out to save the planet or the whales - although I do not denigrate that perspective either, and I really like whales.","Al Gore has all of the positive attributes of Bill Clinton but is saddled with none of his negatives. He's a great big teddy bear of a political figure - Teflon coated, road tested, and everyone's nice guy.","My citizen activism is a direct outgrowth of a classical and fiscally conservative training in economics at Harvard. It is a perspective rooted in one of the most important concepts in economics - the need for government intervention in the presence of a market failure.","The last thing a Trump administration plans is a trade war. The issue simply is getting a decent trade deal with each of the major trading partners.","Would you rather have cheap, subsidized - illegally subsidized - goods dumped into the Wal-Mart and not have a job and not have your wages go up in 15 years, or would you like to pay a little bit more - not much - a little bit more, have a job, and have your wages going up? I think the American people are going to make that choice.","If you've been to China, you know there are over 100 cities in China, and the pollution levels are just horrific - 60,000 people a year die in Chinese factories and facilities because they don't have any safety regulations. It's a carnage; it's Dickensian.","Donald Trump is not a protectionist. If he imposes tariffs on China or any other country that cheats, all he wants to do is defend America against unfair trade practices.","The way the textbook works is you have gains from trade that should be distributed across all the trading partners. As soon as one bad actor like China massively cheats, they win at the expense of us; they win at the expense of Europe, and over time, it threatens the entire integrity of the global financial system and the global trading system.","We envision a more Germany-style economy, where 20 percent of our workforce is in manufacturing. And we're not talking about banging tin in the back room. We're talking about high technology across the board, whether it's computer chips or cars or anything in between.","It doesn't matter to me who's the most powerful or profitable country in the world. All countries want to be prosperous. What's happening is a zero-sum game between China and the U.S., where their gain is our loss.","Even though Mr. Trump is a billionaire, he is still able to relate to average working men and women. The billionaire gets along with the bricklayer.","In my life, I'm an expert on a few things. Losing close elections is one of them. Electric utility regulation is another. Neither is a barrel of laughs, but both have their moments.","A campaign is a complex organism that requires expensive parts. Finding the right parts and meshing them together into a cohesive working unit is an art in and of itself.","During a campaign, the trick is to spend no more than 15 to 30 seconds with anyone and to keep moving so that you not only shake a few hundred hands but also have a thousand people see you doing it.","I am of the school that believes, for the most part, that gays are born and not made. That is, I believe - and there appears to be significant scientific evidence to back me up - that there is a genetic predisposition to be gay.","It never was because of my positions or policies that people refused to vote for me. In fact, most people agreed with my policy agenda. Rather, the problem was my personality.","When you go to a political convention, the best place to spend time is at the numerous parties put on by lobbyists. And you don't go for food. You go to beg for money.","If there is one good thing I can say about the Republicans, it is that they are generally better than Democrats at putting the interests of their party above the interests of any one of its members.","I don't know why so many people in America hate Hillary Clinton; I found her to be one of the most gracious, intelligent, perceptive, and, yes, classy women I have ever met.","Never, ever cheat, especially yourself, even if you are absolutely, positively sure that you can get away with it.","Manufacturing is the seed corn for other jobs in the U.S.","The greatest compliment is I am accused of being a Dem leftie and a Republican righty. I am a pragmatist. I call it as I see it.","Politicians need money at election time and money to get the vote. Well, more than half of money in election comes from corporate interests whose interests are in polluting the Chinese environment and making products.","The biggest single thing China needs to do is build an emergent middle class and domestic consumption, and the best way to do that is through pension and health-care reform, and currency reform to establish purchasing power among its citizens.","The best way to lift people out of poverty and boost wages is to grow our GDP faster. While Trump is open to raising the minimum wage, the best approach is to grow faster.","If you study how Ronald Reagan won first the 1980 election and then in 1984, what Reagan did is what Trump is going to do, and that is pull in a tremendous amount of blue-collar workers who have felt abandoned by the Democrats.","A city should decide where it doesn't want to develop, saving at least some of the canyons and hillsides and wetlands from the bulldozer's blade.","Foreigners will eventually own so much of America that there will be nothing left to trade.","One of the goals of the Trump administration is to reclaim all of the supply chain and manufacturing capability that would otherwise exist if the playing field were level.","Trump will give you the robust bull: 25,000 on the Dow in the first term.","We're going right down the toilet, and it's a made-in-China toilet.","If money is the root of all evil, then China's manipulation of its currency, the yuan, is the tap root of everything wrong with the U.S.-China trade relationship.","The far more likely Trump scenario is this: Chinese leaders realize they no longer have a weak leader in the White House; China ceases its unfair trade practices. America's massive trade deficit with China comes peacefully and prosperously back into balance, and both the U.S. and Chinese economies benefit from trade.","The American people have been kicked in the teeth by unfair trade for decades.","We've got tremendous dumping of steel into our country and aluminum into our country - all manner of products being sold in our country at below cost, stealing American jobs or depressing wages.","One of the principles of the Trump administration is that we will never sacrifice our economy on the altar of foreign policy.","There's a natural antipathy on the part of the voters to a continuation of globalization as we know it. It's simply a code word today for bad trade deals that disadvantage the American people.","The basic problem is for a congressman or a president to get elected, they need obscene amounts of money. And the only place you can get obscene amounts of money is from Wall Street and the big corporations who benefit from shipping our jobs and our factories overseas - that's the fundamental political problem.","Cheap labor is a small part of the problem at work here. If it were only cheap labor, America would be in trouble. Because it's other things, too, we have a great chance to turn it around. Here's the problem: Our high corporate tax rate pushes our companies offshore. Our high regulatory burden pushes our companies offshore.","As time has gone by, I have looked more and more like Paul Revere than the alarmist my critics have sought to portray.","Here's the broader inconvenient truth for both Clinton and women's rights that Trump is more than willing to tell voters: Islam, as it is practiced in most countries around the world, suppresses women's rights - the only issue is the degree of severity of the repression."],"Peter Nivio Zarlenga":["The best mirror is an old friend.","Beauty is being in harmony with what you are.","The measure of a man is the way he bears up under misfortune.","In our factory, we make lipstick. In our advertising, we sell hope.","To come to be you must have a vision of Being, a Dream, a Purpose, a Principle. You will become what your vision is.","I know that no one can really stop me but myself and that really no one can help me but myself.","I am imagination. I can see what the eyes cannot see.

That will be the beginning.","No authority is higher than reality.","Divide your movements into easy-to-do sections. If you fail, divide again.","What is a lie? It is to say what is real is not real. It is to deny the existence of what exists.","It is hard to begin to move when you don't know where you are moving, how to move, or if you are going to get there.","First have being in your mind. Make real in your mind then bring that being into reality. The genius is he who sees what is not yet and causes it to come to be."],"Peter Noone":["I only went a year to high school. I should have been in high school, but I was in a band, and when you're successful doing that - well, you aren't too likely to go back.","I'm spoiled - in all ways. I've been in a rock 'n' roll band since I was 13, and we had incredible success. When it ended, it had been so good that I just looked at it as time to try something different.","What's really fun is seeing mothers bringing their daughters to the shows. And the best part is the mothers know they don't have to worry about sexual innuendo in the songs. The shows are family shows.","Everybody gets to a stage when it's time to move on. I was bored, and the band wasn't going anywhere, so I left. I did a couple of shows on Broadway and some other things. I was busy. I just wasn't making records.","There's an element of tongue-in-cheek in every one of our songs. Walking off into the sunset, holding hands, and being married forever was not exactly a brand new idea.","You never get tired of the buzz of touring.","I used to love the Beatles and the Stones and I'd always want to hang out with them, even though they were about seven years older.","Simon Cowell seems like a very nice guy, but I think he's a secondhand Mickie Most to be honest."],"Peter Nygard":["Stem cells are being used for anti-aging, and the University of Miami is doing a study about that to prove that it is true. They are looking at me, and my markers have shown exactly that I have been actually reversing my aging and getting younger. I am taking perhaps more stem-cell treatment than anybody else in the world.","I may be the only person in the world who has my own embryonic cells growing in a petri dish.","I knew nothing about the industry, I didn't go to fashion school, but I was brave enough to do things in a different way.","I actually ended up in fashion as opposed to sport because I needed the money. And it turned out that it tapped all my skills.","When I'm creating, that's my heaven. If I haven't designed something every day, it is a failed day - that's how much I love fashion.","If in sports you have a life cycle for 10 or 15 years, in fashion, you have no cycle; you're in it forever as long as you stay healthy. And I want to be in it forever.","I started stem cells when I wanted to find a cure for my mother, who I loved very much, and western medicine was not able to cure her. If I had discovered stem cells a year before, I think that she would still be here with me."],"Peter O'Toole":["Every three or four years, I'm hot again.","I woke up one morning to find I was famous. I bought a white Rolls-Royce and drove down Sunset Boulevard, wearing dark specs and a white suit, waving like the Queen Mum.","I will not be a common man. I will stir the smooth sands of monotony.","If I'm not at my study by 10:00, 10:30, forget it, I can't write a word.","When I'm doing theatre, I prefer to be doing cinema. When I'm doing cinema, I prefer to be doing theatre.","My plumbing is no one's business but my own.","My favorite food from my homeland is Guinness. My second choice in Guinness. My third choice - would have to be Guinness.","The only exercise I take is walking behind the coffins of friends who took exercise.","Acting is just being a man. Being human. Not forcing it.","Films were never in my budget. Didn't occur to me till much later. I hoped for a long, good life, which I've had and I'm having as an actor. I didn't expect the rest.","I'm the most gregarious of men and love good company, but never less alone when alone.","I put steam on the table by being an actor. That is how I live. The longer I live, the more expensive it becomes. So I do my work. And I can't be immensely picky. How many beautiful scripts come in one's lifetime? I have had more than anybody, practically.","If you can't do something willingly and joyfully, then don't do it.","Public crucifixion is no fun.","No one ever watched competitive swimming.","All the minor sports injuries you acquire over the years begin to multiply like flies when you get over 70.","It's my job, it's what I do, it's what I'm on earth to do and it's who I am.","The only thing I've ever been interested in teaching anyone in life is cricket.","I have no memories I'm prepared to share with you.","I love working with young people which to me is a big kick.","I loved doing My Favorite Year, which was great fun, and The Ruling Class, which I made with all my chums.","I tell my children to avoid theatre and go into cinema and TV.","I was apprehensive about bringing off this Homer.","I wouldn't mind being a lord.","I'm a working stiff, baby, just like everybody else.","It's very inconvenient because every time I finish, let's say, a chapter of a book, I think I'm going to ring Richard and then realize: Oh, Christ, I've buried him.

I knew after a little while that I could act.","My dear sir, it haunted me for the rest of my life.","My own favorite is something called Rogue Male.","The good parts are the people who don't make do.

He said to me on the very first day of shooting, Pete, this is the beginning of a great adventure.","We were in the Arabian Desert for nine months. And I was having the time of my life. It could have been an archeological expedition, a military expedition.","Where do I begin? I loved working with Kate Hepburn, which was one of the highlights of my life; Working with Richard Burton in Beckett was another great joy.","Writing is a kind of performing art, and I can't sit down to write unless I'm dressed. I don't mean dressed in a suit, but dressed well and comfortably and I have to be shaved and bathed.","For me, life has either been a wake or a wedding.","Irish women are always carrying water on their heads, and always carrying their husbands home from pubs. Such things are the greatest posture-builders in the world.","I can't stand light. I hate weather.","It is time for me to chuck in the sponge. To retire from films and stage. The heart for it has gone out of me: it won't come back.","My professional acting life, stage and screen, has brought me public support, emotional fulfillment and material comfort. It has brought me together with fine people, good companions with whom I've shared the inevitable lot of all actors: flops and hits.","I can make the best French toast.","The common denominator of all my friends is that they're dead.","Always a bridesmaid never a bride my foot!","Actors have to stay optimistic. The moment we start thinking otherwise, we're dead.","I've stopped acting, but I don't think I've finished using my voice. I could, and probably will, record the whole of Shakespeare's sonnets. They live at the side of my bed and are my constant companions.","When I work with young people, I grab energy from them by the handsful.","I love working with the young.","I'm not from the working class. I'm from the criminal class.","My father was a racetrack bookie.","I know nothing at all about women. They are an amazing, beautiful mystery.","I can now tell from the envelope whether or not it is a good script.","I take whatever good part comes along.","Money is always a pressure.","I have my very own Oscar now to be with me until death us do part.","I've played farce on the stage, but I have never played any sort of comedy on the screen.","If I'd known I was going to live this long, I would have taken better care of myself.","I have unqualified admiration for Brad Pitt.","I saw a man killed in front of my eyes just before my eighth birthday.","People talk about the '60s, but they were merely a mass production of what the '50s had begun.","I've done everything that's possible to be done.","I love London.","No one should ever know where conduct ends and acting begins. Conduct unbecoming. That's what acting is.","My dad went at 86. A car killed him. He was crossing the road.","I quite like being old.","I've never looked for women. When I was a teenager, perhaps.","I'm Irish. That means I'm Catholic. But, truth is, now I'm a retired Christian.","Right after I left drama school, I had a job.","In my day England, Scotland, Wales had 80 drama schools. There are none left. So there's no training, no discipline.","Actors have given up their clout. Now decision making is in the hands of lighting men, designers, bankers, special-effects people. We need to cut that out and just go with the most able trained actors in the business.","Omar Sharif and I spent nine months in the desert, day after day for nine months.","It's such a relief for me to sit in front of a tape recorder and not be using it to learn my lines.","I never found it easy to learn my lines. It was slog, slog, slog.","I had a son born to me when I was 50, and I thought, 'He needs someone to bowl to him.'","I suggest that an education and reading and facts aren't bad things on which to ponder a few notions.","No one can take Jesus away from me. There's no doubt there was a historical figure of tremendous importance, with enormous notions. Such as peace.","You know when you've found a part that you want to play. You know it because the part takes you over. It sits in the script waiting for you to play him.","A few years back I was asked if I would go and meet a director and his various acolytes, and it occurred to me halfway through the meeting that what I was doing was auditioning. And I thought, 'Well, hang on buddy. I've done half a century of this.'","An Oscar is a symbol that is known in every corner of the world.","It's a razor's edge, a romance with an old man and a young woman.","A rubber neck is a necessary part of equipment.","There's always a hunger, when you're young, to go from peak to peak and avoid the valleys.","I had a pretty hilariously gloomy few years in the '70s.","I'm not a French singer.","I'm not an actor, I'm a movie star.","Pope Paul III was the greatest thief in the history of the church.","There are only three indispensable things: the audience, the actor and the author.

Watson has given his quota to support the people.","Our situation here, without any exaggeration, is beyond description almost; it is such as eye has not seen nor ear heard, nor hath it ever entered into the heart of men to conceive Boston ever to arrive at.","You seem in England to be entirely ignorant of the temper of our people."],"Peter Orszag":["The fact of the matter is right now politicians and insurance companies are making decisions. We're saying we want doctors to be making decisions. And I think that will lead to a higher-quality, lower-cost system over time.","The most important thing for small businesses is getting the economy back on its feet. That - the key driver of small business activity is demand for their product, and that is what we are trying to do, getting the economy back on its feet. That's far more important than other factors.","There've been times where I wondered whether it was worth continuing in my own education.","For example, I was privileged to be working at the White House under the Clinton administration and had not finished my Ph.D., and I thought I was the cat's meow.","Every day is like that, eight successive meetings on eight different topics, every one really important and interesting.","My mom is a very warm, typical sort of Jewish-mother type. And my dad has a somewhat, um, different personality.","It is a foregone opportunity that we could have a trillion dollars more of income for the United States if we were producing at capacity rather than falling so far short of it.","Defense spending as a share of the economy dropped significantly during the early 1990s, and that was one of the things, along with other policy changes, that put us back on the path to a balanced budget.","I have young kids. The fiscal burden that will be imposed on them is going to depend primarily on whether we tackle this looming problem in our health care system - with rising costs that don't seem, by the way, to be necessarily associated with higher quality. That is the key burden that they will face.","Social Security faces a long-term actuarial deficit, yes.","Total borrowing has imploded. Private borrowing has collapsed. And, in effect, the Treasury Department is the last borrower left standing.","Well, a deficit reflects an imbalance between spending and revenue, and so narrowing it requires acting on one, the other or both.","Well, I think what we need to remember is that budget deficits can impede economic activity."],"Peter Pace":["I believe that homosexual acts between individuals are immoral and that we should not condone immoral acts. I do not believe that the Armed Forces of the United States are well served by a saying through our policies that it's OK to be immoral in any way.","Tell it like it is.","I have to use the word 'insurgent' because I can't think of a better word right now.","From 8,000 miles away... I would not judge a fellow soldier from a friendly nation and how they are employing their resources.","Intelligence we gathered at the time indicated that this was in fact leadership and we struck the leadership.","Marines are very good at fighting... And if Gen. Franks wants fighters on the ground and he puts Marines in, he'll have what he wants.","Surrender your forces and give yourselves and your troops the opportunity to be a part of Iraq's future and not a part of Iraq's past.","The bottom line is that after we defeat the armed forces of Iraq, that we will want to and need to provide stability throughout that country.","There has not yet been a major ground offensive battle... There are, we know, negotiations going on between the opposition forces and the Taliban leadership for surrender.","We prefer that the leaders of the Iraqi armed forces do the honorable thing; stop fighting for a regime that does not deserve your loyalty.","I can tell you categorically that any mal-treatment of any detainees by U.S. forces or coalition forces is totally unacceptable - that our orders have and will continue to be that we will treat everyone in our charge with - humanely and with respect.","Iraq and Afghanistan will, over time, become stable. But the War on Terror will continue long after Iraq and Afghanistan have had success in standing up their own governments.","Today's tactical victory does not guarantee tomorrow's strategic success."],"Peter Paul Rubens":["My talent is such that no undertaking, however vast in size... has ever surpassed my courage.","As to the 'St. Michael,' the subject is very fine, but very difficult, so I doubt that I shall find easily amongst my pupils one capable of carrying it out satisfactorily even after my own drawing. In any case, it will be necessary for me to touch it up carefully with my own hand."],"Peter Porter":["Love without sex is still the most efficient form of hell known to man.","I started off in England and very few people knew I was Australian. I mean, the clues were in the poems, but they didn't read them very carefully, and so for years and years I was considered completely part of the English poetry scene.","I wanted to take a stand against what I think was not so well established then but is thoroughly well established now, which is the substitution for a real sense of a country of a hideous distortion which you can sell to the people called 'heritage'.","You can never tell when an artist really will take up someone's work and work with it happily.","In other words the pictures are in a kind of relationship with each other which is touching only at points rather than pictures being illustrations of poems or poems extrapolations of the pictures.","As to whether the people who were supposedly to put up the money and did put it up or whether it was Arthur's own money is something which I shall never know.","I have no fondness for pure form at all."],"Peter R. Grant":["Thus the genetic basis to the origin of bird species is to be sought in the inheritance of adult traits that are subject to natural and sexual selection.","Islands are known to differ in the food supply available to ground finches, mainly seeds.","We observe closely related species in sympatry and infer how they evolved from a common ancestor.","Species can be recognized by their morphological characteristics and songs.","Thus mating of females was strictly along the lines of paternal song.","The independent role of morphology in mate choice is revealed by the rare instances where the usual association between song and morphology is disrupted.","To summarize, the particular song a male sings, and the behavioral responses of females to song and morphological signals, are not genetically inherited in a fixed manner but are determined by learning early in life.","Genes that underlie the capacity to receive, use and transmit information are the evolving properties.","Exchange of breeding individuals between two populations tends to homogenize their gene pools.","The divergence of songs in the new population away from those in the progenitor population would only be prevented if these processes were balanced by repeated immigration and subsequent breeding: song flow.","Plumage features constitute a major component of courtship signals.","Evidence of epistasis from hybridization studies is more scarce.","Males transmit signals in courtship through behavioral displays.","Almost nothing is known from hybridization studies about the inheritance of courtship behavior of females, or of their responsiveness to particular male signals.","Closely related species of birds are also chromosomally similar.","The theory of founder effects does not explain how novel features like plumage traits arise.","The process of speciation is completed with the cessation of genetic exchange."],"Peter Riegert":["You realize Shakespeare wasn't stuck for an idea when he said, 'All the world's a stage.'","As a matter of fact, part of being Jewish is the whole question of what it is to be a Jew.","It never occurs to me that acting with a superstar is something to worry about. I figure the bigger the better because more will be demanded of me.","It's a very neurotic time we live in, this postanalytical period where everybody goes to a shrink to solve their problems.","I think when you're younger, as an actor you have much more of a notion that you are doing something to the audience. But with experience, I think you begin to worry less about what the audience's experience is and concentrate on working with the other actors, and that tends to let the audience do more work.","Ease is something that I think many admire in other people, in sports or whatever it may be.","We don't think of them as acting, but we take on certain characteristics based on where we function, and those relationships draw out aspects of who we are as people. And that's what acting is. Different parts draw out different parts of your nature.","There are times when you have to fight for something you believe in, that you love.","I did 'Animal House' in 1978, then 'Local Hero' in 1983, and then in '88, 'Crossing Delancey.' And I realized that every three to five years, you need a big role to put you into the national psyche.","When you get older, unless you're a huge star, the parts become less and the competition becomes greater. Because the guys left standing are the best.","You have to have an ego to be an actor, but you need an ego just to get through life! Unless you want to sit on a corner and suck your thumb, it takes a healthy ego to get up in the morning and say, 'I deserve to be here.'","There are movies I've seen or books I've read that attach themselves in a way that's greater than the ability to understand why. How do you explain that kind of connectedness?","You rely on a lot of things about learning to play a particular character.","Obviously, any time you're closer in terms of what your knowledge is to a character, you can add something. But an actor's job is not to play only people he can identify with.","I did a play in high school, then one in college. My first professional experience was off-off-Broadway. I'm conveniently blocking the title. I'm sure I was terrible.","A movie is a filmed rehearsal in a way. The audience doesn't know that because you're taking out the things that don't work. There's no comparison to the theater because it's live. But making a movie is just as challenging and exciting, I find. A movie is pure process. The theater is the result of process.","I apply the three gag rule, which is if I can read a script without gagging more than three times, then maybe I can say yes to this job.","There is a temptation for an actor to editorialize what they're doing. And you can't do that with Pinter. It's almost like a musical score. His lines are so specific, but they can mean different things to different people, like an alternating current.","Sometimes you make a connection with a writer or a piece of material, and there's not much to ask.","I got to learn from the American audience. Hearing what it is they're not getting. These are audiences, 35 to 40, an older demographic that controls seven to 10 trillion dollars. And the producers and distributors have convinced themselves this group doesn't go to the movies.","In 2000, I realized I had reached that certain age when the parts get scarcer. So I decided to try my hand at directing.","I adapted an O. Henry short story called 'By Courier,' which got nominated for a Best Short Subject Oscar.","I've learned there is a void in adult stories across the land. Hollywood, whatever that is anymore, is losing their ability to tell those stories because they're not even thinking of that audience.","Setting a movie in an earlier age gives it a mythical quality.","In 1962, the smallest things were upsetting to authority. It wasn't the Civil Rights Movement. It wasn't the Anti-war Movement. It was something else, but it was a harbinger of what was to come.","I like Guinness, and that will make anyone Irish. That and soda bread, and I'm good to go."],"Peter Roskam":["Decisions are made by those who show up.","I thought I had a handle on my priorities before Elizabeth and I lost our oldest son to stillbirth.","My wife and kids are the constituents I will be serving long after my days in Springfield are a distant memory.","Republicans are listening to America's job creators and working to address their concerns with real solutions.","Small business owners are fighting every day to create and innovate, but continue to face government barriers to job creation.","Job creators should be able to focus on their work - not on Washington's busy-work.","Let's listen to the people and find common ground to remove barriers to job creation.","Everywhere we look, technology has changed our daily lives - from the way we pay our bills, to the way we buy plane tickets or keep in touch with friends and family.","Harnessing new communications technology offers one promising way to make public participation easier and more effective.","One of the best ways to stop the failed policies coming out of Congress is to bring in the ideas and the involvement of the American people, which the America Speaking Out project is designed to do.","Cutting edge technologies have allowed us to utilize coal's diverse potentials. Not only are we using coal in cleaner and more environmentally sound methods, but importantly, we can turn coal into gasoline and diesel.","Not only will the development of coal-to-liquid and environmentally friendly sequestration technologies increase our energy security, but these advancements will also help create better, higher-paying American jobs.","We must commit ourselves to an 'all of the above' energy approach, with a major focus on increasing domestic production and expanding alternatives fuels, while increasing efficiency and conservation standards.","More coal-to-liquid means more energy and a stronger economy."],"Peter S. Beagle":["Great heroes need great sorrows and burdens, or half their greatness goes unnoticed.","The horns came riding in like the rainbow masts of silver ships."],"Peter Sarsgaard":["If all the circumstances of acting are made to easy, then there's no grain of sand to make the pearl.","You want to do something, you want to have the bravery to do something original. And there will always be people who are like, the classicists who are like, 'No, but it's got to have this.' In life, there are people like that attached to every single thing that there is. These are the same people that are like, still playing vinyl.","But the way that we've got it organized in our family, we try not to work at the same time, so I'm just now starting to look around. I think I'd like to do a film.","If you go in and audition for roles rather than just be offered them, then you kind of get a chance to kind of discover that you can do something that you didn't think you could do.","I always think change is important in a character. The most dynamic choices that you can make for a character are always the best ones.","I don't really worry about being typecast much. I mean, everyone in Hollywood is typecast to a degree.","It is very possible that I could have ended up on 80 acres of land by myself, and fallen in love at a distance with a gorgeous woman I could never have been with.","The only way to silence a room that's laughing at you is to sort of take over.","Four hours of makeup, and then an hour to take it off. It's tiring. I go in, I get picked up at two-thirty in the morning, I get there at three. I wait four hours, go through it, ready to work at seven, work all day long for twelve hours, and get it taken off for an hours, go home and go to sleep, and do the same thing again.","I like anything that is like an obstruction, something that I have to act through is good."],"Peter Saul":["You never know about the art world because it's a matter of opinion. If you look at old art like Rembrandt and Vermeer, it's not completely a matter of opinion. The pictures confront you, and you see exactly what it is. In modern art, a lot of it is suggestive, and it becomes a matter of opinion.","The Pop art I wound up doing came to me purely from 'Mad' comics. I loved the idea of doing fun stuff. I met an art dealer who wanted to show the work - that was in January 1962 - and that was the beginning for me.","While in college, I used to get my ideas from photographs in 'National Geographic.' I started painting palm trees and motorboats.","I like to see things. I see a lot more art than I'd like to see. We have to be polite and see the art shows of people we know. We see a lot of art.","A mistake I've made is I have not worried sufficiently about the art world, really. I have not concerned myself with the other people in the art world. I've been a little too singular, and that's a mistake I've made. But everybody makes a mistake of some kind, and if that's my only mistake, I'm happy.","There's a small group of people always watching me to make sure I'm still offending.","I know it's a bit of an awful thing to say, but I really just make things up. My main goal is to make a picture that people find interesting to look at and that has my name on it.","I try to find a subject that is interesting to me and to the viewer both. If I can't, then I stop right there.","I enjoy finding a low subject and bringing it up high. I think with strong technique, you can glamorize certain things. You can make the imagery sharper, rounder, and basically better looking.","I'm aware of other artists, but what I'm really most interested in is viewing individual pictures. I like dramatic pictures.","I like it best when two ideas collide, like when you have a crazed attitude towards women combined with a crazed attitude towards the Vietnamese. I like that. Even if it's not true, I don't care whether it's true or false. I just do it.","I try to vote as left as I can. I hope that my paintings will coincide and be far left, but frequently... the painting rebels and goes fascist on me.","A lot of the things I do are obvious things that for some reason are not done. I could never figure this out. Why don't people do the obvious?","I celebrated success in the art world, which was quite sudden, and I suddenly had $1,000 a month, when formerly I had nothing, basically. So what we did with this money: we had a baby, we bought a car, and we celebrated by going to Rome, because it would be warmer and better looking.","Unfortunately, I haven't thought sufficiently about art. What I never realized - and it's really stupid - is the art world is the art world because all these thousands of famous and not-famous artists do things, over centuries. This hadn't occurred to me.","I'm into using acrylic, in a complicated kind of way: Making it just as good as oil paint - better, maybe. It's odd - when I started out, acrylic was for children, pretty much. It was a cheaper paint. It wasn't supposed to look very good or last very long.","When I was growing up, nothing unpleasant was shown in the home. And when I was in art school, the only art that was presented to me was Abstract Expressionism. But I was interested in the grim stuff. It seemed more exciting."],"Peter Schiff":["Trade deficits are OK under certain circumstance. 1. An emerging nation imports capital goods necessary to enhance its productivity. 2. A developed nation, with a current account surplus, uses some of its investment income to finance the purchases of additional consumer goods from abroad.","In a free market, businesses compete for customers by keeping prices down and for labor by keeping wages up.","Wall Street is in trouble because Main Street is broke.","To get great again, we need to recreate what made us great in the first place, and so we're going to have to let interest rates go up.","Gold has worked for thousands of years, but now with the Internet, it works even better.","The Fed is the biggest enemy of this economy. In fact, Ben Bernanke, as far as I'm concerned, he's public enemy No. 1. We're never going to have a recovery while this guy's in charge.","One day we're going to look back at $1,700 with nostalgia. People are going to be shocked at how inexpensive gold was when it could be snapped up for such a bargain price.","That's what's really bothering me about Trump is the hypocrisy, because when Trump was a candidate, and he got elected - because, by and large, he told the truth about the phony nature of the recovery.","At some point, the dollar has to give. You can't just keep printing money, and monetizing debt, and buying bonds, without the dollar imploding.","People should have an escape valve for their money, their assets. If you have substantial financial assets, the government is going to confiscate the purchasing power of those assets and spend it.","When the dollar collapses, it's not doing it in a vacuum. If the dollar loses value, it's doing so relative to some other currency. So the purchasing power that we lose, somebody else gets.","Gold has intrinsic value. The problem with the dollar is it has no intrinsic value. And if the Federal Reserve is going to spend trillions of them to buy up all these bad mortgages and all other kinds of bad debt, the dollar is going to lose all of its value. Gold will store its value, and you'll always be able to buy more food with your gold.","Greed is normally balanced by fear.","I don't want the technology of the 1950s, but I want the free market of the 1950s.","What got us out of the depression was capitalism, and we would have gotten out a lot quicker had the government not intervened.","The left-wing agenda wants us to think that the reason there was a depression was because the government didn't do anything. That's not true.","The government can't create jobs; they'll destroy jobs trying to do it. The government doesn't have any money; all they have is a printing press. We need to free markets to create jobs; if the government wants to help, they should reduce their burden on the economy.","My mother always taught me that two wrongs don't make a right. We shouldn't bail out Wall Street. We shouldn't bail out Detroit. It will cost the economy more than the cost of the bailout which is more than the politicians think. We'll run into the hundred of millions to prop these companies up.","You don't help the economy by spending money.","The American middle class used to be envy of the world. It was a byproduct of economic freedom. We had a very dynamic free-market economy and limited government. People were out there pursuing their own self-interest and creating employment opportunities.","We had a very upwardly mobile economy, and that peaked around the 1950s when the typical middle-class American family consisted of a father with a job and stay-at-home mom who took care of the kids.","The middle class today would be poor by the standards of the 1950s. Today, with two people working, they would still live paycheck to paycheck.","Remember 'The Brady Bunch' TV show? That 1970s family had a full-time live-in housekeeper called Alice. Mrs. Brady worked at the PTA and did community work. She didn't clean her own house. That was middle class. Now you have to be very rich to employ a housekeeper. Everything it meant to be middle class has changed dramatically.","When Trump was a candidate, he talked about the stock market, because, oh, the stock market was going up when Obama was president.","My investment advice is rooted in my understanding of economics.","The market needs to set prices, including interest rates and allocate resources. If it were up to me, we would abolish the Fed and return to the gold standard. Absent that, the Fed should be completely removed from the political sphere, its dual mandate replaced by a single mission to provide the nation with sound money.","There is no such thing as agflation. Rising commodity prices, or increases in any prices, do not cause inflation. Inflation is what causes prices to rise. Of course, in market economies, prices for individual goods and services rise and fall based on changes in supply and demand, but it is only through inflation that prices rise in aggregate.","I would say to people of a libertarian conservative position on an issue, do not do a taped interview. You're going to come out looking really bad. No matter what you say, no matter how eloquently you answer a question, your answer is not going to be what you said.","Every time the market has corrected, since 2008, it's always been the Fed that's made the bottom. The Fed has always saved the market either by cutting rates, launching QE, or threatening to launch another round of QE.","Wal-Mart creates entry level jobs for people who don't have a lot of skills; those jobs don't pay a lot.","The only thing I can do with my bitcoin is give it to somebody else.","Gold actually has properties - you can use gold for all sorts of things. People value gold for the metal. Nobody values bitcoin for the bitcoin; they value it because they believe that they can exchange it for something else.","The one place that bitcoins seem to be used as money is in crime."],"Peter Schuyler":["To be fair, lying is part and parcel of public life. Every politician has lied about something because they are owned by the special interest groups that finance their elections.","Could it be that all those reports coming from our own intelligence that Bush ignored was right all along? Could it be that the UN was right all along?","Until we totally change the way we elect our leaders, until we remove private money from public campaigns, lying will be the de facto method of governance in this country.","What is the first thing we did when we took control of Iraq? Protect the oil fields. Remember the administration quote about how the oil would pay for the war.","All around the world one heard or read that there was no connection between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda.","Even though the Bush campaign ad tells you that Afghanistan is a new democracy at the Olympics because of Bush's efforts, Afghanistan hasn't actually had an election.","Before and during the first phase of the war his administration repeatedly maligned the UN but now, that Iraq has turned into a quagmire, it is asking the UN for help.","Bush is a very poor impromptu speaker. He does fine in small groups but when speaking without a script in front of large groups or answering questions he wasn't prepped for, he has problems.","For some reason, it never crossed any mind in this administration to ask for the money back.","In and of itself, keeping the country safe for business is not a bad thing.","Politicians in this country have always been for sale. That is nothing new."],"Peter Scolari":["The reality of getting married, it really changed things into something beautiful. There was transformation.","I was offered some film roles, and I did not do them. It would have been interesting, but I have no regrets. I am where I am; I accept and embrace the mistakes because they're character-building and they build perspective and talent.","It's funny, because I was trained as a dramatic actor at New York's Colonnades Theater Lab in the '70s, along with Jeff Goldblum, Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman. People I worked with there saw a comedian in me. I'm still most at home in comedy.","About a year after 'Bosom Buddies,' I was suddenly a regular on 'Newhart,' and I was there almost seven years. And then, somewhere in the mid-1990s, I ended up doing a TV series version of 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.'","My mom and dad? Oh, they were a fiery pair. They stayed together for the kids and also because they were hopelessly in love with each other, but they were totally incompatible.","In a drama, you don't make a fool of yourself.","My mother sent me lithograph years ago at the height of my television success. It said, 'When your cup runneth over, watcheth out.' I never got over it. There's something so cosmic to be inferred in that. Not necessarily anything bad, and not necessarily anything good.","I made the varsity team as a freshman at 15. Then, I tore a tendon and never fully recovered. I was a shortstop, then third baseman, then second baseman.","I probably make more money in a year on 'Newhart' than 70 percent of your working top-name stars. Some weeks I just have six lines, but it doesn't bother me.","What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. I really believe that.","My first wife tried to get back with me a year later, but there was no way. I used to think she was the be-all and end-all, but I got my stinky little pride back.","I love Columbus Circle. I rebelled against the construction for a while because I go back to the '70s. There was no Time Warner building. Now I've started to really like it."],"Peter Scott":["I've always believed the greater danger is not aiming too high, but too low, settling for a bogey rather than shooting for an eagle.","I suppose I was very disappointed that I was injured during training for Korea. In fact, I had an argument with a grenade and it won, and consequently I was forced to come back to Australia for twelve months.","I don't think they knew very much about the war in Korea at all.","You'd go to a Pakistani party and the men and women would go in at the front door and the women would go to the right and the men would go to the left, and that was the last that we'd see of them until we were coming home.","Certainly the Australians were buried in Korea. But I think that from Vietnam on, all the killed were brought home to America or to Australia, in our case.","But it seemed to me that the American way of doing things was to obliterate a complete area, without really knowing exactly what was there and where they were.","The battalion, the whole battalion was affected by the two killed just within a week of being there, and I think that that pulled everybody up to make them realise that this was a very serious business.","They were all famous and fantastic fellows."],"Peter Segal":["I would love to see Steven Spielberg working. I just think he's the greatest living director.","I never put down a bad script and I never walk out of a bad movie because I'm always hopeful things will change.","I'm very spiritual and I'm Jewish by faith. I'm not a practising Jew, I'm more of a recreational Jew. I celebrate the holidays and I try to inform my kids about their heritage because I think we all at some point have to defend our heritage and if they get picked on I want them to know why.","Some people are like cats - if they're dropped upside down, they land on their feet. I get a little irritated about stories like that.","I kind of don't like doing film commentaries because I think they're kind of weird.","The rules I go by are: Always keep your villains bad, and keep the plot grounded and real. If you keep those stakes, the comedy will bounce off that and work.","I think superheroes are heroes with flaws, and in their flaws, there is a sense of humor."],"Peter Sellers":["There is no me. I do not exist. There used to be a me but I had it surgically removed.","I'm a classic example of all humorists - only funny when I'm working.","Conversation like television set on honeymoon... unnecessary.","Finally, in conclusion, let me say just this.","Women are more difficult to handle than men. It's their minds.","To see me as a person on screen would be one of the dullest experiences you could ever wish to experience.","If you ask me to play myself, I will not know what to do. I do not know who or what I am.","I feel ghostly unreal until I become somebody else again on the screen."],"Peter Senge":["The further human society drifts away from nature, the less we understand interdependence.","Most leadership strategies are doomed to failure from the outset. As people have been noting for years, the majority of strategic initiatives that are driven from the top are marginally effective - at best.","Innovation requires resources to invest, and you can see many companies pulling back and going into an intense protective mode in a major extended period of financial distress.","Most leadership strategies are doomed to failure from the outset.","I'm really interested in how you create a whole new economy of recycling. It's literally the 'underground economy.' All this stuff that on the surface creates growth and profit, ends up with waste, junk, and CO2. So how do you make it economic to bring new players into the ball game?","In the Machine Age, the company itself became a machine - a machine for making money.","The company-as-a-machine model fits how people think about and operate conventional companies. And, of course, it fits how people think about changing conventional companies: You have a broken company, and you need to change it, to fix it.","The Industrial Age is not sustainable. It's not sustainable in ecological terms, and it's not sustainable in human terms.","If you are realistic about how our present society works, the economic clout - and a lot of the political clout, frankly - is in the business sector. And it's the locus of innovation.","Governments, especially democratic ones, are short-term and nationalistic.","Nobody likes to throw stuff away. It's just antithetical to our sense of being a person. But we're all habituated to that way of living today.","There's a lot of American kids think their food comes from the grocery store and the concept of seasonality has no meaning to them whatsoever.","Business has a way of talking about how to create value, which is in some way isn't bad... We just need to start thinking about if the value we want to create is consistent with all social and environmental well being.","One industrial age belief is that GDP or GNP is a measure of progress. I don't care if you're the President of China or the U.S., if your country doesn't grow, you're in trouble. But we all know that beyond a certain level of material need, further material acquisition doesn't make people happier.","How do you know what people value? Well, you watch what they buy. How do we know what products to create? Well, it's based on what they value.","You go to any MBA program, and you will be taught the theory of the firm, that the purpose of the firm is the maximization of return on invested capital. I always thought this was a kind of lunacy.","A well-managed business will have a high return on invested capital. But that's a consequence. It's not a way to manage a business.","The most universal challenge that we face is the transition from seeing our human institutions as machines to seeing them as embodiments of nature.","In our ordinary experiences with other people, we know that approaching each other in a machinelike way gets us into trouble."],"Peter Serafinowicz":["I don't think anybody would be interested in my memoir - and my memory isn't very good either!","The thing with stand-up is, I really enjoyed it, but I kind of loathed it as well. It makes me feel physically sick.","The only way to get better at stand-up is to do loads of gigs, and I don't know. I spread myself pretty thin to get the stage time. I'd love to do more, really.","Through Twitter, I've got a writing career and a directing career, as well as hundreds of other beneficial things that have happened to me. I love it.","Twitter taught me how to become better at writing jokes because it forces you to chip away at all the extraneous words."],"Peter Shaffer":["Tragedy, for me, is not a conflict between right and wrong, but between two different kinds of right.","The rhetoric is the key to the character. It's the verbal music of the piece.","Everything we feel is made of Time. All the beauties of life are shaped by it.","And in fact, I think one of the best guides to telling you who you are, and I think children use it all the time for this purpose, is fantasy.","Watching Italian opera, all those male sopranos screeching, stupid fat couples rolling their eyes about. That's not love, it's just rubbish.","I've seen the most remarkable thing. It's in the New York Public Library. They've got the original typescript of 'The Importance of Being Earnest' - all four acts of it.","If London is a watercolor, New York is an oil painting.","Our function as playwrights to some extent is to make audiences see with their ears, because films make us see with our eyes much better.","Art and literature are my surrogate religions.","In London, 'Equus' caused a sensation because it displayed cruelty to horses; in New York, because it allegedly displayed cruelty to psychiatrists.","Passion, you see, can be destroyed by a doctor. It cannot be created.","Rehearsing a play is making the word flesh. Publishing a play is reversing the process.","Black Comedy is a farce that is played in the dark, as you know, with the lights full on. It's the Chinese convention of reversing light and dark, and exactly where anybody is at any given moment is the play.","But the first published thing I did was a detective story, detective novel, and I did that on my own.","I made, over the years in Cambridge, several very good American friends, and America appeared to me, a land of promise in every sense of that word, a land of freedom from the inhibitions and restrictions that I felt in England.","I really believe that studying organization, even in the form of studying detective story organization, is very, very valuable for a playwright, a budding playwright.","I think I did have fantasies about being an actor. In fact, I know I did.","I think people nowadays do tend to blame their parents for everything.","I think plays, like books, are endemic. They grow out of the soil of the writer and the place he's writing about. I think, you just can't move them about, you know.","I think possibly the first film that has music as its leading character.","I was an accomplice in my own frustration.","I was born in Liverpool in England, and I lived there for the first nine years of my life.","It is very, very difficult for a playwright to write a scene in which a young man has his first deep experience of sex with a girl whom he found immensely attractive, is fully satisfied by this event and gets up and blinds a lot of horses.","It's an extraordinary thing about Mozart is that you never tire of him... he never bores me, and he doesn't... not only bore me, that's too strong a word.","Librarians as a race tend to be tedious.","My actual childhood, as opposed to my adolescence, was not spent in London.","They look so expectant, and then they look so depressed... that was the other great lesson that The Royal Hunt of the Sun taught me, it was the profundity that masked drama can achieve, that of course, the audience were not seeing masks moving at all.","We... our war began September the 3rd 1939, with the invasion of Poland by Germany, and thereafter the great state of danger in England at that time, with the bombings, necessitated the evacuation of children.","You can't always let people do their own thing.","You never quite know what's going to strike your imagination, or something that won't going to leave you alone, not going to leave alone, and this was one for me.","I discover what I mean as I write. That can be both terrifically exciting and very dangerous, because when you look at your words later, you wonder, 'Did I really mean that, or am I just making verbal patterns?'","I'd be willing to bet that any incursion throughout history in which the invading country has proclaimed it is bringing benefits to the conquered is based on a lie.","I was brought up in an Orthodox Jewish household. I don't think I ever had a single discussion with my parents about faith. It was just something gently imposed.","A part of me is always envious of people who live in the present and are sustained by a sense of spontaneity. Even dogs have that capacity: they're always wanting to participate in something, and I don't often have that element in me.","The conquistadors and their followers were very rough people, and they were fixated on gold and silver. They were oblivious to the astonishing achievements of the Inca civilisation.","There used to be a certain condescension to Mozart. His music was regarded as pleasant. He was a porcelain figure playing a porcelain harpsichord.","Things rust, you know, like the heart. My cardiologist said, 'It's a pump; use it - that's the sole advice I've got to give you.' It's the same in playwriting. Don't theorise about it. Do it."],"Peter Shilton":["As a goalkeeper you need to be good at organising the people in front of you and motivating them. You need to see what's going on and react to the threats. Just like a good manager in business.","I prefer more spicy food to your Italian to be fair.","The money is in a different league these days, of course, but I have special memories of the 60s and 70s which players today don't have. There wasn't the same celebrity attitude and media exposure. We had a bit more freedom.","To play in the World Cup and try to win something for England was the ultimate.","If you stand still there is only one way to go, and that's backwards.","Being fit will keep you mentally sharp and people forget that.","I'm still very professional about my fitness. I stay in trim as I always did.","I played for 30 years, 20 with England and I did it by setting goals.","Revie said there was nothing between me and Ray yet he never gave me a chance to show what I could do.","There are similarities between business and sport, in the pressures involved and in the fitness aspect too.","There have always been card schools at football clubs and always will be.","You can never turn the clock back and, since we're talking about mental health, I would stress that.","I don't take a lot of notice of odds.","I mean no disrespect to Scottish football, but the Premier League is the biggest stage and highest profile league of all.","When you talk about obesity, there's so many things that can cause that. It can be a medical thing, or down to the individual. There's a lot of other things involved than eating a Mars bar.","I'm not a big music fan. Well, I am a big fan, but I'm not the type of person who buys stuff."],"Peter Shumlin":["You've got to remember, Vermont is a lot of beautiful mountains with valleys and small brooks that run into bigger rivers.","Single payer means something different to everyone. The way I define it is that health care is a right and not a privilege.","I suspect I'm the only politician in America who won an election in this last cycle with TV ads saying I was going to try to pass the first single-payer system in America.","Where health care has failed is in designing a cost containment mechanism that works."],"Peter Singer":["Of all the arguments against voluntary euthanasia, the most influential is the 'slippery slope': once we allow doctors to kill patients, we will not be able to limit the killing to those who want to die.","It was wrong to capture wild animals and confine them in captivity for people to go and gawk at them. And that's basically how zoos got started. But once you do that, and once you have animals that have been bred in captivity, you're really stuck with them in some sense. You can't return them to the wild.","Diamonds have an image of purity and light. They are given as a pledge of love and worn as a symbol of commitment.","My own view is that being a vegetarian or vegan is not an end in itself, but a means towards reducing both human and animal suffering and leaving a habitable planet to future generations.","Attempts to defend amusement parks and circuses on the grounds that they 'educate' people about animals should not be taken seriously. Such enterprises are part of the commercial entertainment industry. The most important lesson they teach impressionable young minds is that it is acceptable to keep animals in captivity for human amusement.","All I say about severely disabled babies is that when a life is so miserable it is not worth living, then it is permissible to give it a lethal injection. These are decisions that should be taken by parents - never the state - in consultation with their doctors.","The new freedom of expression brought by the Internet goes far beyond politics. People relate to each other in new ways, posing questions about how we should respond to people when all that we know about them is what we have learned through a medium that permits all kinds of anonymity and deception.","Of those who die from avoidable, poverty-related causes, nearly 10 million, according to UNICEF, are children under five. They die from diseases such as measles, diarrhoea, and malaria that are easy and inexpensive to treat or prevent.","Knowing that we can control our own behaviour makes it more likely that we will.","The notion that human life is sacred just because it is human life is medieval.","When I was a child, my father used to take me for walks, often along a river or by the sea. We would pass people fishing, perhaps reeling in their lines with struggling fish hooked at the end of them. Once I saw a man take a small fish out of a bucket and impale it, still wriggling, on an empty hook to use as bait.","I think ethics is always there; it's not always a very thoughtful or reflective ethics.","We need to recognise that what really matters isn't buying more and more consumer goods, but family, friends, and knowing that we are doing something worthwhile with our lives. Helping to reduce the appalling consequences of world poverty should be part of that reassessment.","The Internet, like the steam engine, is a technological breakthrough that changed the world.","You shouldn't say 'animals' to distinguish between humans and non-humans. We are all animals.","In an ideal world, the amount of money we spend on medical research to prevent or cure a disease would be proportional to its seriousness and the number of people who suffer from it.","Without in any way minimising the economic and psychological blow that people experience when they lose their jobs, the unemployed in affluent countries still have a safety net, in the form of social security payments, and usually free healthcare and free education for their children. They also have sanitation and safe drinking water.","Several countries - among them Austria, Costa Rica, Denmark, Finland, India, Israel and Sweden - ban or severely restrict the use of wild animals in circuses. In Brazil, a movement to ban wild animals from circuses started after hungry lions managed to grab and devour a small boy.","There is no excuse for keeping wild animals in amusement parks or circuses. Until our governments take action, we should avoid supporting places where captive wild animals perform for our amusement. If the public will not pay to see them, the businesses that profit from keeping animals captive will not be able to continue.","I don't think nationalism is alone holding the field; it's in contention with a lot of different things.","The price we are willing to pay for safety cannot be infinite. It is distasteful to put a price on human life, but the more we spend on safety, the less we will have for our other goals.","Dolphins are social mammals, capable of enjoying their lives. They form close bonds with other members of their group.","I don't eat meat. I've been a vegetarian since 1971. I've gradually become increasingly vegan. I am largely vegan, but I'm a flexible vegan. I don't go to the supermarket and buy non-vegan stuff for myself. But when I'm traveling or going to other people's places, I will be quite happy to eat vegetarian rather than vegan.","When fish experience something that would cause other animals physical pain, they behave in ways suggestive of pain, and the change in behaviour may last several hours.","I find it extraordinary that anyone would have an intellectual conversion to Roman Catholicism.","If people are prepared to eat locally and seasonally, then they probably do pretty well in terms of environmental impact.","To be a utilitarian means that you judge actions as right or wrong in accordance with whether they have good consequences. So you try to do what will have the best consequences for all of those affected.","I am not saying that factory farming is the same as the Holocaust or the slave trade, but it's clear that there is an immense amount of suffering in it, and just as we think that the Nazis were wrong to ignore the suffering of their victims, so we are wrong to ignore the sufferings of our victims.","Of those who die from avoidable, poverty-related causes, nearly 10 million, according to UNICEF, are children under five. They die from diseases such as measles, diarrhea, and malaria that are easy and inexpensive to treat or prevent.","More often there's a compromise between ethics and expediency.","I believe that in this new world that we live in, we often have a responsibility, you know, to actually go beyond the thou shalt nots - that is, the not harming others - and say we can help others and we should be helping others.","Can we really believe that we are living a good life, an ethically decent life if we don't do anything serious to help reduce poverty around the world and help save the lives of children or adults who are likely to die if we don't increase the amount of aid we are giving.","In the real world, 90% of the money spent on medical research is focused on conditions that are responsible for just 10% of the deaths and disability caused by diseases globally.","An animal experiment cannot be justifiable unless the experiment is so important that the use of a brain-damaged human would be justifiable.","If you're buying animal products and can go to the farm and actually see how the animals are looked after, yes, that's an important point. That's definitely the best way of assuring yourself that the animals are being well treated.","That's a central part of philosophy, of ethics. What do I owe to strangers? What do I owe to my family? What is it to live a good life? Those are questions which we face as individuals.","Every profession will have its rogues, of course, no matter what oaths are sworn, but many health care professionals have a real commitment to serving the best interests of their clients.","Animals, or at least those who are conscious and capable of suffering or enjoying their lives, are not things for us to use in whatever way we find convenient.","All the arguments to prove man's superiority cannot shatter this hard fact: in suffering the animals are our equals.","It's because I work in ethics, and, more specifically, applied ethics, that I think it's important that if you have things to say that you think are right and you think could make the world a better place, it's important that many people read about them.","Human decision-making is complex. On our own, our tendency to yield to short-term temptations, and even to addictions, may be too strong for our rational, long-term planning.","I don't understand the notion that modern farming is anything do to with nature. It's a pretty gross interference with nature.","I can tell you that too much money is corrupting American politics. Don't blame the American public. The U.S. Supreme Court has a lot to answer for, because it has made it impossible for Congress to reduce the corrupting influence of money on American political life.","I have never really been fond of animals. I certainly wasn't an 'animal lover' when I became involved in the movement. I just came to be persuaded that animals should be treated as independent sentient beings, not as means to human ends.","There's a difference between early and late abortions. If you have a late abortion, where the fetus might feel pain, then I think you should have a good reason. Because then you're inflicting pain. As you go through the third trimester, you need to have more serious reasons to end a pregnancy.","Robots already perform many functions, from making cars to defusing bombs - or, more menacingly, firing missiles. Children and adults play with toy robots, while vacuum-cleaning robots are sucking up dirt in a growing number of homes and - as evidenced by YouTube videos - entertaining cats.","If we can put a man on the moon and sequence the human genome, we should be able to devise something close to a universal digital public library.","We should aim for our children to be good people, and to live ethical lives that manifest concern for others as well as for themselves.","At the descriptive level, certainly, you would expect different cultures to develop different sorts of ethics and obviously they have; that doesn't mean that you can't think of overarching ethical principles you would want people to follow in all kinds of places.","It means that, in fact, it's - whether fascist is the right word I don't know - more of a plutocracy than anything resembling a democracy; it has become a nation controlled by a very small, very wealthy elite.","If somebody has an extreme amount of wealth and is not using it for some good purpose, only for their own enjoyment or satisfaction, then clearly there's a moral failing in the world in which we live.","When diamonds' role in fuelling violent conflict in Africa gained worldwide attention, the diamond industry established the Kimberley process in order to keep \"blood diamonds\" out of international trade.","We tend to think that people are more to blame for their acts than for their omissions.","As we realize that more and more things have global impact, I think we're going to get people increasingly wanting to get away from a purely national interest.","I just don't think that the differences you make by donating to a museum or an art gallery really compare to the differences you make by donating to the charities that fight global poverty.","Many European countries, as well as Australia, Canada, Israel, and New Zealand, have adopted legislation that creates a 'public lending right', where the government recognises that enabling hundreds of people to read a single copy of a book provides a public good, but that doing so is likely to reduce sales of the book.","Today, if you have an Internet connection, you have at your fingertips an amount of information previously available only to those with access to the world's greatest libraries - indeed, in most respects what is available through the Internet dwarfs those libraries, and it is incomparably easier to find what you need.","Ancient recipients of instant news probably couldn't do very much about it, for instance. Xerxes would still need three months to get his army together, and he might not get home for years.","Bush doesn't present himself as a realpolitik politician.","Bush is morally a universalist. For instance, he says the freedom is good, the same thing is good, all over the world. So in that sense he's a universalist.","Bush sees the evil as out there in the wider world, residing in people who 'hate freedom'. Look at his immediate response to the pictures of prisoner abuse; this is not what Americans do, these are not our values.","Had Rumsfeld said at any time 'get me a report on what's going on', he could have had it. You're right, it depends on choices that we make, which parts of the world we want to be in immediate contact with.","I believe that nationalism is a very strong force, but there are other forces operating; there are tendencies pushing towards a larger picture, especially in Europe, I think; but I still think nationalism is real.","I don't think there's anything in the compromise that means that there's a clash of ethics.","I don't think there's much point in bemoaning the state of the world unless there's some way you can think of to improve it. Otherwise, don't bother writing a book; go and find a tropical island and lie in the sun.","I suppose what's happened recently has confirmed suspicions I voiced in the book, and I think made clearer some of those things that I point out. For instance I have a section of the book where I talk about the possibility of torture.","I would like us to think about it more explicitly, and not take our intuitions as the given of ethics, but rather to reflect on it, and be more open about the fact that something is an ethical issues and think what we ought to do about it.","I'm a Utilitarian, so I don't see the rule against lying as absolute; it's always subject to some overriding utility which may prevent its exercise.","I'm not overly alarmist about it, but I do think there are some worrying signs, like the growing accumulation of wealth by a very small proportion of the population, plus elections in the US are much more dominated by money than anywhere else calling itself a democracy.","In a situation where many national leaders do the same thing and look out for national interests, and with an issue like global warming, you're likely to get no solution, so I think you have to have some kind of ethical trump on some of those issues.","In the sense that you're not at the centre of power, like a president or prime minister of a major power, everyone is marginalised; my position doesn't isn't unique in that respect. I think there are different sorts of relevance in different contexts.","It's also much clearer how much damage the occupation of Iraq is doing to America's reputation and prestige around the world; and that's just starting now to hit home in the United States.","My work is based on the assumption that clarity and consistency in our moral thinking is likely, in the long run, to lead us to hold better views on ethical issues.","The idea that we can actually have an impact on places more or less instantly, too, by responding in some way or not responding, I think, also makes it true.","The Pentagon said that these prisoners were kept in accordance with the Geneva Convention, and of course I was not reassured by that, but I couldn't prove that that was wrong; so we're clearer about that.","Then I think the sense of it being one community breaks down; but if you know instantly and respond within twenty-four hours, it's a very different sort of situation.","They tend to be pretty abstract ones then, like doing what will have the best consequences; obviously you wouldn't specify what consequences are best, they may be different in some circumstances, so at a lower, more specific level, you may well get differences.","We see things like reciprocity which are fairly central to our view of ethics. But if you're talking about a set of worked-out rules on what we are supposed to do then, yes, it is a human product.","What you could say, and what I do argue in the book, is that he doesn't have as much concern for the lives of Iraqis as he does for the lives of Americans, or even frozen American embryos.","You might hold an ethical position that it's wrong to lie, but if you have plans for a war in Iraq, and you want to keep them secret for practical reasons - to reduce casualties, perhaps - and someone asks you about those plans, you may need to lie for a 'good' outcome.","Scholars have long dreamed of a universal library containing everything that has ever been written.","Sometimes we know the best thing to do, but fail to do it. New year's resolutions are often like that. We make resolutions because we know it would be better for us to lose weight, or get fit, or spend more time with our children. The problem is that a resolution is generally easier to break than it is to keep.","For example, one way of giving yourself a strong incentive to reach your goal is to commit to pay money to someone if you fail. Better yet, you can specify that you will have to pay a certain sum to a cause that you detest.","But I think the majority of cows, and even more so chickens and pigs, are leading pretty miserable lives.","If we all think only of our own interests, we are headed for collective disaster - just look at what we are doing to our planet's climate.","We recognize the chicken as another conscious being. It's different from us, but it has a life, and if something is really important for that chicken, if it would work hard to try to get it, and if we can give it without sacrificing something that's really important to us, then we should.","If you go back in time you'll find tribes that were essentially only concerned with their own tribal members. If you were a member of another tribe, you could be killed with impunity.","There is no doubt that there is a huge difference between human and nonhuman animals. But what we are overlooking is the fact that nonhuman animals are conscious beings, that they can suffer.","In most of the world, it is accepted that if animals are to be killed for food, they should be killed without suffering.","There is no humane slaughter requirement for wild fish caught and killed at sea, nor, in most places, for farmed fish.","We need to learn how to capture and kill wild fish humanely - or, if that is not possible, to find less cruel and more sustainable alternatives to eating them.","In a democracy, citizens pass judgment on their government, and if they are kept in the dark about what their government is doing, they cannot be in a position to make well-grounded decisions.","If governments did not mislead their citizens so often, there would be less need for secrecy, and if leaders knew they could not rely on keeping the public in the dark about what they are doing, they would have a powerful incentive to behave better.","Knowledge is generally considered a good thing; so, presumably, knowing more about how the U.S. thinks and operates around the world is also good.","The belief that the animals exist because God created them - and that he created them so we can better meet our needs - is contrary to our scientific understanding of evolution and, of course, to the fossil record, which shows the existence of non-human primates and other animals millions of years before there were any human beings at all.","If we are concerned about the exploitation of human workers in countries with low standards of worker protection, we should also be concerned about the treatment of even more defenceless non-human animals.","So I think ethics is the broader thing that's less focused on prohibitions and is more perhaps looking at principles and questions and ideas about how to live your life.","So, basically, my view is I don't want to support the exploitation of animals, and within reason, I will do what I can to avoid it, but it's not like it's a religion for me. It's not like I consider I'm polluted if somehow some bit of milk or cheese or something passes my lips.","The hope of Internet anarchists was that repressive governments would have only two options: accept the Internet with its limitless possibilities of spreading information, or restrict Internet access to the ruling elite and turn your back on the 21st century, as North Korea has done.","What is faith? If you believe something because you have evidence for it, or rational argument, that is not faith. So faith seems to be believing something despite the absence of evidence or rational argument for it.","I honestly don't know, but if America continues to refuse to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, I see a bleak future not only for American society, but for the world as a whole. This is a global problem that is not going away, and the United States is an obstacle to solving it.","Grain that is used to feed animals that end up on our tables as turkeys and hams could have gone to feed starving people.","Well the real concept of basic needs if you cut it right down are simply the physical needs that are unavoidable for all of us. So to have enough calories to keep our bodies going. Have shelter from extreme elements. To have water that is safe to drink, So I think that's the core of it.","Privacy about giving is counterproductive. There is solid scientific research showing that people are more likely to give if they can see that others are giving. The richest people, in particular, should be setting an example.","We have a new generation of very rich people who want to do more with their money than buy a lot of expensive toys. They want to live meaningful lives.","Interest in business ethics courses has surged, and student activities at leading business schools are more focused than ever before on making business serve long-term social values.","Business ethics has always had problems that are distinct from those of other professions, such as medicine, law, engineering, dentistry, or nursing.","Do business managers have a commitment to anything more than the success of their company and to making money? It would be hard to say that they do. Indeed, many business leaders deny that there is any conflict between self-interest and the interests of all.","We may feel the pain of falling back from a level of affluence to which we have grown accustomed, but most people in developed countries are still, by historical standards, extraordinarily well off.","When you look at food as an ethical issue in the Christian tradition, you don't find very much about it. You don't find, as you do in the Jewish or Islamic or Hindu traditions, a lot of restrictions saying you can eat this but you can't eat that.","Some vegetarians and vegans may object to in vitro meat, because they don't see the need for meat at all. That's fine for them, and of course they are free to remain vegetarians and vegans and choose not to eat in vitro meat.","Open government is, within limits, an ideal that we all share. U.S. President Barack Obama endorsed it when he took office in January 2009.","Even in non-democratic countries, people have a legitimate interest in knowing about actions taken by the government.","Paradoxically, resource-rich developing countries are often worse off than comparable countries that lack those resources. One reason for this is that large resource endowments provide a huge financial incentive for attempts to overthrow the government and seize power.","If we use goods made from raw materials that are obtained from a poor country without the proceeds being used to benefit the people of that country, we become complicit in a particularly iniquitous form of grand larceny.","For a long time, rich countries have promised to reduce poverty but have failed to match their words with adequate action. Of course, some important progress has been made and millions of lives have been saved, but millions more could be saved.","To make sustainable progress in reducing extreme poverty will require improvements in both the quantity and quality of aid.","More people with HIV/Aids are getting inexpensive anti-retroviral drugs, and their life expectancy has increased, but universal access is still far off, and the disease is still spreading, if more slowly than before.","Google has withdrawn from China, arguing that it is no longer willing to design its search engine to block information that the Chinese government does not wish its citizens to have. In liberal democracies around the world, this decision has generally been greeted with enthusiasm.","Even with censorship, the Internet is a force for change.","In most countries, it is possible to visit zoos and see bored animals pacing back and forth in cages, with nothing to do but wait for the next meal. Circuses are even worse places for animals. Their living conditions are deplorable, especially in travelling circuses where cages have to be small so that they can go on the road.","Most of the robots being developed for home use are functional in design - Gecko's homecare robot looks rather like the Star Wars robot R2-D2. Honda and Sony are designing robots that look more like the same movie's 'android' C-3PO.","There is no doubt that the world economy is in trouble. But if governments or individuals use this as an excuse to reduce assistance to the world's poorest people, they will only multiply the seriousness of the problem for the world as a whole.","If extreme poverty is allowed to increase, it will give rise to new problems, including new diseases that will spread from countries that cannot provide adequate healthcare to those that can. Poverty will lead to more migrants seeking to move, whether legally or not, to rich nations.","Almost everybody accepts that some people can be killed. 'The concept of 'brain death' - the belief that people on respirators can legitimately be killed - shows that.","I think I get angry when people cause serious suffering or don't alleviate suffering when they could.","Americans think they're the leader of the world and yet can say that they're putting their economic interests ahead of the lives of - quite possibly - tens of millions of people who over the next 50 years will die because of floods or storms or tropical diseases or whatever. I guess that sort of thing makes me angry."],"Peter Sis":["People think children's books are about teddy bears and little flowers. I realize people sometimes don't know what to do with my books because they say, 'Is it a children's book, and what age group?'","The birds never needed passports... We always thought, the birds can go wherever they want, and we couldn't, really. The birds were very much the symbol of... free movement for me.","I always think like I was born in the country where everybody ate apples. Then I ended up in the country where everybody eats bananas. So now, I eat bananas so long, I'm just remembering the apples.","I had a very comfortable life, but there were people who spent their life in prison, whose families were destroyed.","If I would use anything from 'The Little Prince,' even some little quote, it's all copyrighted in France. Like Walt Disney in this country, it's a national treasure.","I am afraid that people will think I re-illustrated 'The Little Prince,' when really, it was more a tribute to him as a dedicated pilot and a man who believed in the goodness of people.","How do you visualize something you've never seen and just imagined, through someone you love very much?","I grew up in society when lots of things were hidden, and they were not hidden just one way, but it was very complicated.","I didn't understand in the beginning that the editor didn't want me to know the author. I'd make an effort to meet the author, but it would end up being a disaster because then I had the author telling me what I should be doing.","When I do my own books, I take it as more of my own confessional, but when I illustrate for other people, it is intriguing because I feel like I shouldn't be stepping too much into the limelight. It's like playing the piano while someone else is singing.","Ursula Nordstrom was famous for finding artists in unlikely places. Maurice Sendak was a window designer, and she just came across one of his windows. Everyone was looking to find a talent.","I'm a visual person, so it always starts with a picture, and then I get obsessed with the idea, sometimes too much. I have these blank books in which I take notes, and I add postcards and other physical items.","When I was about 12 or 13, my father gave me 'The Little Prince.' He was making sure that I knew it was a special book. I'd seen the name of Antoine de Saint-Exupery, but to me it seemed a very French name, and I was not excited about him as a person.","When you have little children, you want to tell them about joy and happiness and hope. And then comes the time you want to tell them there are tough moments. I admire people who can do that.","I know there are some good American police. But I grew up in a country where we were afraid of the police.","I still have an accent. But when I return to Prague, I speak the language yet do not know what they are talking about.","I still dream about doing something simple, very simple and universal.","My father documented on film for the last time what Tibet looked like before the world got there.","I trust the pictures to tell what I want to say."],"Peter Slipper":["The importance of the House is... far more important than my future.","Frankly, I've got to admit that I'm not perfect and have made some mistakes as some of the colourful stories about me reveal.","While it has been hurtful to my family and me to read constantly in the media that I was under investigation, I am pleased that as expected my spending has been found to be in order.","I believe I am entitled like any other person to have the presumption of innocence.","Pope Benedict is an amazingly visionary person. What he has done is establish an evolutionary process that will help undo the Reformation. The Anglican Church has been hijacked by modernism, with synods trying to amend the faith and this process will allow traditional Anglicans to be themselves.","My door remains always open to all constituents to discuss matters of concern to them.","I reiterate that I am strongly committed to working with those on all sides of politics to improve how Parliament operates."],"Peter Snell":["As a teenager I had no idea that I had the potential to win an Olympic gold medal and my athletic career developed only by lucky circumstances.","Running became boring because it's so predictable. I got to a point where I knew what my competition could do."],"Peter Sotos":["And books that were published in much larger numbers than Selfish, Little are hard to find. And publishers who wanted to publish my last few works have them stuck in limbo while new distribution ideas and legal issues and fears are blown away.","But, right now, the situation is that almost all of my writing is out of print.","Further, for once, I like the idea that people who think I'm a constant voice for the furthering of the imagination have to see that interest in a more materialistic fashion.","Further, I'm obsessed with how language contorts and creates bodies.","I don't publish the books to make money, not at all.","I don't sell enough books to pay for the lawyers, however. And these various problems finally became too much.","I'm not trying to do conceptual art.","If you look at the publishers I've worked with, generally, they're a great bunch. Creation is unlike any other publishing house you can think of. The people I've worked with have integrity and intelligence and, almost always, less money than ideas.","In the past the publishers I've worked with have been extremely generous. And in almost every case, have been people who believed in the work rather than the sales and marketing.","Most of my books have caused distribution and printing problems in the past.","Once again, I think there is little art being done that really owns up to such intense possibilities.","The book grew out of the introduction I did for Brady's Gates of Janus. I knew that the writing in that introduction had a better than average chance of being read by people involved in Brady's life - parents of victims, police, Brady himself."],"Peter Sperling":["Arcadia is one of the most beautiful neighborhoods in all of Arizona, and I love living here.","It is no accident that our business, The University of Phoenix, is one of the top 50 community-minded companies in America. My father and I are strong believers in the concept of community.","Both my father and I remodeled our homes but were quite careful about preserving the history and unique character of the community.","It's nearly impossible to overstate how fully my father has devoted himself to Apollo Group and its mission since he created Apollo Group four decades ago.","We are very fortunate to have Matt Carter join the Apollo board. Matt brings deep management, operations, marketing and international business expertise to the company, along with a track record of growing and strengthening well-known consumer brands."],"Peter Steele":["I'm a big fan of the effects of alcohol.","I think anyone who has an opinion, and voices it, will offend someone.","There's a lot of things that go on when you're on tour that cannot be controlled. I'm not even talking about myself, but of course there's sexual activity and drugs, fighting and language; it is certainly not a place to raise a family.","I like to put on hardcore when I have to clean my apartment, which I hate to do, but it's motivational. I like old heavy metal when I'm outside working on my car. Music has definite functions for me.","There are no atheists in foxholes, they say, and I was a foxhole atheist for a long time. But after going through a midlife crisis and having many things change very quickly, it made me realize my mortality. And when you start to think about death, you start to think about what's after it. And then you start hoping there is a God.","Instead of slashing my wrists, I just write a bunch of really crummy songs.","I used to try to run five miles every other day, which I worked up to and I was doing it, but I was subjected to my own thoughts for forty minutes without any sensory input, and I couldn't stand what I thought.","Yes, there are times when I get extremely depressed and how I sublimate those feelings is through music.","Well, darkness with humor... I'm not an extremely suicidal or sad person.","I've been told by people that it's okay to cry but, you know what, it's been used against me.","One of the things I've always personally tried to stress with this band was to have some kind of visual aspect and to be consistent with it - like, not to change.","I'm a 'specist.' I hate the human race. Of course, therefore, I hate myself the most, because I am the least of the human race. I'm the product of 6 million years of evolution? Come on, man.","If I wasn't bound to Brooklyn, due to my own personal reasons like taking care of my mother and the fact that this is where the band is based, I would probably move to Iceland.","I just like being a social experiment sometimes. I really should not be allowed in public. But I just go out into the public just to see people's reaction.","I don't believe in, and I am a devout non-believer, in playing new songs live if the subjected and pathetic crowd has not heard them before because I consider it like mass psychosis and genocidal.","To see someone 70 years old with dyed black hair, you're like, 'Hmmm, I dunno. Is that a wrinkled teenager? What is that?' So at some point, I'm going to have to stop doing this. It's gonna look ridiculous. I don't wanna look like Elvis Presley at 60 years old.","We're the only species who hunts for sport.","I think I've changed a lot as a person.","I feel that I've grown up a little bit and I'm actually ready to settle down.","Sometimes, I write '60s or '80s style pop songs.","I've always been very image prone, along the lines of bands like Black Sabbath and even Devo.","I don't know what to say to that, but I have to agree with Johnny that, yeah, we do touch upon things that most men would rather not admit: That we feel pain, we cry, get sad and sometimes don't deal well with disappointment.","So I don't cry anymore, I just beat people up. It's a lot more fun.","As far as humor goes, I've always been a very insecure person and I've always wanted to be liked.","If they weren't laughing with me, okay; if they want to laugh at me it's better than nothing.","I think aerobics are great, of course, but it just bores me out of my mind.","Finding fresh song topics can sometimes be quite difficult.","I want to stay away from politics, or else I'll probably end up putting my size fifteen foot into my mouth.","I stay way from that area, and there's only so many songs you can write about love, sex and death.","I don't really like to play live. I don't like to be on stage. I feel very self-conscious.","I also like to eat very much, so I like all different types of foods.","It seems to be that southern Europeans are just more intimate socially, whereas I like a lot of personal space - like, a mile from the nearest person is fine for me.","So, I simply switched over to wine because it was not carbonated.","I drink for the effect, because it loosens up the tongue a little bit.","Technically, at this point we're no longer with the label; we've fulfilled our contract.","I guess I've learned that there's really no such thing as a bad label, there is only a bad contract.","It's bad poetry executed by people that can't sing. That's my definition of Rap.","I find that different types of music are good for certain activities.","Most bands don't even last fourteen months let alone fourteen years.","I hate the human race. Of course, therefore, I hate myself the most, because I am the least of the human race.","I'm the product of 6 million years of evolution? Come on, man. I crawled out of a swamp yesterday.","If someone told me when I was 16 or 18 years old that I'd be doing a side project with Tony Iommi, I wouldn't have believed it.","When I wrote songs like 'Everyone I Love is Dead,' I never thought about how I was going to execute them live.","I think all recent music sucks, and that includes Type O Negative.","I just like being a social experiment sometimes. I really should not be allowed in public. But I just go out into the public just to see people's reaction. The thing is, I can do anything I want, virtually, within reason, just to see people's reaction."],"Peter Stone":["I have come to the conclusion that one useless man is called a disgrace, that two are called a law firm, and that three or more become a congress.","This is a revolution, damnit! We're going to have to offend somebody!","Musicals are written and then rewritten. Those things used to happen on the road. Now they are done in New York during preview performances.","At early previews, the theater gossips are there, wishing you ill every night. They don't grant you any slack.

In 2011, two Iraqi refugees were arrested in Kentucky for conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals abroad in support of al-Qaeda in Iraq, the predecessor to ISIL.","America has a long and proud history of providing safe harbor for refugees. We must continue to do so, but in a way that keeps America safe.","I mean, I really don't want the federal government to be determining whether or not a person who feels certain ways about the environment or about animals or about certain religious issues should be considered an extremist. That to me is a type of thought control, mind control, which is very dangerous.","I support mosques, obviously. We need churches, temples, mosques. Whatever people use to speak with their god or to receive spiritual inspiration is good for the country.

Iraq has an educated class of people who are positioned to come in and take over.","But 85 percent of the mosques have extremist leadership in this country. Most Muslims, the overwhelming majority of Muslims, are loyal Americans.","Just several years ago, Shaykh Kabbani, who is the head of the Islamic Supreme Council of America, when he was speaking at the State Department, said that more than 80 percent of the mosques were controlled by extremists. And from all I've seen over the last four or five years, the situation has even gotten worse.","There are too many people sympathetic to radical Islam. We should be looking at them more carefully and finding out how we can infiltrate them.","I think there has been a lack of full cooperation from too many people in the Muslim community.","And if the imam and the Muslim leadership in that community is so intent on building bridges, then they should voluntarily move the mosque away from ground zero and move it whether it's uptown or somewhere else, but move it away from that area, the same as the pope directed the Carmelite nuns to move a convent away from Auschwitz.","The Muslims have, as everyone else says, the right to practice their religion and they have the right to construct a mosque at ground zero if they wish. What I am saying, though, is that they should listen to public opinion, they should listen to the deep wounds and anguish that this is causing to so many good people.","I don't know anyone at the highest levels who approved Abu Ghraib. If President Barack Obama for a moment thought that somebody at a high level had approved it, he would go after them.","The Democrats in the Senate adopted a resolution, an amendment, saying that there should be no Guantanamo detainees brought into this country. So, more and more, we're finding the American people on one side, the ACLU and the troglodytes from the New York Times on the other, where they belong.","And I think people who sort of glibly say, 'Well, you know, they're not going to handle security, UAE is a great ally,' four and a half years ago, they were not an ally, they were working with the enemy, and if those same people are still there today that were there then, these are real serious issues.","My legislation would cut off all funding for trials of anyone from Guantanamo in any court in the United States of America. This bill would help stop the misguided plan to put Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and other 9/11 terrorists on trial in Downtown Manhattan.","We can't gather the intelligence we need to foil future attacks, if we are blindly granting terrorists the right to remain silent. But for some reason, we've already done that - with the terrorist who tried to bring down Flight 253.","We are a nation at war - and we should act like it.","I think I'm one of the people who brought about peace in Ireland.","When things did go wrong for the IRA, when civilians were killed, I tried to put it in context, not defend it.","Being out in the street is not an expectation of privacy. Anyone can look at you, can see you, can watch what you're doing.","I do think we need more cameras. We have to stay ahead of the terrorists, and I do know in New York, the Lower Manhattan Security Initiative, which is based on cameras, the outstanding work that results from that.","Now, we don't get that many specific threats against sporting events, per se. But we know from listening to the chatter how terrorists want to attack iconic events. So whether it's a major Fourth of July celebration or the Super Bowl or the World Series, we assume that that is what they're targeting.","In the real world in which we live, it's a dangerous world. And you know the old saying is that we have to be right 100 percent of the time; the terrorists only have to be right once.","I'm saying this as a Republican: In the White House, the effort that goes in and wherever these decisions are made, as to limit civilian casualties, is more probably than any in the history of the world, especially when you consider the history of warfare.","I have been to Guantanamo. It's a model prison. Is it ideal? No. But we live in a very un-ideal world.","If civilians are killed in an attack on a military installation, it is certainly regrettable, but I will not morally blame the I.R.A. for it.","I like Donald Trump; he's been good to me. He supported me at rough times when I was being attacked by others.","Beyonce may be a gifted entertainer, but no one should really care what she thinks about any serious issue confronting our nation.","White House leaks of classified information put the lives of U.S. service members, intelligence officers, and civilians at risk. That's why I support a measure passed by the Senate Intelligence Committee to crack down on such leaks.","The president has a right to discuss his national security policies with the public. But that should be done in the light of day without endangering our sources or methods. The public has no need to know details about intelligence assets or special operations units. Such disclosures endanger those who protect us.","I was born in Manhattan, raised in Queens, went to high school and college in Brooklyn. My father was a city cop for over 30 years. To me, New York values are being patriotic, being strong, not panicking when there's a crisis, and trying to help each other out.","With all the fighting we do and all the skirmishing we do, the reality is that New Yorkers can come together when they have to.","Any New Yorker who even thinks of voting for Ted Cruz should have their head examined, Really, here's a guy who refused to sign onto the 9/11 health care act for the cops and firemen. Here's a guy who talks about New York values.","If you ask me what I think about going to work every day, it's 9/11 and preventing another 9/11. There were too many people I knew.","My goal, if I could have an ultimate goal, is to have new leaders emerge from within the Muslim community who are not defensive: who, day in, day out, are willing to denounce radicalizations, denounce the attempts by al Qaeda to go into their communities.","To me, we never get enough funding. In New York, we are clearly the number one terrorist target in the country.","It seems that, every several months, you have to expect there is going to be a terrorist incident or that there could be a terrorist incident somewhere. Right away, you're thinking, 'What are the consequences? Is this the first part of a larger attack? Is it coordinated, or a lone wolf?'"],"Peter Temple":["As far as I am concerned, I write novels, and other people can do the labelling.","In everything I've written, the crime has always just been an occasion to write about other things. I don't have a picture of myself as writing crime novels. I like fairly strong narratives, but it's a way of getting a plot moving.","I like having a plot; I like characters with a reason to get up in the morning.","The real difference between literature and pulp is the kind of emotional responses they elicit. Dan Brown can't pierce your heart. Patricia Cornwell can't make you read a sentence twice and then look sightlessly out of the window.","A lot of crime fiction writing is also lazy. Personality is supposed to be shown by the protagonist's taste in music, or we're told that the hero looks like the young Cary Grant. Film is the medium these writers are looking for.","For some men, life seems to be one long attempt to escape childhood and all the fears of childhood. That's what many of us are doing.","Football makes nonsense of class. It may make nonsense of colour in some circumstances.","There's a high point in your career, and then people get bored; they want something else to come along.","I suppose most crime writing is urban. There's not a lot... certainly not in Australia, people don't often set books in the countryside.","A lot of people like cabinet making; people are intrigued by it. Women in particular like cabinet making. They like it more than men do - the men are not really interested in the cabinet making.","In writing, I'm totally anti-plans of any kind. All my attempts to plan and plot novels have come to grief, and in expensive ways.","I think if you live in a country, basically you share the dominant values of a country although you may disagree on issues all the time.","I think Melbourne is by far and away the most interesting place in Australia, and I thought if I ever wrote a novel or crime novel of any kind, I had to set it here.","No book of mine is complete without a dog."],"Peter Thiel":["It's good to test yourself and develop your talents and ambitions as fully as you can and achieve greater success; but I think success is the feeling you get from a job well done, and the key thing is to do the work.","Creating value isn't enough - you also need to capture some of the value you create.","If I had known how hard it would be to do something new, particularly in the payments industry, I would never have started PayPal. That's why nobody with long experience in banking had done it. You needed to be naive enough to think that new things could be done.","Every one of today's smartphones has thousands of times more processing power than the computers that guided astronauts to the moon.","The core problem in our society is political correctness.","How to teach people to do what hasn't been done is a great riddle.","People don't want to believe that technology is broken. Pharmaceuticals, robotics, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology - all these areas where the progress has been a lot more limited than people think. And the question is why.","All of us have to work toward a definite future... that can motivate and inspire people to change the world.","Technology just means information technology.","One of my friends started a company in 1997, seven years before Facebook, called SocialNet. And they had all these ideas, and you could be, like, a cat, and I'd be a dog on the Internet, and we'd have this virtual reality, and we would just not be ourselves. That didn't work because reality always works better than any fake version of it.","The future is limitless.","The next Bill Gates will not start an operating system. The next Larry Page won't start a search engine. The next Mark Zuckerberg won't start a social network company. If you are copying these people, you are not learning from them.","Facebook succeeded because it was about real people having a presence on the Internet. There were all these other social networking sites people had, but they were all about fictional people.","Education is a bubble in a classic sense. To call something a bubble, it must be overpriced, and there must be an intense belief in it.","I had a good experience in college, but I don't think interdisciplinary education is something that's stressed very much at all. It's generally considered to be something of a bad idea.","I think anything that requires real global breakthroughs requires a degree of intensity and sustained effort that cannot be done part time, so it's something you have to do around the clock, and that doesn't compute with our existing educational system.","College gives people learning and also takes away future opportunities by loading the next generation down with debt.","I don't think success is complicated; if you do something that works, then it's a success.","The best start-ups might be considered slightly less extreme kinds of cults. The biggest difference is that cults tend to be fanatically wrong about something important. People at a successful start-up are fanatically right about something those outside it have missed.","When I was starting out, I followed along the path that seemed to be marked out for me - from high school to college to law school to professional life.","The most successful businesses have an idea for the future that's very different from the present - and that's not fully valued.","'Perfect competition' is considered both the ideal and the default state in Economics 101. So-called perfectly competitive markets achieve equilibrium when producer supply meets consumer demand.","I think people in Europe are generally pessimistic about the future. They have low expectations; they're not working hard to change things. When you're a slacker with a pessimistic view of the future, you're likely to meet those expectations.","Spiraling demand for resources of which our world contains a finite supply is the great long-term threat posed by globalisation. That is why we need new technology to relieve it.","We protect monopolies with copyright.","Men and machines are good at different things. People form plans and make decisions in complicated situations. We are less good at making sense of enormous amounts of data. Computers are exactly the opposite: they excel at efficient data processing but struggle to make basic judgments that would be simple for any human.","People are worried about privacy, and its one of the reasons people are using a service like SnapChat.","Most of 'big data' is a fraud because it is really 'dumb data.'","Credentials are critical if you want to do something professional. If you want to become a doctor or lawyer or teacher or professor, there is a credentialing process. But there are a lot of other things where it's not clear they're that important.","If the whole U.S. was like Silicon Valley, we'd be in good shape. But now, the entire U.S. is not driven by technology, is not driven by innovation.","People always say you should live your life as if it were your last day. I think you should live your life as though it will go on for ever; that every day is so good that you don't want it to end.","Every time you write an email, it is in the public domain. There are all these ways where security is not as good as people believe.","In Silicon Valley, I point out that many of the more successful entrepreneurs seem to be suffering from a mild form of Asperger's where it's like you're missing the imitation, socialization gene.","If you have a business idea that's extremely easy to copy, that can often become something of a challenge or problem.","Americans mythologize competition and credit it with saving us from socialist bread lines. Actually, capitalism and competition are opposites. Capitalism is premised on the accumulation of capital, but under perfect competition, all profits get competed away.","Investors are always biased to invest in things they themselves understand. So venture capitalists like Uber because they like driving in black town cars. They don't like Airbnb because they like staying in five-star hotels, not sleeping on people's couches.","I believe, basically, that individual freedom is very important.","People are spending way too much time thinking about climate change, way too little thinking about AI.","I believe that people are too complacent about technology.","From my perspective, I think the question of how we build a better future is an extremely important overarching question, and I think it's become obscured from us because we no longer think it's possible to have a meaningful conversation about the future.","Seventy percent of the planet is covered with water, and there's so much we can be doing with oceans, and it was one of the frontiers that people have more or less abandoned.","In a world where wealth is growing, you can get away with printing money. Doubling the debt over the next 20 years is not a problem.","In the '30s, the Keynesian stuff worked at least in the sense that you could print money without inflation because there was all this productivity growth happening. That's not going to work today.","I think it's a problem that we don't have more companies like Facebook. It shouldn't be the only company that's doing this well.","I believe we are in a world where innovation in stuff was outlawed. It was basically outlawed in the last 40 years - part of it was environmentalism, part of it was risk aversion.","Had the people who started Facebook decided to stay at Harvard, they would not have been able to build the company, and by the time they graduated in 2006, that window probably would have come and gone.","It is true that you can say that death is natural, but it is also natural to fight death. But if you stand up and say this is a big problem, we should do something about this, that makes people very uncomfortable, because they've made their peace with death.","Ideally, I want us to be working on things where if we're not working on them, they won't happen; companies where if we don't fund them they will not receive funding.","My only claim is that not all talented people should go to college and not all talented people should do the exact same thing.","The millennial generation in the US is the first that has reduced expectations from those of their parents. And I think there is something decadent and declinist about that.","There's always a sense that people will do things quite differently if they think they have privacy.","I think society is both something that's very real and very powerful, but on the whole quite problematic.","I think competition can make people stronger at whatever it is they're competing on. If we're competing in some athletic event for competitive swimmers, really intensely competing, it's likely that both of us will become better, but it's also quite possible we'll lose sight of what's truly valuable.","I did not want to write just another business book.","I'm very pro-science and pro-technology; I believe that these have been key drivers of progress in the world in the last centuries.","I think what's always important is not to be contrarian for its own sake but to really get at the truth.","I always find myself very distrustful of intense crowd phenomena, and I think those are things that we should always try to question, especially critically.","Great things happen only once.","Don't bother starting the 10,000th restaurant in Manhattan. Find something to do that if you don't do it, it won't get done.","We live in a world in which courage is in less supply than genius.","I do think there is this danger that our society has made its peace with decline. I'd like to jolt them out of their complacency a little bit.","I would like to live longer, and I would like other people to live longer.","I suspect Obama did not know he was recording Angela Merkel's cell phones.","I would not describe myself as a super early adopter of consumer technology.","A diploma is a dunce hat in disguise.","You don't want to just do 'me too' companies that are copying what others are doing.","What is it about our society where anyone who does not have Asperger's gets talked out of their heterodox ideas?","Is there something about the gay experience, being gay and the gay experience, that pushes us even more than other people toward competition?","If you do something new, it will always look a little bit strange.","There's absolutely no bubble in technology.","An entrepreneur must deal with more uncertainty than a professional with a well-defined role.","I spend an awful lot of time just thinking about what is going on in the world and talking to people about that. It's probably one of my default social activities, just getting dinners with friends.","You become a great writer by writing.","The model of the U.S. economy is that we are the country that does new things.","Our society, the dominant culture doesn't like science. It doesn't like technology.","Whereas a competitive firm must sell at the market price, a monopoly owns its market, so it can set its own prices. Since it has no competition, it produces at the quantity and price combination that maximizes its profits.","Airbnb is undervalued.","If you borrowed money and went to a college where the education didn't create any value, that is potentially a really big mistake.","There have been a lot of critiques of the finance industry's having possibly foisted subprime mortgages on unknowing buyers, and a lot of those kinds of arguments are even more powerful when used against college administrators who are probably in some ways engaged in equally misleading advertising.","When parents have invested enormous amounts of money in their kids' education, to find their kids coming back to live with them - well, that was not what they bargained for.","Monopolies are bad and deserve their reputation when things are static and the monopolies function as toll collectors... But I think they're quite positive when they're dynamic and do something new.","A conventional truth can be important - it's essential to learn elementary mathematics, for example - but it won't give you an edge. It's not a secret.","Contrarian thinking doesn't make any sense unless the world still has secrets left to give up.","You can achieve difficult things, but you can't achieve the impossible.","Every correct answer is necessarily a secret: something important and unknown, something hard to do but doable.","When people use the word 'science,' it's often a tell, like in poker, that you're bluffing.","If you're trying to develop a new drug, that costs you a billion dollars to get through the FDA. If you want to start a software company, you can get started with maybe $100,000.","Whenever I talk to people who founded a company, I often like to ask the prehistory questions 'When did you meet? How long have you been working before you started the company?' A bad answer is, 'We met at a networking event a week ago, and we started a company because we both want to be entrepreneurs.'","Unsolved problems are where you'll find opportunity. Energy is one sector with extremely urgent unsolved problems.","One of my first investments was $100,000 in a Web-based calendar startup - and I lost every dollar.","I would consider myself a rather staunch libertarian.","As an undergraduate at Stanford, I started 'The Stanford Review,' which ended up being very engaged in the hot debates of the time: campus speech codes, questions about diversity on campus, all sorts of debates like that.","I worked at a law firm in New York very briefly.","Technologies like PayPal foster competition because they enable people to shift their funds from one jurisdiction to another, and I think that ultimately will lead to a world in which there's less government power and therefore more individual control.","Anti-aging is an extremely under-explored field.","Great investments may look crazy but really may not be.","The first question we would ask if aliens landed on this planet is not, 'What does this mean for the economy or jobs?' It would be, 'Are they friendly or unfriendly?'","I believe that evolution is a true account of nature, but I think we should try to escape it or transcend it in our society.","I believe if we could enable people to live forever, we should do that. I think this is absolute.","I suspect if people live a lot longer they would be retired for a somewhat longer period of time. Just the financial planning takes on a very different character.","There is a sort of genre of optimistic science fiction that I like, and I don't think there is enough of. One of my favourites is a short story by Arthur C. Clarke, 'The City and the Stars.' It's set in this far future on Earth in this somewhat static society and trying to break out.","The big challenge with Internet financial services has been that it's very difficult to get large numbers of customers to sign up for your service.","My hope is that we're going to end up with a far more tolerant society, where the erosion of privacy, to the extent it erodes, will be offset by increased tolerance.","The optimism that many felt in the 1960s over labour-saving technology is giving way to a fearful question: 'Will your labour be good for anything in the future? Or will you be replaced by a machine?'","Properly defined, a startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future.","There's no single right place to be an entrepreneur, but certainly there's something about Silicon Valley.","You will never build a company on the scale of a Facebook or a Google if you sell it along the way.","Wall Street is always too biased toward short-term profitability and biased against long-term growth.","I think it's always good for gay people to come out, but it's also understandable why people might choose not to do so.","I'm not a politician. But neither is Donald Trump. He is a builder, and it's time to rebuild America.","When I moved to Cleveland, defense research was laying the foundations for the Internet. The Apollo program was just about to put a man on the moon - and it was Neil Armstrong, from right here in Ohio. The future felt limitless. But today, our government is broken.","Every American has a unique identity. I am proud to be gay. I am proud to be a Republican. But most of all, I am proud to be an American.","When I was a kid, the great debate was about how to defeat the Soviet Union. And we won. Now we are told that the great debate is about who gets to use which bathroom. This is a distraction from our real problems. Who cares?"],"Peter Thomson":["You can think best when you're happiest.","Use your brain, not your endurance.","A light, tender, sensitive touch is worth a ton of brawn.","The difference between winning and losing is always a mental one."],"Peter Tork":["Pop music, disco music, and heavy metal music is about shutting out the tensions of life, putting it away.","Put you energy into music. If it fails you, you can become an accountant or a dentist. And then if you become a dentist or an accountant, it's too late to become a musician afterwards.","I am more of an old black and white movies fan.","Oh, the most fun thing I've ever been asked to autograph was breasts.","Elvis deserves a lot of credit for bringing the blues to middle America, not the Vegas stuff. The early stuff, The Sun records, and the first few RCA records. He was wonderful, he had the power, the drive, and he was so dedicated to his music.","Every country has it trade offs.","Getting to play the blues has been transcendant for me. I can't say if my finest hour is yet to come, you want to make a dent in this world, well I do anyway.","Hitting a baseball well, as in cricket, is a very rare skill. One of most difficult things to do in the world to do, hitting a ball coming at you at ninety miles an hour with a round bat. Wonderful to watch.","I am a still friend with Dave Crosby, he's a weird duck but I like him a lot.","I did as well as I knew how and have nothing to be ashamed of.","I don't know about friends, but what time I spent with The Beatles they were very courteous to me.","I get to play a scorching lead guitar, and there's not much that's more fun than that.","I have never done Cult TV before, the convention was good. It gives the fans a chance to meet the celebrities. Connect with the guy that used to be a bunch of coloured dots on your TV screen.","I like to listen the blues and some classical.","I never listen to music in the house, I listen to music in the car.","It was so much fun to do, play the blues and then play a Monkees' set on the same night.","Michael Sunday and I are the original members of the band. We first did it just for charities and benefit concerts. It was very ad-hoc, and before we knew it, we were really a band. We went through several drummers and guitarists before we were happy with the line up.","My most favourite gigs that ever happened were solo, before The Monkees ever happened.","No, in 1968 I still wanted to be a Pop Star, and be about the music. Now, I want to be just about the music.","Only one of us would usually sing lead. Which most of the time was, Mickey or Dave. They thought it was perfectly a natural routine, because Mickey and Dave saw themselves as TV actors.","Original Monkees' songs were produced very thinly, on purpose.","Pop music is aspirin and the blues are vitamins.","Ringo is one of the world's true humans. The only one out those four guys, who did not have an agenda. Ringo was just into the music.","Shoe Suede Blues is ten years old this year. The Band consists of four members.","The blues brings you back into the fold. The blues isn't about the blues, it's about we have all had the blues and we are all in this together.","The four of us couldn't have made a record with the time left over when we were shooting the show. We were on stage from 7.30 in the morning 'til 7 at night. Later on, when there was a break from filming, and we were sick of doing it the old way.","The groupies are far more real now than there were then.","The Monkees was a straight sitcom, we used the same plots that were on the other situation comedies at the time. So the music wasn't threatening, we weren't threatening.","There hasn't been one show that we did, that I didn't enjoy to some extent.","We did very little improvisation on camera, and once in a while we did.","Yes, I am a good singer."],"Peter Tosh":["In the beginning there was the word. The word was Jah. The word is in I, Jah is in I. I make what is good, better, and what is better, best.

I only suffer the consequences.","I mean the flesh, never fade! The flesh never leave the creation, see, because with that divine spirit the flesh cannot fade. If the spirit is weak then the flesh fade, seen?","To have the truth in your possession you can be found guilty, sentenced to death.","And I ask why am I black, they say I was born in sin, and shamed inequity. One of the main songs we used to sing in church makes me sick, 'love wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.","I travel the garden of music, thru inspiration. It's a large, very large garden, seen?","I don't think the label cares about an album... People just want their number-one record."],"Peter Ueberroth":["The integrity of the game is everything.","Baseball is a public trust. Players turn over, owners turn over and certain commissioners turn over. But baseball goes on.","A cloud hangs over baseball. It's a cloud called drugs and it's permeated our game.","Other sports play once a week but this sport is with us every day.","It's not, 'We have a city to bid, now let's go check in with the federal government'.","The international game has changed for bidding cities.","The state is out of control, the state is on a spending binge, the state has to stop putting itself in a hole that's getting deeper and deeper and deeper.","This is America's Team and we are confident this outstanding group of athletes will make our country proud."],"Peter Uihlein":["Take Ernie Els. He plays in every country. You see his name everywhere. He's received in different parts of the world. It's a good experience.","I had always wanted to see the world, and the PGA Tour was always going to be there.","Winning is fun and great, but I would rather have a long, successful and healthy career than a short one with a few wins.","Name a country, and I have probably been there.","I did some traveling as an amateur and always loved the different places I saw.","I don't mind playing or watching a movie or sitting down.","You are going to hit some good shots and not get rewarded, but that's just U.S. Open golf. It's tough; it's hard.","I felt like, by the end of the week in the U.S. Amateur, I was never aiming at a flag; I was just hitting it at slopes and just letting the natural contours take over.","I'm just going to go out and play. At the end of the day, you are still hitting a little white ball with your clubs.","It's the Masters. If that doesn't get you nervous and your juices flowing, I don't know what does.","That's match play. You've got to get lucky. You've got to try to catch somebody on a down day when you have a down day.","I've never really been somebody who likes to hit it straight. That's just never been my forte, I guess.","St. Andrews is the Home of Golf and the greatest course in the world. Any time you can win at St. Andrews would be special. It's every golfer's dream to win out here.","I've never really been somebody that thinks too much about what I've done.","I've been trying to be the best representative for my school, my family, and the USGA as I possibly could.","The European Tour plays all over the world: from the U.K. to China, from Korea to South Africa, and from the Middle East to southeast Asia.","I've been to India, and I never thought I'd go there.","I went cage diving in South Africa with Great Whites, and that was fun. Sweden was cool.","As long as you can find a place to develop as an all-round player, then you're doing great.","I try to go out, check out the town, and have a good time. It's a life experience: not everyone gets the chance to see the world and play golf, do the thing you love while travelling.","Name me one golfer that doesn't get frustrated.","It's all about becoming a more well-rounded player and not a one-dimensional player. You might hear someone say, 'Hilton Head sets up well for them.' I don't want that stereotype.","I was born in Massachusetts. I live in Stillwater. I went to school in Florida.","There has been a great list of players who cut their teeth in Europe.","I loved my time at OSU. It was unbelievable experience, and I'm definitely going to miss it.","Golf has always been a part of my life. My parents have footage of me in a walker swinging a plastic club. If I didn't play golf, I would have been a baseball player. I could sit and watch baseball all day.","I grew up in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and I'm a huge Red Sox fan. I've probably been to Fenway 40 times. I've been pretty lucky as a sports fan because the Patriots have won Super Bowls and the Red Sox have won World Series during my lifetime.","When I was 13, I told my dad I wanted to move to Florida to attend the IMG Academy. I wanted to be a golfer, and that's hard to do in New England where I could only practice half the year.","My dad is just like everybody else's dad. I see him as kind of a goofy guy with a great sense of humor. I try to get in a battle of wits with him, but he always gets me. I emulate him because I've never seen anyone work as hard as he does.","It's an honor to win the Sir Henry Cotton Rookie of the Year award.","I'd definitely like to be one of the best golfers in the world, of all time.","I'd like to just win everything. It would just be awesome.","Playing with Phil Mickelson, it doesn't get any better than that.","Golf is a humbling sport.","The biggest thing was just getting comfortable out there in front of all the people and just the whole major setting and how difficult major championships are, how patient... you have to be."],"Peter Ustinov":["Comedy is simply a funny way of being serious.","Love is an act of endless forgiveness, a tender look which becomes a habit.","The point of living and of being an optimist is to be foolish enough to believe the best is yet to come.","Parents are the bones on which children cut their teeth.","It is our responsibilities, not ourselves, that we should take seriously.","I do not believe that friends are necessarily the people you like best, they are merely the people who got there first.","Courage is often lack of insight, whereas cowardice in many cases is based on good information.","People who reach the top of the tree are only those who haven't got the qualifications to detain them at the bottom.","In America, through pressure of conformity, there is freedom of choice, but nothing to choose from.","Her virtue was that she said what she thought, her vice that what she thought didn't amount to much.","Children are the only form of immortality that we can be sure of.","Men think about women. Women think about what men think about them.","If the world should blow itself up, the last audible voice would be that of an expert saying it can't be done.","If Botticelli were alive today he'd be working for Vogue.","A diplomat these days is nothing, but a head waiter who is allowed to sit down occasionally.","Once we are destined to live out our lives in the prison of our mind, our duty is to furnish it well.","Intelligent or not, we all make mistakes and perhaps the intelligent mistakes are the worst, because so much careful thought has gone into them.","Laughter would be bereaved if snobbery died.","Critics search for ages for the wrong word, which, to give them credit, they eventually find.","The social sciences were for all those who had not yet decided what to do with their lives, and for all those whose premature frustrations led them into the sterile alleys of confrontation.","Playwrights are like men who have been dining for a month in an Indian restaurant. After eating curry night after night, they deny the existence of asparagus.","Corruption is nature's way of restoring our faith in democracy.","Pavarotti is not vain, but conscious of being unique.","I'm convinced there's a small room in the attic of the Foreign Office where future diplomats are taught to stammer.","The habit of religion is oppressive, an easy way out of thought.","Contrary to general belief, I do not believe that friends are necessarily the people you like best, they are merely the people who got there first.","The truth is really an ambition which is beyond us.","I am an optimist, unrepentant and militant. After all, in order not to be a fool an optimist must know how sad a place the world can be. It is only the pessimist who finds this out anew every day.","The truth is an ambition which is beyond us.","By increasing the size of the keyhole, today's playwrights are in danger of doing away with the door.","I have four children which is not bad considering I'm not a Catholic.","Monica Seles: I'd hate to be next door to her on her wedding night.","The only reason I made a commercial for American Express was to pay for my American Express bill.","At the age of four with paper hats and wooden swords we're all Generals.

Brett":["My breakthrough was when I began to write during my commute, at first taking notes on my Palm Pilot, and then moving on to writing full prose on the tiny QWERTY keyboard of my iPaq smartphone. I got so fast that I was averaging 400 words during the 35 minutes or so I spent on the subway each way, or 800 words round trip.","There have been discussions of doing 'The Demon Cycle' on both large and small screen scale, and while there is no project currently in development, I think the series has both the big imagery and complex character development to have legs either as a TV series or film franchise.","I jump around in the plotting stage, where I basically just make a bulleted list of every damn thing that happens in the entire book.","The ward designs were co-created by myself and Lauren K. Cannon. She read how they were described in 'The Warded Man,' and we had long discussions about what sources to draw from for the symbols, drawing inspiration from Arabic, Japanese, Chinese and Sanskrit.","I think each book sort of finds its own theme as it goes on. 'Warded Man' was fear. 'Desert Spear' was exploration of the other. 'Daylight War' was relationships. Some of this is intentional, and some of it evolves naturally. The series as a whole is obviously something I have given a lot of thought to, but each book is its own animal as well.","I was heavily influenced by J. R. R. Tolkien, George R. R. Martin, C. S. Friedman, Terry Brooks, Robert Jordan, R. A. Salvatore, and James Clavell to name a few, but of course every book I've ever read, whether I liked it or not, has had an influence... I think I am constantly evolving as a writer, but not to mimic anyone else or mainstream trends.","I've been obsessed with demons since reading 'The Elfstones of Shannara' and 'Master of the Five Magics' by Lyndon Hardy.","Book four is tentatively titled 'The Skull Throne ,' and book five is 'The Core .' It's kind of hard to talk much about them without giving away things from 'Daylight War,' however.","Tolkien is considered the grandfather of fantasy and, for me, I consider myself the grandson, with Terry Brooks as the kind of crazy uncle of fantasy, being the one who brought me into it.","I think George R. R. Martin made fantasy grow up. He brought a level of reality into the storytelling where you realize the good guys don't always win and anyone can die, because that's how life works. Bringing that level of reality into the story I think forced the genre to mature in a lot of ways that it hadn't prior.","I read every review online, and I want to respond to those, but I resist the urge to do that.","When I made the decision to really get serious about my writing, I set myself a goal of 1,000 words a day for seven days. If I got to 7,000 words before Monday I could take a day off, but I had to get there. I had to do that every week."],"Peter Warlock":["Music is neither old nor modern: it is either good or bad music, and the date at which it was written has no significance whatever.","All old music was modern once, and much more of the music of yesterday already sounds more old-fashioned than works which were written three centuries ago.","All good music, whatever its date, is ageless - as alive and significant today as it was when it was written.","Dates and periods are of interest only to the student of musical history."],"Peter Weir":["Well, there's that girl on the Internet - although this isn't an example of someone who doesn't know they're on - but there's a girl on the Internet who posts one photograph every two minutes from her bedroom.","I enjoyed Jonathan Franzen's 'Freedom.' Would I make that into a film? I think it's better suited to television. That would very much be a dialogue and performance piece, and it would take some very skilful direction - but not my kind of directing. But I thought it was a real literary work.","Music stops you from thinking.","It was immediately apparent that it was full of tricky ingredients to balance. In fact, I found it very intriguing. What held me back from saying yes to the producer was that I wasn't sure who could play Truman.","Well, all these stars have their houses swept quite regularly by people who work in the surveillance security business. They come in and they look for bugs and things.","Normally as a director, you do look at other films and things that are relevant. But with this film, it became impossible because I became so aware of the camera placement.","I'd love to have another film to go on to. I'm in the mood to work. But I have to be patient, you know, to find that particular kind of project. Occasionally I'll write one myself if I can summon up the energy.","National film industries tend to move in cycles. In Australia right now, we're on a high, a feeling of potential, which as yet shows no sign of flagging. But the word 'industry' is misleading. A small national cinema has no industry in the Hollywood sense.","I've become wary of interviews in which you're forced to go back over the reasons why you made certain decisions. You tend to rationalize what you've done, to intellectually review a process that is often intuitive.","There's almost a fear that if you understood too deeply the way you arrived at choices, you could become self-conscious. In any case, many ideas which are full of personal meaning seem rather banal when you put words to them.","When I began making films, they were just movies: 'What's the new movie? What are you doing?' Now they're called 'adult dramas.'","You can mix in certain sensitivities as a filmmaker.","I loved Sherlock Holmes as a kid, but I remember being disappointed when he'd come up with these simple explanations for these complex mysteries.","Movies tie things up in an arbitrary length of time, but I have always liked things that aren't fully realised.","There was a point of frustration, where I thought I should just take a film, even though I didn't want to. I was impatient with being at home. But I hung on to the approach I've always had, which is to wait for a project that I could contribute something unique to.","I carve stone. I've got hammers and chisels and I carve from sandstone. I just did a big mural of birds and trees.","The best conversation with Stanley Kubrick is a silent one: you sit in a theatre and watch his films and you learn so much.","I'm not from a theatrical background where people do like to work it out on some stage space.","With more time I like to see the actors find something of their own places, so I can get their own ideas before I put mine in. Given they have a better idea more often enough.","Silent films were, I think, more different than we know to sound films. We think of it as simply that we added dialogue and in actual fact I think it was an entirely different art form."],"Peter Welch":["I represent a rural state and live in a small town. Small merchants make up the majority of Vermont's small businesses and thread our state together. It is the mom-and-pop grocers, farm-supply stores, coffee shops, bookstores and barber shops where Vermonters connect, conduct business and check in on one another.","To the extent that people overpay as a result of the Libor manipulation, they should be able to get their money back. Individuals who have mortgages, pension funds who had pensioner investments - whoever was ripped off is entitled to get their money back.","If you ask the question of Americans, should we pay our bills? One hundred percent would say yes. There's a significant misunderstanding on the debt ceiling. People think it's authorizing new spending. The debt ceiling doesn't authorize new spending; it allows us to pay obligations already incurred.","America pays its bills. It always has. It always will. The fact that Washington is now debating whether to honor its debts and obligations, then, should come as a surprise. But playing political football with a necessary vote to raise the nation's debt ceiling has become as predictable as a Twitter rant from Charlie Sheen.","We urge the Department of Justice to carefully investigate and aggressively prosecute all senior bank officials who participated in manipulating the London interbank offered rate throughout the financial crisis.","The Citizen's Petition reflects Vermont's spirit of pragmatism and across-the-board cooperation. I applaud the 'Campaign to Fix the Debt' for calling attention to one of the country's most pressing problems, our ballooning national debt, and for urging policymakers to find practical solutions.","The rhetoric on the Hill is getting very heated and it's getting quite dangerous. The gun is at the head of the American economy and Congress is holding it and its got a hair trigger. We've got to pay our bills.","Last night, I had a telephone townhall for my constituents back in Vermont, and we had 11,500 people on it. And I had people on Social Security saying if getting fewer benefits will help us on the debt, they're for it. And I had a farmer saying that he's had subsidies for 35 years but we can't afford them anymore.","I favor the extension of the middle-class tax cuts because in a recession they're stimulative and they help with demand.","One of the things I give Nancy Pelosi a lot of credit for is that she's able to get things passed and hold her members together because she shows us that she's doing everything possible to get our views into these bills.","There's a tendency in politics to attribute bad motivation much too quickly, and the sooner you attribute bad motivation to someone you disagree with, the harder it is to find some common ground to make some progress that would give people confidence that you got it more right than wrong.","If I tried to shout over my older brother, my mother told me keep quiet. If I tried to shout over my little sister, my father told me to shut up. I found the best way to be heard was to lower my voice and actually speak when I had something to say.","There's no conscious plan here; my whole life in politics as a state legislator and in Congress has been about strengthening the middle class.","Historically, the minority party in Congress votes against raising the debt limit, forcing the majority party to whip its members into casting politically painful votes in favor.","Yes, it is long past time we get serious about tackling the nation's ever-growing deficits. But the average American family drawn into serious debt cannot just threaten to stiff its creditors. It must cut its spending in the future, but also take responsibility for the debt incurred in the past.","Democrats can neither control nor predict whether our GOP counterparts are really ready to play chicken with the U.S. economy. But we can assure the American people that our party takes the nation's faith and credit seriously.","In Washington, 'delay' is too often code for 'derail.' Wink, wink.","Last year, Congress passed a law that directs the Federal Reserve to set limits on debit card swipe fees that are reasonable and proportional to the cost of processing those transactions. Like most Americans, I had no idea that swipe fees charged to American businesses are the highest in the world.","Swipe fees have increased steadily since the introduction of debit cards 20 years ago, when there were no swipe fees at all. Merchants can't negotiate or control them. They've tried, but they have no leverage against the big banks and issuers. So they get ignored.","Home Star is a common sense idea that would create jobs and provide a boost to local economies, while helping families afford their energy bills. By encouraging homeowners to invest in energy efficiency retrofits, Home Star would create 170,000 manufacturing and construction jobs that could not be outsourced to China.","The potential for Home Star to create jobs is proven and real. In Vermont, our statewide energy efficiency utility, Efficiency Vermont, created more than 430 jobs in 2007 and 2008, generating more than $40 million in income.","For an economic recovery program to be effective, it must not only create a short-term economic boost but also generate lasting value. Home Star would accomplish that by breaking down the key barrier between homeowners and money-saving retrofits: upfront costs.","Homes and buildings, many of which are old and drafty, eat up 40 percent of the energy America uses. Such inefficiencies perpetuate our reliance on foreign oil, imperiling our national security and increasing our contribution to climate change.","BP has finally acknowledged what the American people have been saying for weeks: It must take responsibility for its reckless conduct, clean up the Gulf and compensate the countless victims of the disaster it caused.","You know, I think when you are unemployed, especially for a long time, it's hard to be inspired or hopeful almost about anything. So it's tough, especially when there has been such gridlock here in D.C. You know, when we are fighting and can't get anything done, whether you are liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican, no one wins."],"Peter Weller":["The best reason to go to the movies is to be with other people. Eating the popcorn, being with other people you don't know.","Television is an isolating experience, sadly enough. I'm sorry to say it. But as good as it ever gets, it's still isolating. You sit in your home and visit with no one.","I don't care for horror and fantasy films. I never go to see them in the theater. I know I've played in many of them, but I didn't do them because of their genre - I did them just because I loved their scripts.","My career was always full of risks one way or another, and that's the way I like it.","When I go to the movies, I like romance, comedy, and thrillers. I hate gore.","A lot of things I don't do well; I don't do warm and fuzzy well.","Art has absolutely changed my life.","I'm just gonna be real grateful to be on any freaking movie set for the rest of my life.","The goals are not about the sweet smell of success as much as it's about enjoying a damn day on the movie set... I live in a complete state of grace.","I steer away from episodic TV; it burns you out.","I'm finishing my Ph.D. in Italian Renaissance history."],"Peter Woo":["Mentorship is critical for young people. Mentorship by others for my children is very high on my agenda.","Without constantly pushing my senior colleagues to formulate decisions, I would never be able to learn and know what they are made of.","Judgment is a delicate thing and does not come overnight."],"Peter Wright":["When I look at some of my old work, the pieces I find most interesting are the ones with people in them.","As a kid I quite fancied the romantic, Bohemian idea of being an artist. I expect I thought I could escape from the difficulties of maths and spelling. Maybe I thought I would avoid the judgement of the establishment.","I've had to do all kinds of jobs to pay the rent. I've even worked in a Cornish tin mine.","I tried to learn the violin for a while.","I had been living with dialysis for three years or so, and the new kidney felt like a reprieve, a new gift of life. I felt alive again and I guess that has had an effect on my use of colour.","I have never subscribed to the Dirty Pallet school of painting.","I felt the need to get back to painting and I thought the best way was to start drawing, so I enrolled in a life drawing class. I soon discovered that people made very interesting subjects and I am still surprised that I had never discovered it before.","I have to experiment with methods and I'm trying to find an authentic way of making an equivalent of the living, breathing person within the limits of a single picture.","I used to paint landscapes without any people in them but now I paint people who happen to be in a particular place. They might be outside a pub, or on a beach or in a studio. They might have clothes on or they might not.","I think most people see drawing as subservient to the subject, a sort of meditation, a studying, a searching observation, in my case, for its own sake.","Painting is seen as picture making, the making of an art object, something that can stand on its own.","I never know what it's going to look like. Wouldn't be much point in painting if I already knew the outcome. I have a subject in front of me and I start flooding colour and making marks, I don't know, it's improvisation isn't it?","You could always go on changing things but there comes a time when you have to decide to stop."],"Peter Yarrow":["We can only move to a long-term resolution regarding terrorism and war by planting seeds of peace. We have to start with ourselves.","We Americans are world leaders and we must lead by example - particularly in times that require careful deliberation before any precipitous action - lest we fail to walk in the shoes of those we might injure.","To cure the violence, we must identify and heal the causes of hatred and violence. If we don't deal with the causes we will never be safe.","I feel like I need to sing again."],"Peter York":["In the 1940s, cigarettes would be shown in classy situations, endorsed by celebrities - real A-list Hollywood stars in America - the ads would make claims about tobacco quality or manufacturing science and, bizarrely, some brands had what almost amounted to health claims.","My friends adore 'TOWIE' - the TV documentary series, 'The Only Way is Essex.' They like it, I'm afraid, for the most unworthy of reasons: class mockery. They tune in to wonder in a 'can you believe those people?' way at the natives of Brentwood and Buckhurst Hill.","Rock and roll is the hamburger that ate the world.","People are fretful about lifestyle retailing because the idea that anyone's immortal soul and deepest longings can be quite so readily anticipated and consolidated with several hundred thousand other like-minded types is worrying.","Like lots of baby boomers, I was brought up on archaic anthropomorphism. Upstanding Christian dogs. Rabbits with family values. Because the ancient texts and pictures were sacred - Potter, Milne and the rest. Even concerned parents who knew Freud and Jung never saw the contradictions in feeding us on them.","By the late Nineties, we had become a more visual nation. Big-money taste moved to global standards - new architecture, design and show-off contemporary art. The Sloane domestic aesthetic - symmetry, class symbolism and brown furniture - became as unfashionable as it had been hot in the early Eighties.","Men turn to formal wear when they want a new job or when they think their current one is in danger. They try to present themselves as powerful and successful.","Advertising has always been a huge unrecognised source of outdoor relief for the arts.","One should never learn from one's mistakes. Making the same mistakes, over and over again, is a source of unremitting pleasure.","Kate Middleton's a pretty girl who sounds nice.","Chandeliers are marvels of drop-dead showiness, the jewellery of architecture.","There is an interior style we intellectuals and design policy wonks know as Haut Euro Pooftastic, which really takes the biscuit.","Successive generations of middle-class parents used to foist their own favourite books on their children. But some time in the late Eighties it began to wane - not because children had lost interest in adorable animals but because most of it was available on useful, pacifying video.","Socially smart people have always mocked the threateningly mobile, and anti-branding is a central strand of high-end status conflict now.","The White Company offers its loyalists an altogether better, whiter world. The White people have edited out any colours that aren't white, off-white, milk chocolate, grey, taupe or black. They can't be doing with Johnnie Boden's cheery Sloane jokes, his spots and stripes, his occasional 'if it's me, it's U' loud colours.","I often find myself worrying about celebrities. It's an entirely caring thing; it's not like the people who commission those photographs with cruel arrows to go on the covers of the celebrity magazines. The photographs show botched plastic surgery, raging eczema, weight gain and horrible clothes for maximum schadenfreude.","If beauty isn't genius it usually signals at least a high level of animal cunning.","George Bush is by American standards rabidly Upper Class - Eastern, Socially Attractive, WASP, 19th-century money, several generations of Andover and Yale (and, while we're at it, his father, George H. W. 'Poppy' Bush, was a former president and his grandfather was the Nazis' U.S. banker in the 1930s).","In London - and forget those extra public pressures on politicians - the lovely old Sloane world of manor houses simply hasn't cut it since Big Bang in 1986, the point at which Mrs. Thatcher really started to achieve her ambition to make this country more like America - its ambition, economy, it's very tangible measures of success.","London clubland divides itself between the St James's refuge for toffs, and the Conquest of Cool, for the arts and media.","Real writers - serious writers with serious subjects, who earn their living at it - all seem to write in small rooms with that knotty-pine 1974 look on the top-floor rear of their houses. Rooms with views.","It's just as well that I write in the same facile way wherever I am - no blocks or anguish, no contemplation, no elaborate revision, no need for love-tokens or nice views.","The old process of social assimilation used to be mainly about English new money - generated in London, the mucky, brassy North or the colonies - buying those houses and restoring them, and doing the three-generation thing, mouldering into the landscape, and the 'community,' identifying with the place in a familiar way.","Global new money has houses everywhere, and serious helicopters, it doesn't aspire to the Miss Marple life of St. Mary Mead.","Imagine a State occasion where the Queen is wearing trainers with her tiara because she thinks it will make people like her better, more folksy. It's unthinkable. But that's patently the thought process Gordon Brown (or his spin doctor) went through before the Prime Minister appeared on the world stage in Beijing without his suit and tie.","There was a time when formal clothes were one of life's great pleasures, as well as a way of describing instantly a man's status wealth. Toffs wore the most, the proles the least. Fast forward to 2008 and clothes are still an unrivalled pleasure but some men - and this includes many of our betters - have confused status with fake informality.","For me, wearing a tie is a pleasure, a recherche one but a pleasure nonetheless. You could say that I'm avoiding tie avoidance. My own gorgeous collection runs into hundreds and I buy them the way I buy books - I simply can't pass a shop. I have loved them since I could spend my own money on them.","I can remember when anything further downtown New York than Canal Street was risky and the whole area still looked like a '70s cop movie location; when the original loft-owners were more dash-than-cash, artistic types.","Selling scent is a key job for celebrities. At any one time, there'll be hundreds of them at it, going on the world's talk shows, doing photo-shoots, providing employment for thousands. Celebrities are instant brands.","I cling to the basic set of tenets laid out in Tom Wolfe's 'New Journalism' - to get out there like the great French novelists of the 19th century and study life. I am a Tom Wolfe fan of the first order.","When you get inside a literary novel you feel that the author, more often than not, just doesn't know enough about things. They haven't been around enough - novelists never go anywhere. Once I discovered true books about real things - books like 'How To Run a Company' - I stopped reading novels.","I'm certainly not a person who spends their every waking moment soaking themselves in signs and signals of the sort that cult studies people study; and it's partly, I suppose, because some of those signs and signals aren't worth bothering about. You have to be selective about these things.","This may sound insulting to some of my cult studies friends, but there's a lot of cult studies people who ignore, shall we say, the wider canvas - because they simply don't know about its existence or they don't know how it operates.","By the 1980s, practically no one under 60 in the real civilian world wore hats for anything except weddings, funerals or Ascot. Hats had been in competition with hair, and hair had won. Thirty years before that, Brits of all classes and ages wore hats all the time.","Stephen Jones' hats are what we used to call 'creations'; extravagant, odd things for extravagant, odd people like Madonna or Lady Gaga. They're worn in a parallel universe.","Girls like Diana Spencer, armed with nothing more than a guinea-pig-rearing certificate, proud to say in that old Sloane way that she was 'as thick as two short planks,' became the exception as girls from Benenden and Downe House started to fast-track towards the City and law, consultancy, media and the arts.","Been trading up recently? You have, haven't you? You'll be squawking that you're too rational, too busy and too socially concerned for any of that. But go through the fridge - come to think of it, what about the fridge itself? I bet it's bigger than its predecessor.","Haagen-Dazs (a clever Scandi-sounding name invented by Americans in 1961) was bought for its Euro-sounding sophistication by the kind of Americans who first bought those Mercs and Beemers, while Ben & Jerry's (now owned by Unilever) brought a post-hippy sensibility to bear. Buyers saw the brand as saying 'all-natural, organic and Fairtrade.'","Marmite - like that other little black-jar job, Bovril - is so much a Mark 1 staple-of-Empire brand, so much part of the Edwardian world of enamel advertising signs, the history of grin-and-bear-it industrial food.","Pop managers are fixed in the dramatic stock character repertoire too, ever since the first British pop film musical, Wolf Mankowitz's 'Expresso Bongo' of 1959, with Cliff Richard as Bongo Herbert and Laurence Harvey as his manager. The key components were cast as X parts gay, X parts Jewish and triple X opportunistic.","There are pop managers, and then there's Simon Cowell, who isn't gay, Jewish or particularly riveting. He's not without interest but he doesn't exactly have the hinterland of, say, Brian Epstein.","Nobody knows anything. I deal with people in all walks of life, some of whom should have some idea of what they're doing. And they're all clueless. It's astonishing that any bridges stay up, or that planes don't constantly plummet from the sky. It's heartening, in a strange way.","When I hear about something allegedly happening in the world I always ask: 'Who is doing it?' Trends break out because they're based on real demographics, like there being fewer nuclear families or more people living alone. If 10 people in Shoreditch are doing it, it's a 10-minute fad.","In the future, people will blame the Eighties for all societal ills in the same way that people have previously blamed the Sixties. The various Thatcherite Big Bangs - monetarism, deregulation, libertarianism - have been working their way through the culture ever since.","If you've done a bit of journalism, everyone assumes you must be moving into PR. We're absolutely not becoming a PR agency and we're not turning into Brunswick. We will remain SRU, but we will be owned by the Brunswick Group. It's quite different.","In Britain, eponymous lifestyle branding as we know it started in the late 1960s, with two fascinating families - the Conrans and the Ashleys - who in increasingly brilliant settings and catalogues sold rather different visions of what the new ideal upper-middle-y life looked like.","All brands, whether high-ticket luxury ones such as Cartier or Rolls-Royce or 'masstige' ones with luxe-y overtones but altogether more affordable, all want to grow. Even brands that may have started in a modestly niche design and lifestyle fashion can find themselves under pressure to go global or to sell out at the top.","Eponymous brands aren't that popular with analysts and investors now. You can only take an eponymous brand with a living figurehead so far, they argue. What happens when they grow old and die? What happens when they misbehave and go seriously off-brand?","There's no Peter York Foundation, and you're no one without one.","Tabloid discussion of bad children always blames baby-boomer liberals, careerist mothers and fashion-crazed Nathan Barley types who think it's all enormously funny. But the centre-leftish psycho-thinker Oliver James says it's all down to the Thatcher-and-after culture of turbo-capitalism, making people acquisitive and unsatisfied.","I can't actually read interviews with thesps now because they're almost always fantastically predictable, the men especially. Actors are forever stressing their ordinariness, their beer and football-loving commitments.","The newsprint thesp celebrity interview as a middle-brow art form suffers from desperate overproduction. There'll be at least 10 in the broadsheets today and every Sunday hereafter.","Celebrity poverty, that's the hidden scandal in Blair's Britain. You can't help but worry for them. A girl I knew developed X-ray eyes for celebrity sorrows. She taught me to read the subtext of the down-market celebrity interview, she knew all the Hollywood codes, and followed the deep backgrounds.","Brands are useful ways of short-handing practically anything - look at the way Tom Wolfe first used brand name lists to sharpen up a character and a situation. Look at the most brand-referenced novel, Bret Easton Ellis's 'Glamorama.'","All I'm saying is that Louis Vuitton and L'Oreal didn't invent branding at some point in the mid-Eighties. Big, reassuring names have been around a long time.","Across the Atlantic, commercial therapy of all kinds provides so many more comfortable outlets for people when they are under pressure. The English tradition is to get a grip, whereas the American version is to get in touch with your feelings, to say: 'I'm a good person. Isn't it terrible when bad things happen to people like me?'","The library was one more essential in the parade of rooms in a big 18th-century house - and part of the required kit ever afterwards. The important thing was to have the books, not actually read them.","Decorators never quite saw the point of massing books. Books brought colour to a room and filled it up, but shelves bearing just one thing struck them as a decorative display opportunity tragically lost.","Prince William looks good in uniform and Man-at-Hackett black and white tie (he has grown up wearing it constantly); less certain in his suits, which sometimes look borderline archaic; and variable in casual. But completely comfortable in the Sloane uniform of non-designer jeans and chocolate-brown suede loafers. He'll look fine in Boden.","Fashion people think that the careful Nice companies are boring beyond measure. (Nice people think fashionistas look silly and should Get A Life)."],"Peter Zumthor":["My relationship to plants becomes closer and closer. They make me quiet; I like to be in their company.","I work a little bit like a sculptor. When I start, my first idea for a building is with the material. I believe architecture is about that. It's not about paper, it's not about forms. It's about space and material.","What I try to do is the art of building, and the art of building is the art of construction; it is not only about forms and shapes and images.","If you look at the Earth without architecture, it's sometimes a little bit unpleasant. So there is this basic human need to do shelter in the broadest sense of the word, whether it's a movie theater or a simple log cabin in the mountains. This is the core of architecture: To provide a space for human beings.","Architecture has its place in the concrete world. This is where it exists. This is where it makes its statement.","You feel a certain way in a glass or concrete or limestone building. It has an effect on your skin - the same with plywood or veneer, or solid timber. Wood doesn't steal energy from your body the way glass and concrete steal heat. When it's hot, a wood house feels cooler than a concrete one, and when it's cold, the other way around.","Every time I imagine a garden in an architectural setting, it turns into a magical place. I think of gardens I have seen, that I believe I have seen, that I long to see, surrounded by simple walls, columns, arcades or the facades of buildings - sheltered places of great intimacy where I want to stay for a long time.","I am convinced that a good building must be capable of absorbing the traces of human life and taking on a specific richness... I think of the patina of age on materials, of innumerable small scratches on surfaces, of varnish that has grown dull and brittle, and of edges polished by use.","I think space, architectural space, is my thing. It's not about facade, elevation, making image, making money. My passion is creating space.","In a society that celebrates the inessential, architecture can put up a resistance, counteract the waste of forms and meanings and speak its own language.","The first 10 years of my professional life had only to do with running away from my father. He was a wonderful cabinet-maker, and me being the eldest son, I had to take over his shop, his profession and so on and so on. I tried to escape by going to art school and then going on to industrial design and then interior design.","My buildings should have an emotional core - a space which, in itself, has an emotional nice feeling.","Normally, architects render a service. They implement what other people want. This is not what I do. I like to develop the use of the building together with the client, in a process, so that as we go along we become more intelligent.","I think the chance of finding beauty is higher if you don't work on it directly. Beauty in architecture is driven by practicality. This is what you learn from studying the old townscapes of the Swiss farmers.","Designing is a matter of concentration. You go deep into what you want to do. It's about intensive research, really. The concentration is warm and intimate and like the fire inside the earth - intense but not distorted. You can go to a place, really feel it in your heart. It's actually a beautiful feeling.","If you're lucky, and a building succeeds, the real product has many more dimensions than you can ever imagine. You have the sun, the light, the rain, the birds, the feel.","I design for the use of a building and the place and for the people who use it... the reputation for arrogance comes because when work is offered to me, I look whether I can find a genuine interest in quality.","I can't be bought with money. If someone calls me and asks me to work for them for three or four years, and they'll pay me well to build their vacation home, I ask myself why I should work three or four years on something like that.","Small museums are great. Big museums are a drag.","Architecture to me is whole. I cannot say I only care about this 25% and the other 75% I let go... it's just I want to work the way I want to work. In my shop, you can order certain things and other things you cannot. They are not available.","Architecture is exposed to life. If its body is sensitive enough, it can assume a quality that bears witness to past life.","The bottom line may be that my inventing buildings is, indeed, a very private kind of activity. But it's done to be shared. It is comforting and consoling. From the reactions I get I can see I'm not doing something strange.","I need a close contact to the client, whoever it is, and a commitment of the client to go out and do a process together. I want to do the best for him. I need his respect and his patience. I want to work with a sophisticated person who's interested in a good building and not in my name.","There is still a real need for good quality architecture, not paper architecture, but the real stuff.","I grew up in a craftsman's home, where things were done with our own hands. I did cabinetmaking for four years and I hated it.","If, early on, you know how things are put together, then you can build. The architect is in charge of making - he is not an artist.","When I concentrate on a specific site or place for which I am going to design a building, I try to plumb its depths, its form, its history and its sensuous qualities.","I'm not mainly interested in what buildings mean as symbols or vehicles for ideas.","My first buildings, when I was about 30, were rejected for aesthetic reasons.","I've built two wooden houses near Vals. I built them for my wife. Those were private projects.","I work anywhere between three and 10 years on a project, depending on the size. My lifetime is finite. Therefore, I have to look carefully at how many projects I want to put into my lifetime.","If I look at history, it seems that most wars and most cruel things have been done by men and not by women."],"Petina Gappah":["There's a Shona saying: 'chakafukidza dzimba matenga' - 'What covers the home is the roof,' or 'Every home has its secrets.'","The prolific Chinodya has written a number of striking books, most notably 'Dew in the Morning', an exploration of an idyllic rural boyhood; the sophisticated 'Strife,' in which sins from the pre-colonial past cast shadows into the present; and the rich and varied short-story collection 'Can We Talk?'","I'm not even sure that I want to go back... The Zimbabwe that I really loved, the Zimbabwe that I grew up in, just isn't there anymore, and I'm not sure about the country that has replaced it.","The painful truth may be that Zimbabwe, the youngest of Africa's former colonies, has simply followed where the continent has led, treading the well-worn path beaten out of the lie that taking power from the colonialists and delivering democracy to the people are one and the same.","A novelist, poet and playwright who writes equally well in Shona and English, Charles Mungoshi is Zimbabwe's finest and most versatile writer. His life project has been to interrogate the notion of family.","I guess you could say I'm lucky because I've known a Zimbabwe that didn't have Robert Mugabe leading it. One of the saddest things about Zimbabwe is there are so many hidden casualties of the Mugabe government's misrule. They're not just casualties that you immediately see.","'Authentic' is one of my least favourite words because in such a diverse country, whose authenticity are you talking about?","My grandfather was a polygamous man, and he had two wives, and between him and his two wives, we are about 200 or so in our family.","Zimbabweans, I've come to believe, we are very passive-aggressive people. We don't like conflict; we don't like confrontation, so we find all sorts of ways of avoiding that conflict and confrontation. We are not allowed to talk about bad things that go on in families.","These are the kinds of names that Zimbabweans like: names that have positive qualities. Like, Praise is a very popular name; Loveness is a very popular name.","You could have names like Hatred; you could have names that mean something like Suffering or Poverty. So names are not just names: names have real meaning, and they tend to tell the world about the circumstances of your parents at the time that you were born.","I don't want to write because I have to; I want to write because I want to. Sometimes, when writers write because they have to, the results are disastrous.","If I truly had the courage of my convictions, I would be a full-blown comic novelist.","I get irritated by the term 'African writer', because it doesn't mean anything to me.","There are some people who are happy to be African writers. They are pan-Africanists. I'm not a pan-Africanist. I think African countries have a lot in common. But we are also very different.","What we are trying to do now, this new generation of African writers, is to write about what it is to be a human being living in a particular African country. These are stories that resonate with anyone, anywhere.","I speak English. I dream in it. I cannot separate my English from my Shona; I see the world with those two languages.","It was one of those early mid-life crises, really. I started asking myself, 'What is it that I want from my life?' This question kept haunting me: 'Do I want to be a lawyer who always wanted to be a writer, or do I actually want to be a writer?","Only al-Jazeera is allowed to report from Zimbabwe, but it is unwatchable. Their Zimbabwean reporter Supa Mandiwanzira was one of Zanu-PF's praise-singers at the reviled Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation.","Ian Smith thought his Rhodesia would last 1,000 years: it lasted less than 15.","The struggle for Zimbabwe lit up the imagination of people around the world. In London, New York, Accra and Lagos, bell-bottomed men and women with big hair and towering platform shoes sang the dream of Zimbabwe in the words of the eponymous song by Bob Marley: Every man has the right to decide his own destiny.","On April 18, 1980, the last outpost of empire in Africa died. From Rhodesia's ashes rose a country that would take its place among the free nations as Zimbabwe, the last among equals. And men and women leapt to embrace this dream called Zimbabwe.","I always say to people that Zimbabweans are the funniest people in Africa; we even laugh at funerals. And it's true. I mean, there are so many jokes about funerals. There are so many jokes about AIDS. We find ways of coping with pain by laughing at it and by laughing at ourselves.","People always ask me how I manage to find humor in so much bleakness. I think this is almost a necessary skill to have.","I was eight when independence happened. I remember my mum and dad getting dressed up to go to the independence concert to go listen to Bob Marley. Independence was such a wonderful time; we had so many expectations of the kind of country we would become. The vision of the government then was a wonderful vision.","The first thing I remember when I moved to a school in the suburbs was, 'My gosh, all these books!' The classroom and school had a library; I'd never seen so many books in my life! It was something we didn't have in the township.","For the first years of my life, I went to school in Rhodesia. My memory of living in the townships is that they were actually really happy places.","Zimbabwe is an unusual case study in African colonialism in that it was invaded by a private company under Royal Charter.","I see myself in public service in Zimbabwe. I would prefer an advisory role - cabinet secretary, minister of trade or the arts, or something like that. I don't want to be just a writer.","I was one of the first six black kids to integrate a formerly all-white school. I remember being looked at all the time and people laughing at my hair. I was also very self-conscious about the food I had for lunch. I had egg sandwiches, and the other mothers gave kids fancy stuff like bologna and Marmite. It took about a year to settle in.","I wonder why people commit crimes that are premeditated - to gain love, because of hatred, or for financial reasons.","I actually don't sleep much; I only need about four hours a night.","Publishing can be a cliquish and incestuous business; it is not uncommon for writers from the same agencies and publishers to review each other."],"Petra Collins":["My style motto is pretty classic: you give off a positive energy when you wear what you're most comfortable in.","I think the gender norms of emotion are horrendous. Being masculine means showing zero emotions, but having the choice to be angry or depressed. Being female means you are one dimensional - if you show more than that, you are a psycho, hysterical, or historically, a witch.","I've always been fascinated by the desert.","My lens and my personality, it's just fluid. The art isn't just in one place.","My favorite place to go is Zabriskie Point in Death Valley. If you see it at sunrise and sunset, it's like you're on Mars.","For me, art doesn't stop at the gallery space.","From the beginning of puberty, I did really badly in school. I was super dyslexic; I was in special ed. I had a hard time reading and writing, so I thought that my self worth was in my looks, how I presented myself, and how other people perceived me.","Occasionally, I'll wear glitter or blue eye shadow.","We work to create a new wave of feminism that is more inclusive. I want others to feel equal. It's so great to see women in positions of power, which is why other artists, such as Marilyn Minter, are so inspirational to me.","I didn't see spaces where female artists could exist and exhibit their work. So I created a platform for this - one that allowed our works to be seen, but to also weave a community of women that could lean on and work with one another.","I'm used to seeing women being degraded, slut shamed, harassed for what they look like. Even the most powerful women in the world are measured by their appearance and constantly ridiculed for it.","Social media has been such a big important thing for young artists and minorities because it's a community to get noticed. It's having an audience that was never there before.","I don't know what I would've done without it. I really struggled in school with reading and writing. Art was my refuge - my way of speaking, of dealing with my own issues and connecting with the world.","I look for subjects who have stories to tell - who are looking to tell something.","That's what I look for in models: Someone who can tell a story and has a presence in front of the camera.","When I was 16, I created this online platform for female artists. I messaged women who I loved; that's how I got work and connected with people. You don't need to plead for entry into a system that doesn't want you anyway.","The selfie is a powerful tool, but it can also be dangerous, and I am fascinated with the process of it because there is a level of self-monitoring.","Everyone has a mirror face that's so different from their natural face. And I think it's interesting, seeing the way people want to be viewed when they're putting themselves together.","Live what you support online; do things.","It's so important for women to create images of women - or any group, at that.","As a young woman, I was disturbed by the fact that there was no imagery that truly expressed the experience of a young woman and the challenges and turbulence we go through. All we had were teenage magazines like 'Cosmopolitan,' which are very one-sided and show an objectified view of women.","It's so rare to see a woman lose control and also gain it back. Women are always told, 'Oh, be in control of your feelings,' and a woman is never allowed to express her anger without being demonised as being PMS-y.","I know having a social media profile removed is a 21st century privileged problem - but it is the way a lot of us live. These profiles mimic our physical selves and a lot of the time are even more important. They are ways to connect with an audience, to start discussion, and to create change.","The selfie is revolutionary to me. It is, I think, the only point in history where masses of young girls and women have been able to control, create, and publish images of themselves.","With social media and all the new technology, there's just more interfaces around and reminders to constantly be working on our body.","I always had this feeling, what I wanted to do. I was trying to work out myself, my frustrations, my body. I couldn't really pinpoint. I started taking photos of my sister and her friends. I was 15, exploring what it meant to be a 15-year-old girl.","As much as I preach self-love, it's so hard for me to love myself. It's really hard, and it's just about building a good network of people and, in this case, a good network of artists. Trying to live your ideals as best as you can.","A thing that I'm always worried about doing is putting an image of myself on my Instagram or somewhere else that looks perfect, because that's not who I am, and that's not what I want to preach.","I'm so pro-selfie because I think it's a tool that allows girls to create images of their own and of themselves.","Curating, in the modern sense, is something I gravitate to. Taking different ideas from a bunch of different places and putting them into one place or space, a story that makes sense or a new idea. Everything is remixed and taken from other things to make something new.","Just being with a group of girls and experiencing sadness together - it's a pretty powerful thing.","My mom had been a script supervisor in Hungary, but you can't just jump into that in Canada without knowing any English. She worked retail jobs and raised my sister and me while learning English.","Oh my God. Brian De Palma. I love him.","I'm definitely a Sagittarius. I'm such a fire sign.","I'm used to being told by society that I must regulate my body to fit the norm. I'm used to the fact that images of unaltered women are seen as unacceptable.","I consider myself endlessly lucky to have access to the Internet and technology. Through it, I've found myself and have been able to join a new discourse of females, young and old, who strive to change the way we look and treat ourselves.","It's very insulting when you're in charge and someone is talking down to you.","Being taken seriously as a young woman is the biggest hurdle as I grow older.","I'm very lucky that I'm not a photographer for hire - people hire me for me. I go into every commercial work with an art focus, with that lens; every brand I've worked for just lets me do whatever I want to do. I have full creative freedom.","How girls perceive themselves is interesting, and how they act when they're looking in the mirror.","For me, being in a car listening to music has always been my one spot to think.","It's just so humanizing to see someone be real.","A good jean that fits someone's butt right is just amazing. It's just classic.","I want people to see themselves in a person. I never want someone to aspire to be someone else.","When you see stories about women that aren't being told by women, it can make you feel like you don't exist.","I think it's important for not just me but women of color, trans women, and people who are marginalized to be telling stories of themselves. It's important for us to be behind the lens.","People are always like, 'Did you purposely do something to make people uncomfortable?' And I say the reason why it's uncomfortable is because it's either something that we can't talk about or aren't supposed to talk about, and they're images that aren't ever seen.","Just like any other girl, I felt pressure to look a certain way. Act a certain way.","I really don't believe in the word 'selling out.'","I get why feminism can be intimidating; sometimes it can seem like this exclusive club.","Hashtag activism is a catalyst, but things have to actually happen in real life.","I was very depressed at a young age and felt like I didn't have agency towards that. Being 'female' meant I couldn't be that - I couldn't be angry, loud, sullen. Being sad meant I was weak.","When a woman is anything but pleasant, she is labeled as whiny, hysterical, etc.","I love working in groups - I think it makes each individual more powerful.","There's definitely a romanticism of youth, like, everywhere. Specifically with women, they kind of only exist between the age of 15 to 25.","I really wanted to feel strong, I wanted my subjects to feel strong, but I didn't know how to do that. It's really hard for, I guess, every woman to not internalize misogyny. I just learned as I went on how to best capture my subjects without objectifying them.","If your story is being told by someone who doesn't really know it, it's not going to come out accurate. A lot of it has to do with context. Whoever's behind the camera or pen or whatever.","You don't have to wait for anyone's approval to do things.","You don't have to try to get a job and go through set steps before you start a career or start your life. That's what I want young girls to know - you can do anything you want. Just start.","My mind is changing all the time. I can't live in a space that has a fixed aesthetic. I just need a blank slate when I come home.","If I have extra money, I always love to support my friends who're making art.","I'm either working or I'm lying in bed the entire day.","Women's emotions are constantly labeled. Any slight deviation from 'pleasantness,' and we are labeled as hysterical. When we are angry, sad, depressed, or manic, we are immediately seen as unfeminine or ugly or weak.","My mother struggled immensely with mental illness, and so did I. She grew up bipolar, but it was never diagnosed nor recognized. It was shrugged off like a 'symptom' of being female - of her being weak. I also experienced this growing up: I felt that the great pain I experienced was a dramatisation.","I was depressed at a very young age - mental illness runs in my family, especially on the female side.","We live in such an image-heavy world that not seeing yourself in that landscape can really make it tough to feel human, to feel like you are part of the world.","I think a way that feminist photographers work is turning what was the object into the subject and really making it our own.","I'm thin and white and blond, but I'm not an airbrushed, perfect thing. I have stretch marks all over. I have cellulite; I have acne. To me, it feels like you can't really be what you can't see, and so if you don't see those things, then you don't feel like you're valid.","I think being collaborative is definitely more natural for people who are minorities in any sense - so people who aren't, like, white male artists - because we don't have the privilege to create art and work alone, usually.","Art was - and is - my biggest outlet. I'd probably die if I didn't do it.","Because I loved dance, I always need to be physical and moving, so photography that is more tactile made more sense.","On film, you really have to focus on what you're looking at. You're imprinting a physical image.","I didn't really have an identity crisis because I really, really knew who I always wanted to be But I definitely had a lot of problems with my body. I was very skinny, and I guess my body was sort of pre-pubescent, but when I grew hips and thighs, I just didn't know where I was in the world. It was weird.","We have this weird beauty standard where women, like, shouldn't grow: what we think is feminine is often what is also pre-pubescent.","Women are inherently told their bodies are objects, so that's how we treat them.","I just think it's crazy that we don't think that the youth are valid. They're the ones who really know what's going on.","I grew up on Facebook; it's a different realm I live in. For some people, this is inauthentic, but for me, it's all I know.","Feminism is a lens I see the world through and what I believe in. I don't ever use it as a tool of promotion.","When I do an editorial or when I do a campaign, I bring that lens to every space.","I'm obviously a white woman with privilege. I want to make sure I always collaborate with people who aren't like me so we can create a work that isn't one dimensional.","I want to direct a feature film. Horror is my main genre.","I remember being 12 or 13 and reading 'Seventeen' and 'CosmoGirl.' They were all about self-improvement.","I did two years at art school in criticism and curatorial practice, but I dropped out because I was frustrated that there was this hierarchy where I couldn't do anything or ask questions.","Success doesn't happen overnight.","The feminist movement is way bigger than the word. I don't police people on what they call themselves, but equality and a general sense of togetherness are really important to me.","It's hard for every girl to accept their body. This is something that I try to work on every day to set a good example.","I keep this Hungarian wooden candlestick on the top of my refrigerator along with all my other candles. It's big and ugly, especially next to all my pretty candles, and it doesn't really make sense to have in my apartment.","I came to New York with no money and just one suitcase. I had my family's emotional support, but they weren't able to help me financially.","When I was growing up, my parents would apologize when we didn't have enough money for something. I'd always tell them that it was O.K. and that I had learned to work hard because of them.","What's cool is when people send me messages or tag me in their photos, which definitely happens more after a project comes out. The best part, I think, is that the DMs and tags are always from young girls, and reaching them is the most important thing for me.","I post all the time anyway. It's part of who I am. There's me IRL. There's me URL. That's just my life. Plus, I love it. It's amazing to connect with so many people.","I think anytime you can share images that make young women feel a sense of belonging when they might not be feeling their best or their strongest is so cool.","Putting your work out there is scary!","I started out taking photos of my friends on, like, disposable cameras, and I documented my younger sister and her friends all through high school.","I approach beauty the same way I approach clothing - I think people should do whatever to themselves to make them feel more comfortable in their skin.","I wish I didn't think about what my body looks like. It can be done - it's just a long process.","People look the best when they feel the most comfortable, so I buy 10 of the same thing if I really like it."],"Petra Haden":["Old film-noir movies. There's something comforting about watching black-and-white movies, and hearing this kind of music just puts me in a fantasy world. It's a really great escape for me.","I remember watching Looney Tunes cartoons and having the music stuck in my head.","The bass line is the anchor for me. I started with the bass, and either doubled that and then added the harmonies, or sometimes added my own harmonies that I've always wanted to sing on the song. And then it just went on from there - singing violin parts and trumpet parts and just trying to emulate the sounds of the instruments.","I wish I finished music school, because then I feel like I could talk more about the dissonant notes.","'The Conversation' was a movie I saw probably for the first time in the early 2000s. I immediately loved the piano and just how simple it is.","I like things that start depressing and dark and end up romantic, and that's what I really loved about 'King Kong.'","When I was recording my first solo album 'Imaginaryland,' I was listening to a lot of movie scores.","I always related my favorite music to the movies.","That's what I love about those old movies - the music is like a constant companion. Even in scenes that aren't particularly dramatic, like a woman checking her watch, you hear the music as a comment on that action."],"Petra Kelly":["If there is a future, it will be Green.","We, the generation that faces the next century, can add the solemn injunction 'If we don't do the impossible, we shall be faced with the unthinkable.'"],"Petra Nemcova":["We cannot stop natural disasters but we can arm ourselves with knowledge: so many lives wouldn't have to be lost if there was enough disaster preparedness.","I can dance for, like, four or five hours nonstop without even drinking water. It's a beautiful, beautiful thing.","Learn from the past, look to the future, but live in the present.","There are lots of things which I would love to tell him, but in some way, I also feel that I lost the person closest to me. And I got a second chance to live. So in a way I feel that I live for both of us... and I will do my best.","I think all women want to feel sexy and confident yet comfortable at the same time in what they wear.","My secret passion is motorbikes. I want a Kawasaki Ninja.","If we focus on the minuses, we go down the spiral. But if we are able to focus on the pluses, we can become stronger and put more meaning into our life.","So, we have choice, and sometimes it seems very hard, but the best way to heal physically or emotionally is to keep positive.","I grew up under Communism so we could only learn Russian, and then when Communism fell in 1989 we could learn a few more things and have the freedom to travel and the freedom of speech - and the freedom of dreaming, really.","I was so afraid to even read a paper in front of my classmates. It is very funny because at that point my teachers would never have believed that I could speak in front of an audience of over 2,000 people.","I talk to Simon, I write to him. I never used to write a diary. But now I'm writing a diary to him. I think it's not just me, but lots of others, family and friends, can still feel him around.","I love to dance.","I've learned a couple of things. And one of the things I have learned is that every experience has pluses and minuses.","I used to work all the time, and now if there is a wedding, there's a concert, I'm there.","It's usually when the cameras leave that the support leaves as well."],"Petra Stunt":["I love accessories. I'm a girl. I love shoes. I love handbags.","My grandmother worked on a fruit and vegetable market stall.","I'm a hard-working girl. I go to the office. I work a normal 9 to 5 job most days.","My mom came from such humble beginnings and especially my dad as well. He didn't go to university.","My dad has worked so hard his whole life. He doesn't deserve to see his daughters going out embarrassing themselves and flashing their knickers. I want to make my parents proud.","I am suspicious of what people might want from me. Do they like me, or my money?","So in some ways my life, my background has been isolating and I think I'm a bit more scared as a person. I don't walk alone or in the dark. If I go out the driver will wait for me to go into the house.","At the end of the day, I don't need to work, and I think it's good that I have the drive and willpower to get up and do something in the morning even though I don't need to.","No one ever talks about the good in me; they just say that I'm spoiled.","My parents were very well-off, but we didn't have a crazy-huge house. We didn't have thousands of workers and staff; it was just my mum doing the majority of the housework. We didn't have nannies. I wasn't brought up in any sort of extravagant way.","I realize I am very privileged. But there's a difference between being spoiled and privileged.","Before getting meningitis, I was such a hypochondriac, worrying about the slightest ache. Ironically, I overlooked meningitis because the symptoms seemed like flu. I guess you don't realise how healthy you are until it is taken away from you."],"Petrarch":["True, we love life, not because we are used to living, but because we are used to loving. There is always some madness in love, but there is also always some reason in madness.","Five enemies of peace inhabit with us - avarice, ambition, envy, anger, and pride; if these were to be banished, we should infallibly enjoy perpetual peace.","How difficult it is to save the bark of reputation from the rocks of ignorance.","It is more honorable to be raised to a throne than to be born to one. Fortune bestows the one, merit obtains the other.","Suspicion is the cancer of friendship.","There is no lighter burden, nor more agreeable, than a pen.","The aged love what is practical while impetuous youth longs only for what is dazzling.","Man has no greater enemy than himself.","Love is the crowning grace of humanity, the holiest right of the soul, the golden link which binds us to duty and truth, the redeeming principle that chiefly reconciles the heart to life, and is prophetic of eternal good.","Often have I wondered with much curiosity as to our coming into this world and what will follow our departure.","To begin with myself, then, the utterances of men concerning me will differ widely, since in passing judgment almost every one is influenced not so much by truth as by preference, and good and evil report alike know no bounds.","A short cut to riches is to subtract from our desires.","Books have led some to learning and others to madness.","And tears are heard within the harp I touch.","Do you suppose there is any living man so unreasonable that if he found himself stricken with a dangerous ailment he would not anxiously desire to regain the blessing of health?","Rarely do great beauty and great virtue dwell together.","What name to call thee by, O virgin fair, I know not, for thy looks are not of earth And more than mortal seems thy countenances.","Who naught suspects is easily deceived.","Sameness is the mother of disgust, variety the cure.","To be able to say how much love, is love but little.","How fortune brings to earth the over-sure!"],"Petter Stordalen":["What makes the world such a wonderful place is the diversity. I have always strived to fill my home, my office and my hotels with the most diverse crowds possible.","What is good for society is also good for business.","It's super important that people use their significant buying power to pull companies like Ferrari and show them there is a market for sustainable fuel. So many other car companies would take notice if Ferrari made headway on this measure.","Wealthy people don't even pay taxes. But everybody must pay taxes.","It doesn't matter how rich you are - you know when you're being ripped off.","I want to see a capitalism that manages resources in a new, much more long-term manner."],"Petula Clark":["In some ways, I've always approached singing as acting, and the voice is just like a way of carrying the song.","There are definitely people who are stuck in the '60s and there are definitely people who think I am and it's just not true. I was performing for a long time before the '60s and I'll be doing exciting interesting things for along time to come."],"PewDiePie":["My parents said that sitting at home playing video games all day won't bring you anywhere in life.","With my channel, and what people associate with Internet, most people think it goes viral, you become this huge thing super quick. I never had an explosion or a huge thing. It's just been something that has progressively been growing. It's been building.","When I started my YouTube channel in 2010, I never imagined that one day it would be the most subscribed channel in the world and that I would be a part of such a great community.","Comments are my main way to communicate with you bros.","I don't do interviews.","I'm just so very lucky to be able to do what I do for a living, and giving back is a way for me to express my gratitude. I'm so lucky to be in a position to help people, and that's appealing to me.","In the very few interviews I've made, it doesn't matter how long we've talked to each other, the headline is still just about my paycheck.","I often get recognized on the street.","The thing that has made YouTube so successful is that you can relate to the people you're watching to a much higher degree than to the people you see on TV.","I just want to entertain; that is my main objective and what comes before everything else.","Everyone has played video games at some point these days, and video games are fun.","I make funny videos of me playing video games, and I share those moments.","When there's just so many games out there to play, Nintendo games just went to the bottom of that list.","I'd like to help other YouTubers.","Save the Children is an awesome charity that has helped more than 125 million children around the world, providing everything from school books to food to blankets and shelter.","It was so much easier to connect with my fans when I was smaller. I could answer every message, and I enjoyed doing that.","What I and other YouTubers do is a very different thing; it's almost like hanging around and watching your pal play games.","The fact that Disney bought Maker Studios doesn't really change anything for me.","I'm so central to YouTube now, and that puts me in the spotlight and raises a lot of questions like, 'Why is he so big?'","I just want to connect with you bros. That's all I care about, because you bros' support really means everything to me.","Dropping the news to my parents that I was skipping my 'dream education' at Chalmers to sit at home recording videos while playing video games was not easy.","I'm not out to max my income. I think my viewers would call me on that right away if I did."],"Peyton Manning":["My closest friends are from my high school days.","I get asked a lot about my legacy. For me, it's being a good teammate, having the respect of my teammates, having the respect of the coaches and players. That's important to me.","I understand the seriousness of concussions.","I pray every night, sometimes long prayers about a lot of things and a lot of people, but I don't talk about it or brag about it because that's between God and me, and I'm no better than anybody else in God's sight.","Don't ever think, no matter how old you are, that you don't need to be coached.","I didn't play organized football until I was in the seventh grade. Up until that point, I only played at recess and in the backyard.","The word 'embarrassing' is an insulting word, to tell you the truth.","I feel like I've improved at everything I've done every single year - except golf. Golf, I've managed to stay exactly the same.","Times change, circumstances change, and that's the reality of playing in the NFL.","I was talking to my good friend Kid Rock a while ago, and he told me if I'd send him a helmet, he'd send me an autographed platinum record. I thought that was a pretty sweet swap.","When I was drafted by the Colts, Indianapolis was a basketball and a car racing town, but it didn't take long for the Colts to convert the city and state of Indiana into football evangelists.","I revere football. I love the game. You don't have to wonder if I will miss it. I will absolutely miss it.","Life is not shrinking for me; it's morphing into a whole new world of possibilities.","There are other players who were more talented, but there is no one who could out-prepare me.","Nobody really wants to hear about anybody else's injuries. Or how your back feels. Whose back doesn't hurt?","You hear about how many fourth quarter comebacks that a guy has and I think it means a guy screwed up in the first three quarters.","I've learned a lot from my mistakes, stumbles, and losses in football.","I committed my life to Christ, and that faith has been most important to me ever since.","You certainly know when you have an opportunity, and you want to take advantage of it. And it's certainly disappointing when you don't.","If nothing else in life, I want to be true to the things I believe in, and quite simply, to what I'm all about. I know I'd better, because it seems whenever I take a false step or two I feel the consequences.","I think I could describe the perfect quarterback. Take a little piece of everybody. Take John Elway's arm, Dan Marino's release, maybe Troy Aikman's drop-back, Brett Favre's scrambling ability, Joe Montana's two-minute poise and, naturally, my speed.","I've tried to keep myself out of bad situations, and if that means I'm a Goody Two-shoes, so be it.","I never thought 'Sodapop Curtis' would announce my retirement. I always thought I would be the one to announce it. I'm a huge fan of the movie, but that caught me way off guard. I can't explain it.","I have been tremendously impacted and influenced by my coaches. It's nice to play for people that are going to support you.","Pressure is something you feel when you don't know what the hell you're doing.","Football's been such a part of my life. It's allowed me to meet so many people and do so many things.","If any other part of your body has some weakness, you go, 'Well I can probably manage.' But when you're a quarterback, and it's your right hand, you're certainly concerned far as being able to do your job.","When you take a year off from football, you come back for all the enjoyable moments. When you're not playing, you miss out on all the highs, but you also miss these disappointments. But I would rather be in the arena to be excited or be disappointed than not have a chance at all. That's football. That's why everybody plays it.","Everybody is going to be excited to play in a Super Bowl. When you still enjoy the preparation and the work part of it, I think you ought to be still doing that. I think as soon as I stop enjoying it, if I can't produce, if I can't help a team, that's when I will stop playing.","The one year the Lord took my greatest physical gift, he gave me the greatest gift you could have in children. So that was a real equalizer. And I would take that trade any day of the week.","It goes without saying, winning against a good team in a hostile crowd on the road, it's just an absolutely huge win.","I've been being asked about my legacy since I was about 25 years old. I'm not sure you can have a legacy when you're 25 years old. Even 37. I'd like to have to be, like, 70 to have a legacy. I'm not even 100 percent sure what the word even means.","I'll always be a Colt. I always will be. That'll never change.","You certainly miss a lot of things about Indianapolis. I miss a lot of friends in Indy. St. Elmo's. The Slippery Noodle. Amalfi's.","Growing up in New Orleans as Archie Manning's son, I felt like a target, and I've always known that whatever I'd do, people would hear about it. So I've had my guard up, and maybe that's molded my personality.","I was truly honored to be a part of that game, to be playing the 50th Super Bowl.","A man's got to know his limitations.","When you play for 20 years - and really, I never had to miss a game due to injury - that's not just good protection. That's good luck.","I'm the best Manning.","Imitation is obviously a great form of flattery.","I don't want to retire. I still want to play.","The head coach tells us what to do, and we follow his orders.","Some people have this impression of me: 'Boy, he's always so serious on the field. Football. Football. Football.'","I'd like people to understand that I do have some personality.","Some guys leave a place after a long time, and they're bitter. Not me.","I have to leave the games now if the announcer says something I don't agree with. I'm thinking, 'Peyton, it is not healthy to be all worked up before a game.'","I would love to have played in the '60s. Now that would have been fun.","My dad told us up front, 'Guys, if you want to play sports, go ahead, but it's your decision.'","I am stronger than I was last year. I am throwing the ball better now in May of 2013 than I did in May of 2012 - significantly better. I got better throughout the season.","You can play pickup basketball, but you can't really re-create football.","My high-school coach Tony Reginelli was kind of famous for 'Reggie-isms,' kind of like 'Yogi-isms.' He always said if you want to be a good quarterback, when sprinting left you want to be amphibious and throw left-handed. I told him, 'You mean ambidextrous, coach?'","I guess, to tell you the truth, I've never had much of a desire to grow facial hair. I think I've managed to play quarterback just fine without a mustache.","When you go through a significant injury and have a major career change, you truly do go one year at a time, and you don't look past what's going on now, because you are not sure what's going to happen. Tomorrow is not promised.","Everyone should play like Adrian Peterson. This guy does everything full speed. Pro Bowl - promoting himself for MVP.","It truly has been an honor to play in Indianapolis. I do love it here. I love the fans, and I will always enjoy having played for such a great team.","I've been a Colt for almost all of my adult life, but I guess in life, and in sports, we all know nothing lasts forever. Times change, circumstances change, and that's the reality of playing in the NFL.","My advice to the next quarterback that misses an entire year is to understand there is a little difference going out on the road again. You miss that. When you're hurt, you do not feel like you are part of it.","Each game in the postseason has its own identity.","I'll even miss the Patriots fans in Foxborough, and they should miss me, because they sure did get a lot of wins off of me.","There's no way to measure or properly express what a family like mine can mean. Mom, Dad, Cooper, Eli, extended family, you are the best.","'Grateful' is the word that comes to my mind when thinking of the Denver Broncos.","I'm retiring as a football player from the University of Tennessee who played for the Colts and the Broncos and was very lucky to have played for all of them.","The finger lick is just a really bad habit - I do it all the time. My wife Ashley is going to kill me if I do it at dinner one more time. I look like an animal about to dig in.","I've never played, on the field, any other position besides quarterback. Never been on a special team. Never been on defense.","I do vote. I have voted ever since I've been eligible to vote.","I think e-mail is kind of a cheap way to communicate. It's a lazy way of writing a letter, you know. I write a letter every now and then, you know, pick out somebody and drop them a line, because I always like receiving letters.","I don't believe I throw quite the same as before I was injured.","Quarterbacks coach, I would do at Tennessee. Head coach? Absolutely not.","I enjoy teaching football.","I'm totally convinced that the end of my football career is just the beginning of something I haven't even discovered yet.","One of the things about football is, it's a relationship business.","I cherished my time playing high school sports.","I've put a lot of thought into being a leader.","I don't believe in having a separate workout for quarterbacks. Other players hate that.","In my very first NFL game, I completed my first pass to Hall of Fame running back Marshall Faulk.","I want to thank the people of New Orleans and south Louisiana. New Orleans is my hometown, and of course they support their own team, the Saints, but they also support their own, and that city and state have backed me from the start.","Over my NFL career, I've had five head coaches who have helped me become better at my craft and have helped me become a better human being: Jim Mora, Tony Dungy, Jim Caldwell, John Fox, Gary Kubiak."],"Peyton Reed":["I hate when there's a deleted scene on a DVD with no explanation, or you have to go out of your way to find an alternate audio track.","I've always been a DVD geek and, before that, a laser disc fanatic, too.","I came from a background of directing behind-the-scenes documentaries.","I think there's actually a benefit to working with teen actors: they've got such boundless energy, and everybody is willing to try different things.","As a Marvel fan who grew up with 'The Avengers' and 'Ant-Man' and everything, I definitely have my own sort of feelings about what I want to see as a fan in an 'Ant-Man' movie.","You cannot separate sexuality from cheerleading. It is inherently what it is - growing up with the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders and all of that stuff.","What I loved about 'The 40 Year-Old Virgin,' the title is the easy sell, but when you see the movie, the comedy is more free-form and more relatable.","I think with any movie, the more you know, it loses some of its power.","When you look at Kennedy and Nixon, TV played a crucial part in Kennedy's popularity. He was incredibly photogenic, while Nixon was this scowling figure. American viewers judged him on his appearance on TV.","I forgive 'Face in the Crowd' its uneven tone because it's precisely what makes it feel unlike other Kazan movies.","Maybe I have an affinity for Andy Griffith because we both grew up in North Carolina.","'A Face in the Crowd' is Elia Kazan's forgotten movie.","I love turning on the computer in the morning and reading the things that I did the day before - that I didn't do!","I always loved as a kid reading 'Spider-Man,' and the 'Fantastic Four' would show up... it was all about that larger universe."],"Phaedrus":["Things are not always as they seem; the first appearance deceives many.","Gentleness is the antidote for cruelty.","Those who plot the destruction of others often perish in the attempt.","Whoever is detected in a shameful fraud is ever after not believed even if they speak the truth.","The humble are in danger when those in power disagree.","In outward show so splendid and so vain; 'tis but a gilded block without a brain.","An alliance with a powerful person is never safe.","The mind ought sometimes to be diverted that it may return to better thinking.","Everyone is bound to bear patiently the results of his own example.","The bow kept taut will quickly break, kept loosely strung, it will serve you when you need it.","Everyone ought to bear patiently the results of his own conduct.","Submit to the present evil, lest a greater one befall you.","In a change of masters the poor change nothing except their master's name.","I would rather not be a king than to forfeit my liberty.","It is the part of a fool to give advice to others and not himself to be on his guard.","Witticisms please as long as we keep them within boundaries, but pushed to excess they cause offense.","Success tempts many to their ruin.","A learned man has always riches in himself.","Strangers he gulls, but friends make fun of him.","That only is a disgrace to a man which he has deserved to suffer.","The intelligence of few perceives what has been carefully hidden in the recesses of the mind."],"Pham Nhat Vuong":["Vietnamese are very similar to the Chinese. They just can't sit on gold bars underneath their beds. Eventually, they will pull out their gold bars and invest.","We want to bring better products to Vietnam. My hope is through changes in lifestyle and the products we consume, it will affect the people and change the way they are thinking.","Attacking is better than defending."],"Phaneesh Murthy":["Somebody once told me that self-punishment is worse than any other punishment.","I'm lucky because I have the ability to look at the brighter side of life.","Lot of companies are looking for advisory work on business strategy, restructuring work.","I have met so many people who are negative, and it tells on their attitude towards life and towards everything."],"Pharrell Williams":["Right now, musically I'm inspired by everyday people.","I love when things are transparent, free and clear of all inhibition and judgement.","Everything that we experience every day leaves a long-lasting impression.","It's not possible to experience constant euphoria, but if you're grateful, you can find happiness in everything.","Some people say there's nothing new under the sun. I still think that there's room to create, you know. And intuition doesn't necessarily come from under this sun. It comes from within.","The simplest way to say it is that I think we're all dealt these cards in life, but the cards in and of themselves don't read one way or the other. It's up to you to home in and cultivate whatever you've got in your hand.","My ideal travel companions are my family.","The element of harmony is super important.","I'm always consciously trying to make what I feel is missing.","I'm like a little boy from Virginia. I'm a backpacker. In my head, I'm left of centre. I come from the pool of weirdoes.","My favorite Dominican dish to indulge in is anything with crab.","The keyboard is my journal.","'Entrepreneur 'just denotes that you recognize that you're doing things across disciplines and that you're blazing your own path.","I love when things are transparent, free and clear of all inhibition and judgment.","I am overly ambitious, because I realize it can be done.","The more I can make a person comfortable in their environment by taking my ego's hat off and leaving it at the door, then they can dive deep within themselves and we can pull out something interesting that people have never heard before. It's the stuff that's - that no one's ever heard before is really interesting.","Fashion is more about feel than science.","Some of us get a feeling when we hear music and we feel music, and you want to figure out how to continue to feel that.","You can't get anything done hanging out all day long.","I'm a producer. I'm a musician. And my job is to come in and, you know, put - you know, I treat all of the artists that I work with, like, you know, the way da Vinci was looking at Mona Lisa, you know, there's an interesting backdrop.","You treat the air as a canvas and the paint is the chords that come through your fingers, out of the keyboard.","I just like being a kid. I enjoy it, I don't want to grow up.","I learn a lot from my experiences and collaborations. Most of my collaborations are meant for me to learn.","You sort of have to become what you're wearing.","I'm like most people. We just concentrate on the present. I live right where the film is going through the film projector and it hits the light.","So when I'm playing, I'm sort of painting a feeling in the air.","I think all music is a gift from God.","Living your life 40 floors up, looking out every day on ocean and skies, you see the world from a different point of view. It's like living in a very interesting fishbowl, but since no one can see up here, it's like a fishbowl with a limo tint.","I'm just very thankful. And I say that a lot because that's the most important message.","Alber Elbaz is just a genius. He'll be in a dinner jacket and he doesn't care what time of day it is: I love that about him. He just marches to the beat of his own drum.","I don't know about style mistakes.","Most of the time, I see what I see, I search my feelings, and then I make my decisions based on my gut - and I don't always make the right ones.","You don't know what people are looking for. What you know is what you feel like might be missing. It's up to the people to agree with you or disagree with you, and you'll know in their reaction.","Lyrically, I could be so much sharper. Melodically, I could be so much stickier. Musically, I could have so much more texture. So I'm constantly doing that, trying to find new ways to mix things up.","I have an all-Japanese design team, and none of them speak English. So it's often funny and surprising how my ideas end up lost in translation.","I can't say what I'm going to wear all the time. The minute that I say that, then there's something in me that tips off and then I need to break out of that.","I wanted clothing that I couldn't find, so I decided to make it.","When you're playing, you're playing something for the world to hear.","When you're dancing, you're dancing for people to see.","The sexiest woman musician is Alicia Keys.","I just do what I do. It's not something that should be revered as something that's great.","I love what I do, I love my job.","You get used to it when you feel like you're an artist.","I love making music, though. I love playing.","I just happen to admire everyone that we work with.","I don't want to end up being a circus act, doing my most famous tricks when I'm 70.","There's no better feeling than just going in and just working with someone and what comes out is something that the world knows about.","I love playing. The keyboard is my journal.","I don't know, the artist thing is not me. I love making music, though.","I think music follows the trends of the collective conscious.","Music is all of a sudden much more colorful.","Remember my first tenet in getting dressed is how you feel in the morning. So if you're not being true blue to that, it usually shows.","I only entertain very close friends.","I like anything sweet.","I love everything that Frank Gehry does. I wish I could have that man build me a Wayne Manor-style mansion, like his idea of it.","I answer questions the best I can.","My style hero was' Batman.' Now it's Tony Stark.","I like the world.","I love the way Charlize Theron and Kate Moss dress.","When I'm in the mood for room service, my favorite order is a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich.","When it comes to luggage, I am an underpacker.","I like to browse and just hang in bookstores.","The people have allowed me to - they've respected my choice of wanting to be like, a little, you know, a baby alchemist, and just trying to mix different cultures together and things that I think are interesting.","Iconic artists are never straight ahead. Michael Jackson loved Elvis and Burt Bacharach, and uniquely blended both of them into what he did.","I'm a fan of music, first and foremost. So I do things from the perspective of a fan.","For me, nothing is given."],"Phebe Novakovic":["The Virginia class is an extremely successful program, and we'd like to keep it that way, and we're confident in our performance. But the Ohio replacement is a significantly larger ship.","We are not going to compete for programs where we do not believe we can get a fair and sufficient return.","Chasing revenues that don't have good earnings doesn't help us or shareholders one lick."],"Phife Dawg":["A Tribe Called Quest was one of those things where it was supposed to be about growth. When I say 'growth,' I don't just mean with our sound or our product, but Tribe was supposed to grow as individuals.","Yeah, me and Q-Tip is cool outside of the business, but you know, within the business sometimes it can get ugly, you know what I mean?","I didn't really know what to expect, but I thought there aren't a lot of rap groups that can say they have a documentary done about them, so my attitude was like, 'Shoot, why not?' I'm sure there are a lot of people that would like to take our place. I felt like we should all embrace it.","When I hear the word 'documentary,' I don't think certain things should be left out. You've got to keep it 100 percent as much as you can, unless your group has a meeting beforehand and says, 'Yo - don't say this, 'cause boom, boom, boom.' Other than that, it's a documentary so let's document, you know what I mean?","London is one of my favourite places to come to overseas.","I'm all about the fans.","I'm doing a fun EP. It's called 'Songs in the Key of Phife: Eight Is Enough.' It's radio-friendly, but then a lot of it just has that raw hip-hop. Some of it will be vintage Tribe, but for the most part I'm just letting my voice be heard.","I emcee how I feel for the moment. I'll always be influenced by Tribe, but my EP and LP have a lot of different flavors! I'll keep it vintage Tribe if Tribe decides to do another LP... which, in my heart, I'd love to do for the fans."],"Phil Anselmo":["You gotta look beyond the mainstream... the mainstream'll drown you, you know? There's always a pulse in the underground that I love. And the pulse in the underground is what keeps heavy metal alive.","You can only exist as far as your mind will allow you to exist, and I think chronic pain will stop time dead in its tracks. You feel like you're the only one, and how unfair it is, and a million different feel-sorry-for-yourself type feelings.","Music is there for us to explore. To intentionally limit yourself to one, two, or three genres is limitation at its worst. Music is huge; it's a gigantic history lesson, and if you are true music fan or a musician, you should explore it. It's all right there in front of us.","At least in my life, I cannot hold onto grudges. It's a waste of energy, a waste of time.","Pantera revolutionized the sound and the approach to heavy metal. It's been regurgitated. Once you up the production on a product and not just the playing but the actual production, then it's going to up the ante.","It seems like if you are not painted up special way or have some tailor made outfit to put on to go out on stage... I don't know... there's too much of it out there.","I guess I've never been introduced properly to Pink Floyd. I know they're great, don't get me wrong. Excellent, excellent musicians; great band; awesome harmony; great song writers; I just don't know anything besides, I guess, the popular songs on the radio.","You're always going to have detractors, and you're always going to have people who love you, and that's how it's perfectly balanced and the world spins on.","I went from being a kid-kid, listen to everything from The Beatles through Kiss, Peter Frampton, Jethro Tull classic rock, classic stuff into immediately, it seemed like, Iron Maiden and stuff like that. The first Iron Maiden record and then, obviously, the first Metallica record.","With this LP we were all very clear on the approach we wanted to take, which was to do something heavy, but also experiment with a lot of other things we really like.","We definitely have a hardcore following.","To me, I'm for a band whose forefront is the music.","This is the band I always wanted to be in.","There it is again. Image. Once again. I get really tired of it quick.","I wasn't that wild about that. I told them basically if they were really going to want to bring back heavy metal to a program on MTV, then they are really going to have to get in touch with what real heavy metal is.","I can easily say I've done everything I've wanted in music.","And it seems to be today, image is a real important thing once again.","I'm glowing in the dark with my studio tan. I've been in a cave of music for months and months and months.","There's always something going on, but thank goodness these days it's with a clear head, which helps me massively.","I tried to take heavy metal... and balled it up and chopped it in half and really tried to create a new form of energy. I really tried to re-shape extreme music as I see it through my eyes.","There has got to be a lot of unreleased video out there, live footage and whatnot. There's always going to be something extra for the Pantera fan.","I am the type that cannot stay put in living in the past and solely in the past. It's not healthy and it doesn't feel right.","To do an extreme metal record is something that is well within my capacity as a musician to write stuff out of the box, write stuff that's probably more extreme than the band I'm in at the present time, and it's something that needs to come out of me one way or another.","I'm a bad pessimist. I don't think about how successful any record I've ever done is going to do before it came out.","I think music is a big, big wide world, and I am voyager on this particular ship in this sea of wild music, and I'm gonna dive in and find as many fish as I can and catch them all. I love music.","The success that Pantera had, I could have never, ever forecasted or predicted, and I always felt a responsibility to try to pay even a bit of it forward.","I don't care at all about the mainstream; I don't care about popularity contests; I don't care about who's got the biggest-selling album; and I don't care about glossy production.","With Pantera, we lived through so many trend-of-the-day situations - when grunge was huge, we were still a heavy metal band; when hip-hop started getting incorporated into metal, we stuck to our guns and remained a heavy metal band very purposefully.","I think anyone who suffers from chronic pain can agree with this - you feel this great significance. What I wanted to capture was that significance, and as a matter of fact I think that's one of the lyrics on 'Conflict,' on the split. I touch on the significance, and really it's a selfish thing, in an offbeat way.","In my better sense of mind, I know that I'm far from alone and far from the worst, and the earth keeps spinning. Everything keeps moving, with or without me.","I love music. I love every kind of extreme sort of music, and many different genres, and if I were to have to dedicate myself to just one kind of genre, I would feel kind of gypped. I'd be like, man, I wish I could do this or that. And really all it takes is trying it out.","People are going to think and take things how they're going to take it, and I have no control over that, so it's kind of like biding time until you get your feedback. So, it's like, once the public can consume what you're putting out there, then you know. Then you know hit, miss, in between.","I love to play guitar. I've been writing my own songs on the axe since I was nine years old. I suck at leads.","The lead guitar work is a bit repetitious, but when a song is under two minutes long, I don't have much room anyway. Thank goodness. But I've always contributed guitar parts to every band I've ever been in, so I'll always play the axe.","Singing and playing have always gone hand-in-hand with me. I love 'em both equally.","Knowing what you're up against is part of the strength of writing something that is even, I guess, considered halfway original, knowing what's out there to begin with.","I wake up, and I'll just start reading and trying to brace myself for the rest of the day, and all the while I'm doing that, I'm kicking myself mentally.","You have certain expressions when you write music, a lot of different emotions, a lot of different feelings.","I love the Beatles, and when I was very young, I had young parents, so Led Zeppelin and Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix and the Beatles constantly were big influences on my life.","I've always said that Pantera fans were the best in the world, and I truly meant that, and I still mean it.","I've heard too many times where people say that I'm this ultra-serious guy. In truth, I've got an extremely absurd sense of humor. I thrive on the absurd - I love it.","I think Pantera is a type of band that has been documented very, very well over the years. With the past re-releases, we were fortunate enough to have old demos and stuff that never really saw the light of day. But Pantera was not the type of band to waste many riffs or many parts or songs.","Creating any type of art is all about mood. I've been making extreme music in one fashion or another for decades. And truthfully, Down has a big enough fan base to where I could remain content to do only that, but music is a vast territory and I am an explorer. And I'm a lover of all things considered extreme in music.","I have created hours upon hours of different music over the years that the general public has never heard. Maybe one day I'll release them all in one big package, but we'll see.","I loathe rock stars. I am a music nerd, a fan, a follower... just like any fan of music might be. And although I have blood-relatives, a lot of times I feel closer to my audience than my true family, because at least my fans get what I'm doing, to a certain extent, whereas my family does not.","Communication between band-mates is imperative. Communication is the key to any healthy relationship. If I need to be checked, I expect to hear it put in plain words what my faults are, and give my band-mates the ultimate consideration by shutting up and listening, then acting on the advice given. Same goes for anyone else in any band.","It was awesome growing up in New Orleans because there were great metal bands, there were great hardcore bands, there were great thrash metal bands in the middle '80s and what-not. But then, take me out of New Orleans, and I moved to Fort Worth in 1987, and there's a scene there, too. And Texas absolutely has a different sound.","Honestly, I got the best of both worlds: groove of New Orleans meets the intensity of Texas. That's the best education I could have, the best experiences I could have.","I had the question asked of me before, 'What do you like better: singing or playing guitar?' If I'm gonna be totally truthful, if that microphone's in my hand, I'm loving it. When the guitar's in my hand, I'm a little nervous, but I'm still loving it.","Everyone's gonna have their opinion, everyone's gonna have their favorite bands. The best way I can describe it is music is like food, either you love it, hate it, or are indifferent about it. Or you grow up and acquire a taste for it.","Tastes are varied, man, so much in this music world. Look, I adore the bands that I adore. On the flipside, as much as you love a 100 different genres of bands, there are another 100 I can easily say I dislike, too."],"Phil Bredesen":["The future of our nation depends on our ability to produce food and fiber to sustain the world.","The consequences of decisions don't just affect spreadsheets... They affect, in fundamental ways, the lives of people and they often mean the difference between life and death.","Let's leave behind the predictable and stale debate between liberals and conservatives. Let's take the resources that we have, and prioritize, and manage, and focus our energy on just doing things that count - on real results.","Washington, D.C. is full of think tanks, theoreticians and advocacy groups. Governors are the ones whose feet are on the ground.","If the Southeast represents the new battlefield in the war on meth, then Tennessee clearly is at ground zero.","Our state's strategy on methamphetamine, and any other issue, is going to be a moving target.","The genius of America is that we are still a land of undiscovered shores, and we are at our best when we open our hearts and allow the night winds to bring renewed visions of great deeds.","When John Kerry and Zell Miller and George Bush can agree on an issue, you know it's got legs.","Continuing economic growth requires both recruitment of new companies and expansion of existing businesses.","I like to encourage people who are entrepreneurs-in-waiting.","It's not health care reform to dump more money into Medicaid.","Traditionally, the way deficits have been cut is you hold expenditures more or less constant in real dollars and then let growth come in to fill it up.","We don't go to war on narrow, partisan votes.","Good access to a doctor and a drugstore when you first have a problem can avoid a lot of cost and heartache later.","We have in Tennessee a number of wonderful faith-based clinics to serve the uninsured. It is an important principle with them that everyone pays something as they are able.","Since the 1960s, there has been a tremendous expansion of the resources available to pay for health care."],"Phil Collen":["Every night is a joy; you get an hour and a half of all these hits. It's a lot of fun.","That was the most exciting period, I think: at first, when you get the success on that really large scale.","The big thing that everyone forgets, you're famous and on TV and everything, but I think there's something very rewarding to be able to write a song, record it, and have it turn out as you heard it in your head, or even better.","We'd played for years to half-empty clubs in England."],"Phil Collins":["I'm not a singer who plays a bit of drums. I'm a drummer that sings a bit.","I can't play anywhere near like I used to, and I was a hot drummer. It doesn't bother me, because frankly, if you get to that point where you can't hold a drumstick properly, there are many other things in life which are far more important, like cutting a loaf of bread or a piece of cheese.","If Miles Davis hadn't died it would have been interesting to do an album with him, but there wasn't much else that would have got me into the studio... although Herbie Hancock has just been in touch about doing something and that would be an interesting combination.","I'm usually going to make a record, finish a record, start a record or start a tour or between tours.","I don't own an ABBA album, and I never had the urge to go and buy one. If you're just talking about well crafted pop songs, they were fantastic.","You know, I've released some great records and I've released some dogs. But frankly, the fun is in creating the thing.","The world is in your hands, now use it.","I'm not trying necessarily to become a movie star; that wouldn't be bad but that's not the aim. I'm just trying to do interesting things and go into areas where I've not been before.","There's no magic for getting into the groove... just banging away at it. Sometimes the lyrics come first, sometimes the music.","You know, a song is like a kid. You bring it up. And sometimes something you thought was going to be fantastic, by the time it's finished, is a bit of a disappointment.","That's going to be on my headstone: 'He came. He wrote 'In the Air Tonight.' He... died.'","The story of the Alamo has touched many more people than one would think. So, I would like to pay my respects to those men on both sides of the walls in those months of February and March 1836.","There were 'big stars' at the Alamo! Bowie, Crockett! It is a huge political event because it, and the events at Goliad and San Jacinto, changed the look of a map of America. America would be a very different place if Texas had remained Mexican.","Beyond a certain point, the music isn't mine anymore. It's yours.","The day Tarzan opened in London, I sat in a hotel room and discussed the project in detail.","I don't really belong to that world and I don't think anyone's going to miss me. I'm much happier just to write myself out of the script entirely.","I'm sorry that it was all so successful. I honestly didn't mean it to happen like that. It's hardly surprising that people grew to hate me.","That's the trouble with wishing you were somebody else. As much as you may want it, you know it'll never happen, at least not in this lifetime.","Originally, I thought the story of the Alamo was all these men defending their liberty when they could have left, knowing they were going to die. That's without a doubt what appealed to me, the romance and the nobility. But, as in life, the more you dig the more you find out that things weren't quite like that.","I'm just trying to do things that are interesting for me.","When I go on Japanese Airlines, I really love it because I like Japanese food.","I'll have the music, and then I'll just turn the microphone on, press Play and Record and sing. And whatever comes out ends up being the melody.","And I would like to marry and have more children. I would like to try and do it right.","I've spent the last year and a half going through a very public separation, hiding in hotel lobbies.","To be honest, producing records interests me less at the moment and I really don't want to get involved in album projects that are going to take up a lot of time.","It's always been easy with Mark, he's a rock fan and we speak the same language. He's a big Beatles fan too. We worked a lot via CLI calls, though only meeting up once every couple of months.","I'm writing new songs for a Broadway version of Tarzan, which is very interesting. I think what I learned from the Brother Bear score side of things, I've brought into the new Tarzan songs. Thinking outside just guitar, bass, drums and keyboards.","I can't remember much about the early flights, except that it was ages before we got into First Class.","We stayed in some pretty shabby places in Europe.","When we're touring America or Europe, we use our own plane and a great advantage of that is it cuts out an awful lot of time checking in. You literally drive up to the plane, get on and then drive off at the other end.","I know it shouldn't make a difference, but crossing the dateline, we weren't sure what day it was - it was very strange. Now, I seem to cope with it better.","Another time, we had three days off in Australia, so we went out of our way to fly to Ayres Rock.","I usually hang around the room listening to a bit of last night's show. If there's one available, I go to the steam room every day for my voice. I spend half an hour there and then I eat, because I can't eat later than four o'clock. Then I go for a soundcheck. That's my day.","No seriously... when there's families, you tend to go back to your room after the gig rather than go for a drink with the other guys. But there's always someone who's got something going, like the tour manager.","Often there's a BA crew, because half the time we stay at the same hotels, especially in Australia. I can remember spending quite a lot of time with crews around the pool there. They always make themselves known to us.","I do that in whatever language of the country I'm in, because the audience appreciate it.","On the day of the show, I sit down with someone that speaks very good English and someone who speaks the local language very well and work out what I'm going to say.","Each thing leapfrogs. I do a Genesis project - like now, we're just finishing off an album - and then by the time the album is doing its thing, I could do nothing or I could do a film.","Many of the articles printed over the last few months have ended up painting a picture of me that is more than a little distorted.","In Genesis we saw ourselves as song-writers. After Peter Gabriel left I was the first to say: 'It's OK - we can just do instrumentals.'","In 1977 we played America and Europe three times, and Japan - my marriage suffered as a result. My then wife took the kids to Canada to be near her parents.","'Urban Renewal' was sweet because I've been - unfairly, I would say - plonked in the middle of the road because of a handful of songs. It came at a good time for me, because you do take a bit of a browbeating and, as you get older, you become better at accepting it and realizing why it happens.","I am stopping so I can be a full-time father to my two young sons on a daily basis.","I just don't think of myself as a star. This is what I do for a living; I'm fortunate that I make ends meet.","Many people think of me as a perfectionist, someone who polishes and shines each song and performance. I've always been bothered by that assumption.","It's actually come as quite a shock to learn just how many people don't like me.","I never stopped thinking about the Alamo from that day to this. I'm a huge collector of memorabilia. I've got Davy Crockett's bullet pouch. I've got Colonel Travis's belt.","My only saving grace is that I actually collect things that nobody else is interested in.","And, you know, I never wanted to be a singer.","Yes, I am aware that I have become a caricature. I've thought about this. Conceptually, what I'd like to do is the equivalent of writing myself out of the script.","I started drumming around the same time I came across this part of American history. But there seemed to be a way forward playing drums. There didn't seem to be a way forward being fascinated by a piece of history.","I've bought pretty much every book ever written about the Alamo, and I talk to my friends that I've made over the past 15, 20 years. It's just a constant learning and fascinating thing for me.","I've got one of four known Davy Crocket rifles. It's fantastic just to know it's one of the rifles that he actually used. His cousin had it.","I joined Genesis when I was 19. I've earned the right to actually do nothing. I don't want to be a shadow of what I was, so I've kind of just quite willingly stood back.","As soon as you start making a record, things start getting lined up: the promotion, possibly even a tour.","It's not often that an English drummer gets an Oscar. So I'm very, very proud of that.","To see a lot of the smaller labels disappear or get gobbled up by the bigger labels, that's a shame. It was a bit of a shock at first to see the demise of the record stores.","I grew up in the day when the Beatles sold 1 million singles in a week. And all you've got to do now is sell about 10,000 singles and you're in the charts.","I don't really listen to music.","I prefer black music in general.","The difference between the American version of 'Live Aid' and the British one - in England, if you wanted a cup of tea, you made it yourself. If you wanted a sandwich, you bought it. In typical American style, at the American concert, there were laminated tour passes and champagne and caviar.","I have never been a Conservative, or at least not since being a young teenager. My father voted Conservative, and even his doing that was a hangover from the '50s and '60s, which may have been an influence on me.","I'm fascinated by what people will do to each other. Actually, I'm sort of interested in the gory details of life.","Everything has added up to a load that I'm getting tired of carrying. It's gotten so complicated. It's the three failed marriages, and having kids that grew up without me, and it's the personal criticism, of being Mr. Nice Guy, or of divorcing my wife by fax, all that stuff, the journalism, some of which I find insulting.","All I set out to do was to earn a living playing drums, you know? And as luck would have it, I've surpassed that.","When I was five or six, I started dressing up like Davy Crockett.","I never said I was at the Alamo. Someone else said I was at the Alamo. Now I'm a nutter. I don't think that's fair.","If a musician dares to get out of the box he's been put in, people get confused. They want people where they can find them! I am fortunate in some respects as I've always been known as someone who 'moves around' and tries different things. But generally, we are supposed to stay where we're put.","Genesis fans are a religious group!"],"Phil Condit":["We are moving toward a global economy. One way of approaching that is to pull the covers over your head. Another is to say: It may be more complicated - but that's the world I am going to live in, I might as well be good at it.","Each of us has come to share the same point of view, that a global e-marketplace is absolutely essential if we are to drive new levels of efficiency for the industry.","In simple terms, we are aligning our business today with the way we believe future systems are going to be designed, acquired and maintained.","None of us is as smart as all of us.","Our entire team is focused on managing this company for value - fixing or eliminating those operations that lessen value and expanding or adding those that enhance value.","Two quarters doesn't make a trend, but it's a heck of a lot better than none."],"Phil Crane":["Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan had tremendous influence on generations of American because, even if people disagreed with them, they admired them because they made very strong commitments to things they believed in.","I certainly respect privacy and privacy rights. But on the other hand, the first function of government is to guarantee the security of all the people.","As my dad said, you have an obligation to leave the world better than how you found it. And he also reminded us to be givers in this life, and not takers.","I never let politics get personal. You can have the most intense, heated debate on issues, and so long as you keep it on issues, you can go out and have coffee afterwards and you're good friends."],"Phil Crosby":["If anything is certain, it is that change is certain. The world we are planning for today will not exist in this form tomorrow.","Making a wrong decision is understandable. Refusing to search continually for learning is not.","Quality has to be caused, not controlled.","Selecting the right person for the right job is the largest part of coaching.","Quality is the result of a carefully constructed cultural environment. It has to be the fabric of the organization, not part of the fabric.","Eliminating what is not wanted or needed is profitable in itself.","Being convinced one knows the whole story is the surest way to fail.","Successful people breed success.","In a true zero-defects approach, there are no unimportant items.","Very few of the great leaders ever get through their careers without failing, sometimes dramatically.","You have to lead people gently toward what they already know is right.","You don't have to be noisy to be effective.","The audience only pays attention as long as you know where you are going.","We can spend our whole lives underachieving.","No one can remember more than three points.","A rule to live by: I won't use anything I can't explain in five minutes.","Slowness to change usually means fear of the new.","The great discoveries are usually obvious.","Change should be a friend. It should happen by plan, not by accident."],"Phil Daniels":["It's great to do small plays in the theatre and then go off with Blur and play in front of thousands of people.","When I was a kid doing television, they'd stick a leather jacket on me, and I would be the thug.","Acting is my passion, and Chelsea FC is my hobby.","'Vinyl' is a good look at the music industry. The script was honest.","I grew up near King's Cross station in London, living in an apartment block where my dad was a caretaker.","My acting career began when I walked into a drama school class run by Anna Scher in Islington. Anna discovered a lot of people: Linda Robson, Pauline Quirke, Gary and Martin Kemp, and Dexter Fletcher were among my contemporaries.","It's never gone so far as me wishing I'd never done 'Quadrophenia,' but there was a time when I wouldn't talk about it because I wanted people to be interested in me for other things as well.","My philosophy is to enjoy yourself. Do the things you want to do, like play golf!","Being a part-time pop star was perfect, really, when I wasn't worn out by the partying.","I used to go into bars on my days off, and I decided that wasn't too good for me.","It was a wonderful experience to live the life for a year; to spend all day doing Shakespeare and then do a play in the evening.","I get on with actors, and when I'm doing a theatre show, it's great being with them all the time. But we're all alike, and it's much nicer being with people who are different.","I think that's what keeps you grounded - having your own life that's not directed by your job.","Acting is a tough industry. There are a lot of kids out there at drama schools and not a lot of money about, especially as the arts are being cut.","I don't miss 'EastEnders.' I did a two-stretch. That was enough.","I found that golf saved me from going to the pub every day, so instead, I play golf with other unemployed actors. I'm a member of the Stage Golfing Society, and I play golf with all sorts of people.","I had a weimaraner for 11 years called China, and he was a great dog, a bit mad. They're massive, weimaraners; they've got big floppy ears. They look like a pointer, but they're liver-coloured.","In my game, you get brokenhearted a bit. You do a play, get a bad review in the papers... actors are sensitive; you think of all the work you've done, and it breaks your heart, but you learn to shrug it off and to carry on.","I'm famous for being a silky midfielder.","Doing 'EastEnders' wasn't exactly suffering, but my soul's not in quick-fix TV. Theatre doesn't pay like TV work pays, though. We all have to live, don't we?","My heart's in stage. Making 'Quadrophenia' was exciting because we were riding around on scooters with no crash helmets. But 'hurry up and wait' is the anthem of films. Everybody wants you ready, and then you sit doing nothing.","I like people like Robert De Niro and Anthony Hopkins. And Gianfranco Zola, who played for Chelsea and Italy. He's an artist with his feet.","When my daughter was born, I called her Ella Bella Mandela, because she was born the day after Mandela was released from prison."],"Phil Donahue":["Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.","Spanking and verbal criticism have become, to many parents, more important tools of child rearing than approval.","In a network situation, a vice president, while he's shaving, can decide your history.","Recognition should come to the reporter who uncovers public cheating or proves a convicted man innocent.","Presenting statues of honor to reporters for covering an earthquake is like presenting a first prize to a doctor for performing surgery.","Some people are uncomfortable with the idea that humans belong to the same class of animals as cats and cows and raccoons. They're like the people who become successful and then don't want to be reminded of the old neighborhood.","To a journalist, good news is often not news at all.","In reality, the most important things happen when you don't look for them.","In 1953 there were two ways for an Irish Catholic boy to impress his parents: become a priest or attend Notre Dame.","Miss Child is never bashful with butter.","I think the idea of creating a television news source that is not beholden to corporate interests is nirvana.","Marlo taught me things I thought I knew.","At first, I thoroughly enjoyed being famous.","I tip like crazy. They'll remember me. Celebrity can be expensive.","Airlines are interesting. They not only favor celebrities, they court them.","I have moved from certainty to doubt, from devotion to rebellion.","I was proud of the waves I had made, but wondered how many boats I was supposed to rock.","Praising the Lord and passing the ammunition are mutually exclusive ideas.","December 25th has become guilt and obligation.","A large psychic void is left by a loss of faith. So many Catholics have tried so many things to replace it.","The Tube is a vehicle for selling things, not for exploring ideas.","I have had time to analyze my feelings. I am certain that they are totally neurotic, sexist, silly, and a big waste of time.","We should not use crippled children to sell hamburgers. Ever.","The system of volunteerism is divisive. It pits one charity against the others for the charity dollar.","Television is not the exclusive target of promoters. Is Superman really worthy of a Newsweek cover?","When I was a kid, people who got divorced were people who had no gumption.","When we had been married five years, we had six children. What, in God's name, was wrong with me?","Is it any wonder that for millions of men the only intimacy is physical, silent, and predictable?","I believe celebrity spoils people - some worse than others.","I find celebrity status difficult to bear when I am in the company of my mother.","They were terrified that we were going to become an anti-war kind of platform.","Everybody is under pressure to shut up and sing.","I could never understand how we could put 120,000 Japanese behind a fence in World War II. I remember being bewildered about that.","Oprah is more than an institution. Oprah is a very special star in the firmament. I can't imagine a greater success than she's enjoyed.","Saddam was a bastard, but he was our bastard."],"Phil Everly":["If you lose your concentration singing harmony, then it's lackluster and no fun to watch.","It's hard to get fluffed up about love anymore. I've lived it. I try to avoid it. If I'm extremely fond of a woman, if I think I might really wind up walking down the aisle again... I go in another direction.","Don and I are infamous for our split, but we're closer than most brothers. Harmony singing requires that you enlarge yourself, not use any kind of suppression. Harmony is the ultimate love.","The '60s weren't my cup of tea. I never bought that philosophy that, you know, we're all brothers and that'll solve everything. And I never believed that music dictated the times. I always thought it reflected them.","When we first started recording, it was before rock, so people thought we were hillbilly hicks. That was something we had to deal with; the girls didn't think we were cool, although they did a few years later. We had ducktails and wore peg-leg pants. We looked like rock n' rollers.","Singing harmony is not the same as singing a part in a choral group, where you know you're going to have to hit this note and then that note. There are nuances that change every day. Maybe today you have a slight cold or voice fatigue, or you've done something and there's a slight difference in your breathing.","You couldn't get me to go travel around and sit in a hotel room again. I have no interest in doing that. So everybody's happy. I am, at 74. Some people like doing it, but I never was much for that, anyway. It's a lot of work. So the only thing I miss about all of it is the camaraderie of the tour, but that doesn't offset the rest of it.","Whenever people talk about Don and I recording again, which almost everybody usually mentions, I always say 'Well, there's plenty of things that you haven't heard! Plenty of things out there to discover!'","In the beginning of rock n' roll, there was always innovation. Artists were always trying to do something new and something different.","In my old age, it's kind of funny - at night, what I like to do is watch TV when I go to sleep. And what I really like is to put on a Gene Autry film, because he sings really well. So he sings me to sleep.","My son and I run a string company, and he has a studio there, and I go down sometimes and we'll record.","I grew up as a Roy Rogers fan, of course."],"Phil Foglio":["One of the characteristics I cherish in my friends is their childlike gullibility, and several excited minutes were spent trying to actually find this book.","I didn't really think about becoming a professional artist until high school, when I realized that everything else required too much math.","If we had to go live action, I'd hold out for Tim Burton to direct.","As it happened, I had a friend who was a good person who liked to present himself as a dreadful one. Using him as a role model, I created the first Buck Godot strip.","Why the hell can't people just write nice happy stories about people having happy sex? That's what I want, and I bet a whole bunch of other people want it too.","I've also been busy doing stuff for Steve Jackson Games.","My only requirement for that first story was that there had to be a fight or an explosion on every page. Naturally, no one wanted to publish it, but I liked the character, did a few stories to keep my hand in.","We start out talking about the story, trying to figure out who is who and what should happen, taking notes the whole time. Then I do a rough layout of the issue, showing what happens on each page. Then we discuss that some more."],"Phil Gingrey":["The SSA's practice of allowing union activity during normal federal government operations is unfair to seniors and taxpayers.","At the end of the day, every member of the conservative movement, from our political commentators and thinkers to our elected officials, share an important and common purpose in advancing the cause of liberty, reigning in a bloated federal government, and defending our traditional family values.","As an OB-GYN physician, I understand the importance of protecting Americans from sexually transmitted diseases, and I applaud the development of an HPV vaccine. But for states to mandate vaccination for young women is both unprecedented and unacceptable.","There are some problems, and maybe these huge magazines, even, for someone who says, 'Look, I just use an AR-15 for target practice,' but do you really need to be standing there shooting at a silhouette a shot a second or even quicker with that kind of weapon? For what purpose?","Once we as doctors are entrusted with the well-being of our patients and their children, it is our duty to take action, to be selfless, and fulfill our obligation to the service of others. I did so willingly, and it brought me great joy throughout my professional career. However, I always had a desire to do more.","The takeover of the U.S. House by Republicans could prompt a revival of the fight for additional funding for the Marietta-built F-22 stealth fighter. This isn't just for the sake of home-cooking, but also for the sake of the country.","Deep ocean drilling is not new.","I used to go to Savannah all the time as a teenager, and we've got some friends down in Valdosta, so I feel like I've got a good base of support.","A rising tide lifts all boats, and you have to start with job creation. We will never get there until we replace all these jobs that have been lost.","I get along with people. But I don't sacrifice my principles either.","Spending on largely ineffective programs - although well intentioned - is a detriment to fostering real job growth.","As a physician for over 30 years, I am well aware of the dangers infectious diseases pose.","Reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as swine flu, dengue fever, Ebola virus and tuberculosis are particularly concerning.","We will literally send a van and a photographer to the home of anybody that can say they can't get a picture made and a photo ID and we will do it... at the state's cost and the taxpayer cost and not at the individual cost.","I don't have hard edges.","Our servicemen and women are highly trained, highly skilled, and the most professional fighting force in the world.","I will continue fighting to protect our Second Amendment rights.","In 2012, a hamburger cost Amtrak $16.15, with riders paying $9.50. This means that we, the taxpayers, are forced to pick up the tab for the remaining $6.65 through subsidies provided to Amtrak.","As long as I am in the Congress, I will continue to fight for and defend our sacred values.","I have actively opposed every bailout, every rebate check, every so called 'stimulus.'","I am not a career politician, even though this is my 12th year in the United States House of Representatives.","I am a career physician. I practiced for 32 years before I began my career as a public servant.","I have been blessed, working both at the local level on a community school board, the state assembly, four years in the state senate, and now almost 12 years in the House of Representatives.","A lot of people get elected to Congress, and sometimes a part of their pledge is a term-limit pledge. There's no accountability.","Official time is not fair to the government or the taxpayer and works solely to the benefit of labor unions and employees who serve as its representative or steward.","With an extraordinary amount of federal employees authorized to use 100% official time on behalf of their union, the federal government loses the immensely valuable civil service for which he or she was originally hired to perform.","I think Tom Frieden, the CDC director, is a good man, is a good doctor and, I think, basically has done a good job.","A majority of Americans think Obamacare will make health care in our country worse, and they're right.","States should require vaccinations for communicable diseases, like measles and the mumps. But you can't catch HPV if an infected schoolmate coughs on you or shares your juice box at lunch. Whether or not girls get vaccinated against HPV is a decision for parents and physicians, not state governments.","The reality of this Obamacare provision is that young adults will be forced to subsidize healthcare costs for older, financially stable, working-age Americans. At a time when 20-somethings face underemployment, record school debt and less economic opportunity, it is unfair to saddle them with this burden.","I was proud to represent the 11th District of Georgia as a member of Congress for the past 12 years and am excited to now be joining the respected, growing Government & Regulatory Affairs Practice at Drinker Biddle & Reath.","I pledge to give all there is of myself.","I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.","I'll help repeal Obamacare in my first term, or go home, because you deserve a senator who gets the job done or gets out of the way. Repeal or go home. That's my pledge to you.","What it is basically, if you go to a gun show, and there's somebody out there in the parking lot, and they're getting out of their car, and they've got an A-15 on their shoulder, or... John Q. Public wants to sell a handgun or whatever, then there's no background check.","With each new appropriations bill Congress considers, I have to ask myself, 'Is this a good way to spend taxpayer dollars?'","As a practicing physician for over 30 years, I can assure the president that the majority of physicians in this country are for health-care reform - just not the government-run reform he prefers.","We have responsibility for ONC and the HITECH act. We've spent tens of billions on non-interoperable products. It may be time for us to look closer at the activities of vendors in the space, given the possibility that fraud is being perpetrated on the American people.","It's easy if you're Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh or even sometimes Newt Gingrich to stand back and throw bricks.","I think the time has come when the American people understand that federal employees need to work an 8-hour day just like everybody else.","For goodness' sakes, back in 2006, when we were about to lose the battle in Iraq, thank goodness our patriots fought in the Anbar province and Fallujah and turned that thing around.","Republicans are listening and offering better solutions that get Washington out of your way, out of your pocket, and back on your side.","Americans are calling for a return to common sense in how we solve problems and how the people communicate with their government.","Americans are proud of this country. They want to see things get better, and they want to be part of that turnaround. That's what America Speaking Out is all about.","Most of the folks to whom I listen are concerned for their future. Too many of them know someone who's out of work, has lost their own job, or fear they might. And, they increasingly believe that the opportunity for a better life for their children is slipping away.","Americans are fed up with how things are going in the country right now. They see more job losses, rising debt and plummeting home sales. They feel let down by a government that passes one 2,000-page, trillion-dollar law after another instead of focusing on addressing the problems Americans worry about every day.","Roger Kahn is someone with a gazillion dollars who thinks that he can use his vast fortune to buy television spots, particularly network television, and boost up his positives, make him appear to be a gentleman farmer, and cover up his warts.","It's very easy for the candidates to talk about how conservative they are, how conservative they will be.","I call this 'boss Obamacare.' The only health care that citizens of this country can access are those approved by the boss.","I am angry - mad - at the Chief Justice, John Roberts.","I've been watching and involved in presidential politics since 1960 when I first voted, and the Republican, the conservative candidate in the primary is always going to lean right and come back to the center for the general - the opposite for the Democrat.","There are a lot of undecideds in this country that are hopefully right of center, not left of center.","Nobody is more conservative in the Congress and the House than Phil Gingrey.","Yes, we can pay the interest on the debt. We can renew the $500 billion worth of bonds that are coming due. We can mail out our Social Security checks. We can make sure those Medicare claims are honored. We can pay our military. We can protect our veterans. But when you get beyond that, the soup gets a little thin.","I'm not itching for a fight. But I'm just saying when I see the other guy putting on his boxing gloves and, you know, you've got dancing around in the ring, I kind of suspect that maybe a fight's coming.","Speaker Boehner is doing a great job.","Leader Reid is doing a horrendous job.","Everyone depending on foreign fuels are all too inclined, it seems, to let jobs leave this country.","We can't take our ball and go home when the consequences mean a weaker America.","We tell infertile couples all the time that are having trouble conceiving because of the woman not ovulating, 'Just relax. Drink a glass of wine. And don't be so tense and uptight because all that adrenaline can cause you not to ovulate.'","The influx of families and unaccompanied children at the border poses many risks, including grave public health threats.","The border patrol gave us a list of the diseases that they're concerned about, and Ebola was one of those.","Democrats like to picture us as pushing grandmother over the cliff or throwing someone under the bus. In either one of those scenarios, at least the senior has a chance to survive.","President Obama has already ended Medicare as we know it.","Of my three daughters and one daughter-in-law, they all work. They all work, some of them full-time, some of them part-time. But they're still there as moms. And when they come home and take over that responsibility, they need a shared partner, and that partner is that partner for life. And I'm talking about, of course, the father.","I believe I was sent to Washington to fight for and defend our traditional values of smaller government, lower taxes, a strong national defense, and the lives of the unborn.","I think that our leadership, Mitch McConnell and John Boehner, are taking the right approach.","Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Newt Gingrich, and other conservative giants are the voices of the conservative movement's conscience. Every day, millions and millions of Americans - myself included - turn on their radios and televisions to listen to what they have to say, and we are inspired by their words and by their determination.","To suggest that we can't pay our debts - that's absolutely not true.","I will be personally seeking alternatives for my family's health care coverage, just like the rest of Americans affected by Obamacare. In the meantime, I will do everything in my power to fight this terrible piece of legislation.","I don't want to continue to fund Obamacare.","A lot of times, you're just so determined to get everything that you're going to vote 'no' if you don't. But if you get 75% of what you want and what your district wants, you should be satisfied with that.","People need to look beyond just the immediate victory... There are no permanent victories.","We're concerned with a powerful government who is telling General Motors now, maybe, what they can charge for their automobiles. Indeed, if the government owns 61 percent, they can do that.","Reports have indicated that several border agents have contracted diseases through contact with the unaccompanied minors.","In 26 years of delivering babies, I've always been interested in government and the state of the union.","I have always been someone who wants to get it right. That started when I ran for school board. It's an avocation that's become a full-time job.","To create employment, we need to stimulate the economy, and to stimulate the economy, we need to cut spending and reduce the deficit.","We sincerely believed that we don't tax too little in Washington. We spend too much.","We could repeal Dodd-Frank. I think that would be a big help.","I truly believe that the job creators, those people making $200,000 a year, are the small business men and women that create the jobs and ultimately will help the middle class and the poor.","The vaunted Democratic stimulus bill has failed to stimulate anything other than a few federal bureaucrats.","People do not want that public option.","I truly believe that we have the best health care system in the world. It's not perfect, but this business of turning it over to the federal government to try to make it perfect is quite honestly asinine.","For the life of me, I can't understand why BP couldn't go in at the ocean floor, maybe 10 feet lateral to the - around the periphery, drill a few holes, and put a little ammonium nitrate, some dynamite, in those holes and detonate that dynamite and seal that - seal that leak. And seal it permanently.","People - particularly in the Southeast, Georgia, my district, all across the state - they don't want the federal government to have the ability, at times whenever the federal government wants to declare an emergency, to start going around and confiscating people's guns."],"Phil Gramm":["The American story is a story of immigration. I would be the last person who would say immigrants are not important to America.","Government is not the generator of economic growth; working people are.","We have benefited greatly from the globalization of the economy in the last 30 years.","I'd rather go to the dentist... but I'm going.","Half the world does not know the joys of wearing cotton underwear.","The cap-and-trade plan is more market driven than anything else. If you want to discourage carbon use, you have to make it more expensive, but what is crucial is that this be a worldwide program that includes China and India.","I have the most reliable friend you can have in American politics, and that is ready money.","I'm carrying so much pork, I'm beginning to get trichinosis.","The genius of the American system is that through freedom we have created extraordinary results from plain old ordinary people.","It's not fair to say that people who work with their head or with their hands ought to pay taxes, but people who earn their living with capital ought not to.","Quite frankly, I think nothing could do more to immediately bolster national security then enabling us to produce more oil and gas here at home at a price consumers could afford.","The Democrats want government to do the spending. Senator McCain wants families to do the spending.","There are a lot of things you can say about the Bush tax cuts, but you can't say they didn't work.","I believe I am more conservative than Bob Dole; I believe I am more committed to fundamentally changing American government than Bob Dole.","It is clear to me that Democrats want to attack me rather than debate Sen. McCain on important economic issues facing the country. That kind of distraction hurts not only Sen. McCain's ability to present concrete programs to deal with the country's problems; it hurts the country.","I have to tell you that the innovation and the technology and the entrepreneurship of the world still lies in the United States of America.","Every technological advance we've made in the 21st century and throughout the 20th has come from the United States of America.","I said we are in a mental recession. We keep getting the steady drumbeat of bad news... it's become a mental recession. We don't have measured negative growth. That's a fact, that's not a commentary.","Misery sells newspapers."],"Phil Harris":["The skit was very successful based on the applause. After that show, the three of us decided to get together and try and come up with some songs that we could all participate in.","In those days, it didn't take much imagination to come up with something that required great lyric development skills. You just thought of an experience that you might have gone through, and write it down.","He asked my girlfriend if we could come over and sing some of the songs that we had written, which we did. After he heard the songs, he said that he knew someone in the record business by the name of Bob Shad.","The way they had the room that I was in set up, there was some sort of sound deadening platform that I had to stand on in order to get close enough to the microphone.","Each one of us had a little story to tell and each recording was based on that. Lou played all of the music but we both sort of kicked around some cords during the writing phase.","We were not given any statistics as to how many records were pressed on the blue label. I used to ask Bob Shad how we were going to get paid from record sales and what I got for an answer was not to worry about the business end of the deal.","I remember seeing the song in some diners on the selection gadget that plays records at the table while you were eating. We were never told if the songs ever got on any charts.","If the record was picked up by Dot Records, I would imagine that they would have wanted both sides of the record to be something by Lou alone which would account for the dropping of 'So Blue'.","We played in bars and other such establishments and anywhere where people would listen. Sometimes they did, and sometimes not. The outfits we wore were classics of the 50's.","Lou and I met while we were in high school in our senior year. We were in many of the same classes together and quite a few times we went over to his house to hang out."],"Phil Hartman":["I've succeeded beyond my wildest dreams - financially and the amount of fun I have in my life.","I benefit from the Mr. Potato Head syndrome. Put a wig and a nose and glasses on me, and I disappear.","I could do John Wayne, Jack Benny, Jack Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and entertain my friends. But I never seriously considered it as a career choice.","Even at Westchester High in West LA, I was class clown.","One of the remarkable things about my career is that it has been marked by steady, incremental progress. No sudden spikes up, and no sudden downfalls, either.","I was 36, and I had decided to quit acting because it was so disappointing.","I found the writing arena to be much less competitive.","As an actor, I felt I couldn't compete. I wasn't as cute as the leading man; I wasn't as brilliant as Robin Williams.","The one thing I could do was voices and impersonations and weird characters, and there was really no call for that, except on Saturday Night Live.","I think my most famous was 'Poco's Legend.' It's a white album with a simple line drawing of a horse. It almost has a Picasso feel to it. I remember that Rusty Young, the lead singer of the band, said, 'I want you to draw a horse for the song 'Legend,' which is about a phantom spirit horse. I want you to do it in several lines.'","My brothers and sisters and I spoke in a language called Egg Latin. In the early '50s in Canada, this became a fad way of talking among certain people. It's based on the concept that in every syllable before the vowel and after the preceding constant you insert the word 'egg.' So, my name Phil would be 'Pegghil.'","'Blasto' is a new game for Sony Playstation. It's an awesome three-dimensional game, and I play the character Blasto who's sort of a Flash Gordon barrel-chested superhero who goes to Uranus and shoots these little green alien Fascist guys. He rescues babes; he goes on wild rides.","I think there's a notion in our society, and it may be valid, that people aren't as funny when they get older. It's a stigma still attached to the rebelliousness of youth.","It's fun coming in as the second or third lead. If the movie or TV show bombs, you aren't to blame.","I'm a really big fan of Bill Murray."],"Phil Humber":["God is so good.","I had never seen a perfect game or no-hitter thrown.","Everything that happens to you, I feel like it helps you develop as a person, as a player.","The difference between a home run and a swing-and-a-miss is, what, an inch and a half? You can throw a great pitch, the guy makes a great swing. And if it's at a guy, it's an out. That's the beauty of baseball, really. There's not just one guy in control.","When you have an injury in your forearm, it affects the command of your pitches. I would yank pitches down away, or they were staying up. I'd go to accelerate, but everything would come forward except the ball. The ball was staying behind. When you have an inconsistent release point like that, it's impossible to throw a changeup.","I told my wife that since we have a little one on the way, maybe when he gets old enough, instead of just taking a vacation to the beach or Disney World or something like that, we go and do something that actually has an impact on other people. That would be neat for him to experience and for us to do as a family."],"Phil Jackson":["Always keep an open mind and a compassionate heart.","I think the most important thing about coaching is that you have to have a sense of confidence about what you're doing. You have to be a salesman, and you have to get your players, particularly your leaders, to believe in what you're trying to accomplish on the basketball floor.","Love is the force that ignites the spirit and binds teams together.","Basketball is a simple game. Your goal is penetration, get the ball close to the basket, and there are three ways to do that. Pass, dribble and offensive rebound.","I think the most important thing about coaching is that you have to have a sense of confidence about what you're doing.","As much as we pump iron and we run to build our strength up, we need to build our mental strength up... so we can focus... so we can be in concert with one another.","My father was a man who didn't consider himself learned. He was a man who liked to be a farmer. He enjoyed his dairy farm and felt the calling. So there was a dedication. I was dedicated as a child to the service of God, and so there was this continual centering of a greater purpose than your own.","Wisdom is always an overmatch for strength.","Approach the game with no preset agendas and you'll probably come away surprised at your overall efforts.","Your problems never cease. They just change.","You have to be able to psychologically help your players, support-wise, be in touch with them, so I think managing people is very important.","If you meet the Buddha in the lane, feed him the ball.","For us tall people, the whole key is that your hips and your knees should form a right angle when you sit down. That's where backs and hips get to be problems for big guys.","I think the most rewarding part of the job, and I think most coaches would say it, is practice. If you have it, a very good practice in which you have 12 guys participate, and they can really get something out of it, lose themselves in practice.","I replaced three joints in my hips and one in my knee. I'm hoping that other knee doesn't have to be done. It's one of the toughest things to overcome.","My philosophy is that you don't motivate players with speeches; you have motivated players that you draft. That's where they come in, and those are the guys that are competitive. You can not teach competitiveness.","I gave it my body and mind, but I have kept my soul.","Pau is one of the best big men in the game. I mean, Pau Gasol is going to be in the Hall of Fame.","I'm a sports-watcher. I played football and baseball, coached baseball. So I watch those things.","I played hockey in North Dakota growing up and watch a lot of that.","I'm not going to coach again. I've done my coaching, and I think I can put that aside.","My father was the superintendent of the churches in the state of Montana. He was content in his beliefs. He befit the term 'true Christian.' He would turn the other cheek. He was truly a man of peace.","When I was young, I was dedicated to become a minister - my brothers and I were formally brought in front of the congregation in a dedication ceremony, where we were dedicated to the future service of God.","The winter's a little bit daunting in Montana.","I think there's something about wanting to stand in the spotlight. I think the ball is a spotlight, for example, and I think they want to stand in that. I a lot of times see - LeBron is a guy that vacillates between wanting to do that and then wanting to get somebody else involved.","My parents were, had a marriage of passion, and the passion was about their religious beliefs. They were both immigrant families that - well, my father's family came as Puritans to Massachusetts.","My mother's families were Mennonites or Anabaptists that came to Minnesota from Russia. They were actually moving around Europe doing diking and lowland reclamation work, and they moved into Minnesota.","There's a lot of chatter in basketball and, rightfully, you want players to be talking to each other... But sometimes in practice, it gets too verbose... so I tried to take things out of the ordinary and make them special so they'd understand the difference.","The NBA has made a real issue about really making these superstars the premium that everybody wants to go to. That's their calling card and their marketing tool. But the coaches at the other end of the sphere are trying to make everybody on the team, even nine, 10, 11, 12, just as important, and have a real role that's meaningful."],"Phil Keoghan":["Riding a bicycle is about getting back to basics. It's good for the waistline and it's good for the wallet, is what I'm saying.","La Paz, Bolivia, is the most extraordinary city.","I like to have fun with them. I like to toy with them a little bit. we're making television, after all. Right?","I really wish we could stay longer in the countries we visit, but I've been lucky to have visited most of them before, because I've done a tremendous amount of travel.","People ask me what the most important thing to take on the race is, and I always say it's a sense of humor. If you've got nothing but a sense of humor, you will survive.","With any good story, you need the adversary, the heroes and villains. You need a good mixture to make it work.","Inevitably you're going to be delayed somewhere. Always have a book. Always have a movie. Always have a notebook. And then always have a sense of humour.","There's a sameness and comfort level you get living in a country like America."],"Phil Klay":["Resilience is, of course, necessary for a warrior. But a lack of empathy isn't.","I suppose it is the lot of soldiers and Marines to be objectified according to the politics of the day and the mood of the American people about their war.","I went straight from the Marine Corps to the MFA. The way that you would express things among Marines is somewhat different than the way you're supposed to express things in a creative-writing workshop.","Though I continue to tell stories about Iraq, I sometimes fear this makes me a fraud. I feel guilty about the sorrow I feel because I know it is manufactured, and I feel guilty about the sorrow I do not feel because it is owed, it is the barest beginnings of what is owed to the fallen.","Going to war is a rare experience in American culture, so it's easy for simple notions to gain a lot of weight. The reality is always more complex.","I was a public affairs officer. I worked with the media, but I didn't just stay at my desk. I assisted in military duties, travelled around Anbar province, hung out with a wide variety of Marines.","Sometimes macho language is to mask things people are not ready to deal with.","War is an arena for the display of courage and virtue. Or war is politics by other means. War is a quasi-mystical experience where you get in touch with the real. There are millions of narratives we impose to try to make sense of war.","I don't believe in any Greatest Generation. I believe in great events. They sweep ordinary people up, expose them to extremes of human behavior and unimaginable tests of integrity and courage, and then deposit them back on the home front.","The civilian wants to respect what the veteran has gone through. The veteran wants to protect memories that are painful and sacred to him from outside judgment.","I have friends with post-traumatic stress - friends with post-traumatic stress who are, you know, highly successful, capable people.","Pity addresses the perceived suffering, not the whole individual.","We're told that when we remember, the same parts of our brain light up as when we experienced the event we're remembering. Your brain lives through it again.","The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are as much every U.S. citizen's wars as they are the veterans' wars. If we don't assume that civilians have just as much ownership and the moral responsibilities that we have as a nation when we embark on something like that, then we're in a very bad situation.","It's easier to get people to talk to you if you're a vet and you want to interview a vet about war. Sometimes they open up a little bit easier.","People have a very political way of looking at war, and that's understandable.","War is complicated and intense, and it takes time and thoughts to understand what it was.","Writing 'Redeployment' shook me in ways I never expected.","After the fighting is done, and even when it's still happening, apologies are often needed for the recounting of bare facts. Sometimes bare facts feel unpatriotic.","I literally went straight to New York City from Iraq, which was bizarre and complicated. I was walking down Madison Avenue, and it was spring, and people were smartly dressed, and it was so strange because there was no sense that we were at war. It was something to grapple with.","Responsibility and accountability is a big part of being in the military.","I doubt there's anything you could say to Donald Rumsfeld that would puncture the armor of his narcissism.","I've been asked what differentiates war literature as a category, and I don't think there is anything.","In war, it feels like everything you're doing is more important because you're in the proximity of violence and death, and that proximity changes your relationship to America because it changes the way you see the world.","I'd been in college studying English creative writing and history when I made the decision to join the Marines in the runup to the Iraq war.","I saw so many radically different versions of Iraq. It would have been difficult for me to come back and think, 'This is the Iraq experience.'","One thing I've always liked about the military is there's a certain amount of pragmatism.","It's a professional military. You sign up and agree to allow your countrymen to use your life as they see fit for the next four years. And I think we all should have a greater role in ensuring that we use those lives wisely.","I started with things that I was troubled by or confused by or interested in, and then I wrote stories to try to puzzle my way through it. But the question is not how to represent war, because it's an abstract thing that's felt differently for all the characters.","Marines and soldiers don't issue themselves orders; they don't send themselves overseas. United States citizens elect the leaders who send us overseas.","A lot of times, you're interacting with people for whom you're one of the very few veterans that they've met or had a lot of interactions with, and there's a temptation for you to feel like you can pontificate about what the experience was or what it meant, and that leads to a lot of nonsense.","I don't want to act as though my deployment was particularly rough, because it wasn't. I had a very mild deployment; I was a staff officer.","When I first came back from Iraq, I of course found myself thinking a lot about it. Not just my experiences, but those of people I talked to, friends, and colleagues.","A lot of the great pieces of journalism from Iraq showed how important command influence was in violent, aggressive environments, where Marines and soldiers had a constrained set of choices to make in sudden moments.","We have a tendency to think of war as this quasi-mystical thing, and that interpretation flattens the experience - by using different perspectives, I wanted to open a place for readers to compare and contrast, to make judgments, to engage.","There's a wide spectrum between a Navy SEAL hero-killer and a traumatized victim, but those are the archetypes - hashed and rehashed in the media, in popular culture, in the minds of people with a lot of preconceived notions but not much else.","I got to travel around Anbar Province, had a great group of Marines who worked for me who traveled around Anbar Province. I got to hang out with a lot of different types of Marines and soldiers and sailors.","Bombs do very, very bad things to human bodies. It's incredibly shocking to see.","I'm generally not a fan of didactic art because it papers over many of the hard experiences about war or anything else in life. I wanted to explore various aspects of the experience without an eye towards delivering any particular message.","It's not a problem to be surrounded by other writers if that's the craft that you're doing. I suppose if you get obsessed with the notion of being a writer more than the writing itself, that would be bad. But I live near really smart, thoughtful people who take writing very seriously, and I can meet them for breakfast and talk books.","If you write a novel where war is nothing but hell and no one experiences excitement or cracks a dark joke, then you're not actually admitting the full experience.","I always wrote - not about war, necessarily, but I always wrote stories. I tried to write while I was in Iraq. It's not really - I didn't do a very good job, and not about war.","I have two friends named Matt. They're both scouts in the cavalry. They both served in the same section of Iraq. They both worked with the same Iraqi translator. And yet, if you talk to them, their stories couldn't be more different, because one was there in 2006. One was there in 2008.","There's a very particular way that the military speaks. There's a lot of profanity and a lot of acronyms.","A great writer is a great writer... Tolstoy was not a woman, but 'Anna Karenina' is still a pretty good book.","One of the things that's difficult for people to understand is when you join the military, you don't sign up as an endorsement of any particular policy of the moment.","Writing fiction was a way to take the ideas that troubled me or confused me and put them under pressure.","At least for me, writing a book is continual exposure to blind spots. There were things I wanted to be true and wanted to believe, but it always got more complicated in the fiction.","There's a tradition of public service in my family. I'm one of three boys that joined the military. My father was in the Peace Corps.","With fiction, you can take something that bothers you, or that you don't have in clear focus, and you can put it under as much stress as you want. Really get underneath the skin. With nonfiction, you're restricted to what happened.","There's a tendency to look at anybody who joined the military as if they underwrote everything that happened policy-wise. That's not really the case. I have a friend who both protested the Iraq War and joined the military, and ended up serving two deployments in Afghanistan.","Certainly, my exposure in high school to writers like Flannery O'Connor, Shusaku Endo, Fyodor Dostoevsky and Graham Greene was formative.","When I was in Marine training I memorised 'The Waste Land,' which was a significant experience in terms of really breaking apart language and thinking about how the different voices in that poem function.","I write in coffee shops, libraries, parks, museums. I get antsy and then get on my bike and go someplace else, letting the ideas spin around in my head as I dodge taxis.","I love opera. I love jazz, especially Mingus. This makes me sound highbrow. I'm not.","I grew up a little north of New York City and went to high school at Regis, an all-boys tuition-free high school in Manhattan.","I ended up going to Dartmouth, and I did Marine Officer Candidate School during my junior summer.","There's something odd about working 24/7, being consumed with everything that's happening in Iraq, and then coming back to the country that ordered you over there only to realize that a lot of Americans are not really paying attention.","I did try to write in Iraq, and I failed. I think you just don't have the brain space for it.","I have, for a very long time, been a huge admirer of Marilynne Robinson, whose work I just love.","Fiction is the best way I know how to think something through.","You come back from war, and you have a certain authority to talk about war.","In a strange way, you have to have a certain amount of distance from a thing in order to be able to write about it.","People lie to themselves all the time about what they've been through and what it means - I'm no exception. But you write those lies down - lies that really matter to you and that are really painful to let go of because they've become a part of who you are - and they don't work.","Supposedly, going to war initiates you into this gnostic priesthood of people who've had a liminal experience forever separating them from civilians. Except... you go there, and it is what it is. A form of human activity as varied as any other.","Treating war as farce is one way soldiers deal with it.","War is too strange to process alone.","We're so used to using military terminology in civilian speech that we forget those terms might mean something very specific.","In State of the Union addresses, I always look at the foreign policy and military parts first, which are generally pretty minimal.","You're not supposed to risk your life just for the physical safety of American citizens - you're supposed to risk your life for American ideals as well.","Even if torture works, what is the point of 'defending' America using a tactic that is a fundamental violation of what America ought to mean?","'Redeployment' is a military term. It means to transfer a unit from one area to another.","Oftentimes, discussion of war gets flattened to a discussion of trauma.","Prayer in a combat zone serves exactly the same purpose as it does in peacetime. In war, the stakes are life and death, true; but if you believe in God and in the notion of a human soul, then we are always making decisions of tremendous significance.","The First Battle of Fallujah was called off in part because of the intensity of non-U.S. media coverage of civilian casualties from outlets like Al Jazeera.","I'm not anti-war. I served in a war, and I served proudly. But just or not, necessary or not, war is the industrial-scale slaughter of other humans.","I never thought anyone would pity me because of my time in the Marine Corps.","Pity sidesteps complexity in favor of narratives that we're comfortable with, reducing the nuances of a person's experience to a sound bite.","I didn't want to write a 'this is how it is' Iraq book, because the Iraq War is an intensely complicated variety of things.","It's very strange getting out of the military, when you've lived in Iraq, and people you know are going overseas again and again. Some of them are getting injured.","If you're going to write about war, the ugly side is inevitable. Suffering and death are obviously part of war.","I like the ethos of the military and the idea of joining an institution in which, at the very least, everyone who signs up believes in something.","For me, leaving the Marine Corps was more disorienting than returning home.","I've certainly thought a lot more about things like tyranny and patriotism and violence. I think I found some kind of clarity - definitely a thicker understanding.","The notion that war forever separates veterans from the rest of mankind has been long embedded in our collective consciousness.","The Iraq I returned from was, in my mind, a fairly simple place. By which I mean it had little relationship to reality. It's only with time and the help of smart, empathetic friends willing to pull through many serious conversations that I've been able to learn more about what I witnessed.","If we fetishize trauma as incommunicable, then survivors are trapped - unable to feel truly known by their nonmilitary friends and family.","Political novels are full of pitfalls, particularly for a novelist with strong political leanings.","In the Marine Corps, you meet this really broad segment of the country; you're working with people from all kinds of backgrounds. And it exposes you to the American military, particularly the American military at war.","People should be able to tell stories that are important to them to try and understand what they mean. I don't think you figure anything out on your own. Certainly not war stories.","It's often difficult to get perspective on your own stories, on your own experiences, without talking them through with someone who is genuinely interested in thinking about them. And that's the key.","There's a tradition in war writing that the veteran goes over and sees the truth of war and comes back. And I'm skeptical of that.","I think that just because you've been through an experience doesn't make you the ultimate arbiter of what it means. We figure things out; we work things out through the help of other people who can engage with us but also be intelligently critical.","I was studying with Peter Carey, Colum McCann; but also, my fellow students were really critical readers for me.","Certainly, when I'd left Iraq back in 2008, I'd been proud of my service, but whether we'd been successful or not was still an open question.","The Cold War provided justification for a larger peacetime military, since we were never really at peace, or so the argument went.","Less than 1 percent of American have served in 12 years of war, and serious public conversation about military policy is sorely lacking.","When I tell stories about Iraq, the ones people react to are always the stories of violence. This is strange for me."],"Phil Knight":["There is an immutable conflict at work in life and in business, a constant battle between peace and chaos. Neither can be mastered, but both can be influenced. How you go about that is the key to success.","When I took the entrepreneurship class at Stanford, the first lecture was about an entrepreneur and his personality. They described it as being different than a businessman, who is an overall scientific manager.","Any entrepreneur has to prepare for a lot of dark days, and they've got to really like what they are doing, and they have to have a reason for it to succeed.","The trouble in America is not that we are making too many mistakes, but that we are making too few.","I didn't say I'm walking away. I said I was stepping down as chairman. I won't walk away. I'll be carried away.","When you really understand who you are, it enables you to fight and believe.","A shoe dog is somebody that really loves shoes, and that was me. I was a runner... that became important to me, and it's been with me ever since.","Every businessman, or every person who has a passion for his work, is torn for the time spent at work and the time spent with your family.","I think I'm not a natural-born salesman, for sure, but If I have a product I really believe in, I can overcome some of the shyness and get through the things that aren't natural to me.","We knew we could fail; we just didn't think we would.","I think everyone born in Oregon is an environmentalist by birth.","I do believe that international trade agreements benefit both nations, always.","We wanted Nike to be the world's best sports and fitness company. Once you say that, you have a focus. You don't end up making wing tips or sponsoring the next Rolling Stones world tour.","I know when the Berlin wall went down and I walked into what was East Berlin and saw two big Nike banners - that gave me a chill.","Up until the time I was 14 years old, I was sure that I was going to be a big-league baseball player. But that dream came to a rude awakening when I got cut from my high school baseball team.","I don't consider myself enigmatic, but I don't spend a lot of time thinking about my public persona.","I'm Phil Knight, and I don't believe in advertising.","I've said many times that I might as well have webs between my toes.","Running is a basic ingredient for your health, just as much as eating and sleeping, but going out for a run by yourself and taking a moment to think also creates a certain peace.","In running, the only equipment that really matters - at least the mentality was in those days - were the pair of shoes that you wore.","If there was no Bill Bowerman, there would have been no me. He had about as much of an impact on my life as any one person could have. He taught me about competition and ingrained it in me. He taught me not to praise ordinary performances.","I still get real nervous when I go in front of more than two people.","At first, we couldn't be establishment, because we didn't have any money. We were guerrilla marketers, and we still are, a little bit. But, as we became No. 1 in our industry, we've had to modify our culture and become a bit more planned.","Sports is like rock 'n' roll. Both are dominant cultural forces, both speak an international language, and both are all about emotions.","We could see that he was a charismatic guy who jumps over the moon and is very competitive, but nobody could have predicted what he would become to our culture.","You can't explain much in 60 seconds, but when you show Michael Jordan, you don't have to. It's that simple.","Meeting sports athletes that are the best in the world is a thrill to this day.","Obviously, the bulk of my Nike shares have been set up in a trust.","No parent should have their child die before he or she does.","If you're trying to get into the sports business, you really have to find a niche.","If there's one thing, I've been pretty good at evaluating people.","We took advantage of the running boom, which became the jogging boom, which became the fitness boom... and we've benefited from all of that.","When we changed from Tiger to Nike, we had to have a design for the shoe. And where do you go to? There's no 'dial 9-1-1' for design.","I think a businessman can be an artist just as much as a writer or a sculptor, so I'm real proud of what the company has become.","There is no drama like the drama on the athletic field.","I've been fortunate to be around good people.","The thing that got us going early was the running boom. And then, I think, we rode the Jordan bit, which then kind of crossed us over into the pop culture."],"Phil LaMarr":["Quentin Tarantino was fantastic. I mean, he can be almost unbearable as a person. At a party, you can't get a word in edgewise for, like, an hour. But as a director, he is so completely open and just... present.","It's interesting, because I've worked with people who are just not nice people, and I've worked with people who are crazy, and the difference is: crazy is much worse.","I was such a 'Star Wars' fan. That was my generation.","On 'MADtv,' I discovered I could do Billy Crystal. 'Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 68th Annual Academy Awards!' Surprisingly, there's more call for that one than you'd think.","Sometimes when you do voices next to each other, especially when you're first starting out, they tend to bleed into each other. Working on a show like 'Futurama,' we do multiple characters there, but we've been doing it for a while, so the voices are really well-defined in our heads.","In video games and animation, you find that the toughest things to make different are the things that aren't words: grunts, groans, gasps.","If you're doing an animated comedy on the same channel as 'South Park,' no one can really tell you anything. The bar has been set so high.","My very first professional job was a cartoon, doing voices for the Mr. T cartoon in high school.","I played Dungeons & Dragons and have read comic books since I was a kid.","Say what you will about the leadership of 'SNL,' they have crafted an institution as opposed to just running a show. I don't think that's by accident."],"Phil Lesh":["We sing a little song before we eat, a little blessing before we eat, and it's really - we're thanking the Lord and the Earth for the food that we eat, and it really brings you together in a profound kind of way.","Not that there weren't great shows, and not that there wasn't plenty of fine music played. It's just that the consistency and the height of where we could take it, with the help of the audience, was less, I felt, in the '90s.","There was always so much encouragement, to just really take it and run with it, from Deadheads.","To sing a simple round is truly an enlightening experience.","In a way, it's my way of dealing with, finding closure with Grateful Dead music, and giving thanks in a way to Jerry and Bob and all the guys in the band for making up this wonderful music.","Actually, the year anniversary of what you just heard, my son Grahame and I are going to be in a play together, and I'm acting for the first time in front of an audience that doesn't consist of a high school drama class.","And the input that we always got from Deadheads, at the moment of making the music, was always a factor.","Especially in the realm of bringing an opportunity to do something creative to people, as I said, who wouldn't ordinarily have that opportunity. I think that's very important.","Michael is the kind of guy who has rhythm; he has rock'n'roll in his soul, whether he really plays it or not.","So, in the course of events, I had an opportunity to come in contact with Colin Matthews, through the Rex Foundation sponsoring recordings of various music that was being recorded over there.","I mean, sports are big, big, big business.","So what it boils down to, in my humble opinion, is that we need to support the arts in schools, and at every other level in the education of children.","And that format was - we'd been using that format, I guess, since the late '70s, and it was starting to get very predictable. In other words, certain songs would surface in the same points in the set every so often; it was like rotation.","But we were really locked in to that kind of format, and as the '90s wore on, it became for me more solidified, in that sense that there weren't as many of those magical shows that were just magic all the way through as there had been in earlier years.","Of course, we didn't survive to play all the way through the '90s, so I can say that - as I said, everybody in the band was aware of this, and we trying to figure out ways to make it different.","And there was a movement afoot to take another year off, and if we had been able to do that, and rethink everything, I think when we came back it would have been very different.","When the band would leave the stage, and then the audience would just take over, and keep the groove goin'.","Because, first of all, we were becoming aware during that tour that there was a group of people that was following the band around, and they weren't interested in coming in to the shows, they were just interested in hangin' out outside and tryin' to break in.","In St. Louis, some people were hurt seriously when some fans got on top of a roof that was where other fans were underneath it, at a park somewhere, and it collapsed.","Bruce's band is so different from the Grateful Dead; there's no lead guitar player, for one thing.","Yes, Pluton, actually, in the play. And I play him in my most stentorian voice."],"Phil Lord":["You need pencil miles to be a great artist, animator, or filmmaker, and the sooner you start making mistakes, the quicker you learn.","You always risk people misunderstanding you when you say anything.","As the son of a Cuban refugee and cousin and nephew to many Cubans on the island, I cringe when Americans visit Cuba for a fun island vacation.","The great ideas start flowing when you stop thinking about the obvious way of doing it.","I was short until my senior year. It's just, like, your social status is so dependent on how quickly you hit puberty, basically.","It was kind of fun to make 'Cloudy,' which has such a stylized look, and then do 'LEGO,' which, while it's stylized, is also photo-real.","The hardest thing to do with an animated movie is to not make it feel synthetic: to feel like it's handmade, where you can sense the human hand in it.","That's the beauty of the animation process: It takes so long, you have so many chances to improve it.","I would love to wear, like, twee Wes Anderson suits everywhere and not get made fun of.","I wish I could remember people's names. I'm supposed to remember so many.","Some people survived the neolithic age by being brave, others by being cowardly and smart.","I think we're going to be very embarrassed in a few years when we see a lot more women film-makers. People will look back and ask, 'How did it take so long for you to figure this out?'","That might be my epitaph: 'It wasn't as bad as I thought. Here lies Phil Lord.'","A sense of humour is never a handicap.","We try to stay as open-minded about casting as possible. When you're getting things down on paper, you might even avoid writing down a name, let alone if they have blonde hair or this or that, to stop.","I wish we had fewer bad words in 'Jump Street.' That would probably be better.","We try not to have any vanity or judgment about genre or type of film.","Male relationships are deeply emotional and hard to talk about.","I apologize for the song 'Everything Is Awesome.'","Seriously, if 'Superbad' doesn't happen, I don't think 'Jump Street' ever happens.","In animation, you do so much planning ahead of time; it has to be so precise.","There have been funny sequels, but I don't know if there have been that many that feel like they're - you know - they're just as great a movie to watch, just as fun an experience but different.","I'm a big believer in the transformative, exponential power of art, like a reverse pyramid scheme.","We are so aware of how silly our movies are as we're making them.","It's easy to forget that when you take out all the shark stuff, 'Jaws' is a really beautiful human drama.","I'm a big 'Omega Man' fan because of how insane he seems, just driving around in that car really fast. It has, like, a very strange tone to it.","We like the challenge of a story around the most generic, forgettable man in the universe.","Batman is the ultimate in white people problems. It's like, 'Oh, I'm so rich and handsome, and women like me, and... something about my parents!'","I don't want to fail by being conservative; I want to fail by doing something no one has ever done.","Having to top yourself is a good problem to have.","'Zorn' goes to some pretty ridiculous places, but the real comedy is coming from these little observations about life that are not as outlandish as some of the bigger moves in the story. This is a guy who has magical relics and fights weird monsters and is also dealing with very basic work and family things.","I wish we were smart enough that, every time we had an idea for a script, that it was great right off the bat.","You can't play not to lose. You kind of have to put your ego aside and accept the fact that careers are long, and there's gonna be stuff people like and stuff that people don't like, and you try to get better every time, and always put something out that you're proud of. And let the chips fall where they may.","One of the things that has proven true in our career is that even if you take something that's as straightforward and classic as a father-son story, you can express it in a way that's totally unique to you.","You need to make things and not be so precious about whether they're any good or not. Because I have a secret for you: they're not good. They're flawed, and you need to find out what the flaws are as fast as possible."],"Phil Lynott":["I tasted freedom and I really liked it.","You can know that the final show is coming up, and prepare yourself for it mentally, but when it finally occurs, it's like a dream. You stand there feeling the love the audience has for you, and you think, 'Is this really going to end?","That's the nice thing about being a live act. I can get the audience, but it's for the moment. It's like, 'Can I do it tonight?' And you can see when people like you. But on record - and with the pen - it's almost for all time. Really, a lot more thought has to go into it.","I look upon meself as... You take a band that's made up of arms, legs, bodies... I happen to be the piece that talks. And does all that area of it, you know? I'm also very easy to recognize; the darkie in the middle jumping around with the guitar, you know. Dat boy's got rhydm!!!"],"Phil McGraw":["Sometimes you make the right decision, sometimes you make the decision right.","It's better to be healthy alone than sick with someone else.","My dad used to say, 'You wouldn't worry so much about what people thought about you if you knew how seldom they did.","If your neighbor has a completely different view on abortion, gay marriage, stem cell research, all of those things, you still are both Americans. Neither one of you is necessarily more patriotic than the other. Neither loves their country any more than the other one does.","We all have a social mask, right? We put it on, we go out, put our best foot forward, our best image. But behind that social mask is a personal truth, what we really, really believe about who we are and what we're capable of.","Successful weight loss takes programming, not willpower.","Take it from a guy: If you're in love with somebody, you will swim the stream, you will climb the mountain, you will slay the dragon. You're going to get to her somehow, some way.","You don't need a pack of wild horses to learn how to make a sandwich.","It's hard to see your own face without a mirror.","Awareness without action is worthless.","I mean, if you degrade someone, you isolate them, you control them, you call them names, you demean them. That's a horrible existence for people.","Relationships are negotiated and if you deal with ultimatums and authority all the time, then you're not going to get anywhere.","If you want more, you have to require more from yourself.","The most you get is what you ask for.","I mean, look, teachers don't do their job for the money, obviously, because we pay them ridiculously little amounts for what they put in. Most of them come out of their own pocket for materials and things to help the children and all that.","There's a big difference between falling in love and being in love. There's a big difference between infatuation and falling in love.","Don't wait until you're in a crisis to come up with a crisis plan.","You have got to decide, look, this is who I am; this is my best way to present myself, and I'm going to ride that horse to the finish line. Not everybody will like it, but that's OK.","You don't need a rope to pinch a stranger's butt.","Everyone faces the challenge of finding meaning to their suffering.","I tell you, if you're in the front row of the parade and you stop walking, pretty soon you're back in the tuba section. And if you want to lead the parade you've got to keep moving.","At the end of the day, whether or not those people are comfortable with how you're living your life doesn't matter. What matters is whether you're comfortable with it.","It's great if the in-laws themselves put up boundaries. But if they won't; it's up to their grown kids to do it and enforce them.","When you get married, your loyalty, first and foremost, is to your spouse, and to the family that you create together.","Now, my body fat runs around 18 percent, which is normal and, you know, kind of in the middle of normal, actually.","Eighty percent of all choices are based on fear. Most people don't choose what they want; they choose what they think is safe.","You're only lonely if you're not there for you.","A year from now, you're gonna weigh more or less than what you do right now.","If you're trying to get out of debt, you have to be willing to treat everything as expendable.","The truth is, I think we are a self-less society, not a selfish society. Because we're so busy now.","The problem is that for women, the average time is just over 14 minutes... men are left with about 12 minutes during which time they need to think of something to do!","If you've gone into a marriage and you haven't been clear about how you're going to handle money, how you want to raise kids, who is going to work or stay home or what have you, then you've set yourself up for failure.","There is nothing wrong with your marriage if you're dealing with bills and kids and the broken garbage disposal and in-laws and work demands. That's a normal marriage.","A lot of people do have tragic childhoods. But you know what? Get over it.","I've talked to so many people, men and women alike, that get overweight and their self-esteem just goes in the tank. They think they're judged. They think they're unattractive.","Life is a full-contact sport, and there's a score up on the board.","We teach people how to treat us.","Sometimes you just got to give yourself what you wish someone else would give you.","Nothing's funnier to me than laughing at myself.","I think I've got the best staff in television.","Every one of us have things that we believe about ourselves when nobody else is looking, nobody else is listening, nobody else is monitoring what we're doing. We believe things about ourself.","There are some sick people in this world.","I don't substitute anybody else's judgment for my own.","Parents need to dial in and know what their kids are doing.","I do not believe, even remotely, that you have to have a partner in your life in order to be whole, in order to be complete, in order to be fulfilled. You just don't have to.","Oh, everybody wears a mask. We all put our best foot forward. We all try and make a statement, I'm not saying that's bad.","Food is a coping mechanism; people are afraid of giving it up because then they'll feel confused and lost.","It's so much easier to tell people what they want to hear instead of what they need to hear.","God is a loving god.","The Internet is just bringing all kinds of information into the home. There's just a lot of distraction, a lot of competition for the parent's voice to resonate in the children's ears.","I'm embarrassed every time I look a teacher in the eye, because we ask them to do so much for so little.","Do you realize that you can't play the game of life with sweaty palms?","I've learned a tremendous amount from Oprah.","People are used to being coddled.","I grew up in athletics, where people keep score.","I just am not good at math.","I think every parent, every generation has wanted their children to do better and have a higher standard of living. But I think there's too much guilt.","I'm one of those that believes you can't be one kind of a man and another kind of president.","You need to listen to your body because your body is listening to you.","I think you're running into a lot of trouble if your idea of foreplay is, 'Brace yourself honey, here I come!'","If I was on the air and was just kind of a plain-vanilla personality that took the safe road and the safe way trying to please all of the people all of the time, I'd been gone in two weeks.","I have some wonderful friends from the Mideast that are as red, white and blue as anybody you know, that have been harassed, and I think it's a terrible, terrible thing.","Not everybody is some kind of media model.","Well, let me tell you, if you're 45, had three children and are post-menopausal, you're not going to weigh what you did the day you graduated from high school. Get that out of your head. That's a media-driven ideal that you're never going to healthfully obtain.","What I want people to do is what's healthy for them.","I mean, I'm very, very competitive.","Well, I'm not sure what pop psychology is, but I don't like it.","When I was practicing psychology, I used to tell myself if I ever get to where I'm just doing this for the money or I'm just going through the motions, I'll quit.","I'm not a politician.","As parents we're not nearly as computer literate as our children are.","You know, what we do know is that there is a high frequency of violence in the home of those who bully.","I don't care how pumped up or psyched you are to start a new diet or a new program - that emotion will fade."],"Phil Mickelson":["The object of golf is not just to win. It is to play like a gentleman, and win.","I think a college education is important no matter what you do in life.","The final group, on Sunday at the Masters, is the greatest feeling in the world for a professional golfer.","It'll be nice not to have to use my fake IDs anymore.","The only way to win tournaments is with the short game. Over half your shots out here are within 30 or 40 yards. Ballstriking is where I'm trying to improve, yes, but more to eliminate big numbers than make birdies.","I try to respect everybody out here: players, caddies, fans, media.","My family has reduced the effect of my career on my self-esteem. When I'm with them, they make me feel special regardless of how I play.","I hate to play a tournament in which I'm not contending. It's just not any fun for me.","I have come to understand and appreciate writers much more recently since I started working on a book last fall. Before that, I thought golf writers got up every morning, played a round of golf, had lunch, showed up for our last three holes and then went to dinner.","My kids and I sometimes will just sit in my office and talk about what the world was like 68 million years ago. Amanda, our oldest daughter, wanted to be a paleontologist for a long time.","I remember when I first came out on tour, it was Greg Norman and Nick Price. We forget how big Norman was, what a presence he was. I remember one of my first tournaments, Greg threw an orange peel down on the ground and some fan ran over and grabbed it. 'This is Greg Norman's orange peel!'","I love competing against the best players. I have a huge challenge, and that's to win a U.S. Open and complete the Grand Slam. I enjoy that challenge. Every year it comes around, I get excited to try to conquer that opportunity. I love it."],"Phil Niekro":["I remember going to see my dad pitch against other coal-mining teams, and he was successful with the knuckleball. I saw how bad guys would look like swinging, and how guys talked about how he could throw every day and didn't hurt his arm. That's how I grew up learning.","My dad played for a coal-mining team in eastern Ohio; he was a very good pitcher. If he hadn't hurt his arm, he probably would have got a shot somewhere. He hurt his arm one spring, didn't warm up good enough, couldn't throw a fastball anymore. Another coal miner taught him how to throw the knuckleball.","I never knew how to throw a fastball, never learned how to throw a curveball, a slider, split-finger, whatever they're throwing nowadays. I was a one-pitch pitcher.","There aren't many hitters who like facing knuckleball pitchers. They may not be intimidated by them, but they sure are thinking about them before they go into the box.","There's very few pitching coaches that I worked with that actually came out on the mound and told me what I was doing wrong with the knuckleball. Because they just didn't know. So I had to figure it out. I was on my own.","I would think every organization has pitchers who have good talent but just don't have what it takes to make it with what they've got."],"Phil Ochs":["It is wrong to expect a reward for your struggles. The reward is the act of struggle itself, not what you win.","The final story, the final chapter of western man, I believe, lies in Los Angeles.","In such ugly times, the only true protest is beauty.","The fortunes of the entire world may well ride on the ability of young Americans to face the responsibilities of an old America gone mad.","There is an urgent need for Americans to look deeply into themselves and their actions, and musical poetry is perhaps the most effective mirror available. Every newspaper headline is a potential song.","Step outside the guidelines of the official umpires and make your own rules and your own reality.","Does defending liberalism leave you friendless and perhaps wondering about your breath?","Even though you can't expect to defeat the absurdity of the world, you must make the attempt. That's morality, that's religion, that's art, that's life.","God isn't dead - he's just missing in action.","When they show the destruction of society on color TV, I want to be able to look out over Los Angeles and make sure they get it right.","Leaving America is like losing twenty pounds and finding a new girlfriend.","And if there's any hope for America, it lies in a revolution, and if there's any hope for a revolution in America, it lies in getting Elvis Presley to become Che Guevara."],"Phil Ramone":["Rudeness is something I just can't tolerate.","The record producer is the music world's equivalent of a film director.","You can only mentor somebody if they want to be.","If an artist wants to work with me because they feel I've made some credible albums and there've been things that are long-lasting, it's because those artists took the time and we built an idea.","If you follow anything that I've ever done, I never stick to one thing more than one year. I'm just afraid to get typecast.","When you get to know an artist, you find out the things that have peeved them over the years, and it's generally the stuff that has to do with somebody not wanting to do things their way in the studio.","I started playing the violin at age 3, and I was very fortunate because there were people who heard me who were influential in getting me auditions. By the time I was 7, I was playing concerts - it was just ridiculous.","There's a lot about New York that is unique, and there's always a culture and a subculture going on everywhere."],"Phil Rizzuto":["I like radio better than television because if you make a mistake on radio, they don't know. You can make up anything on the radio.","I'll take anyway to get into the Hall of Fame. If they want a batboy, I'll go in as a batboy.","They've got so many Latin players we're going to have to get a Latin instructor up here."],"Phil Robertson":["I don't worry too much about people hating or insulting me. I'm a sinful man, and I've made a lot of mistakes. People have reason to hate me.","Money can come and go, and fame comes and goes. Peace of mind and a relationship with God is far more important, so this is the precedent that we've set in our lives. The bottom line is, we all die, so Jesus is the answer.","I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me. We are all created by the Almighty, and like Him, I love all of humanity.","Two of the central ingredients to our family are food and faith, so sitting down together and thanking God for the food He's provided means everything to us. Prayer is a natural part of our lives - not only around the dinner table, but all day long.","We would all be better off if we loved God and loved each other.","If your woman picks your ducks, and she cooks and carries her Bible... now there's the complete package of womanhood.","I picked ducks in a tub in my dorm room. I'd hang deer in the doorway between the bedroom and the little living room in our little apartment there, and I'd skin my deer, and all the guts would go in the tub, and I'd sneak them out so my fellow students on both sides wouldn't see all that, you know. I'd clean fish up there and all.","You have to discipline your children, or they won't respect you, law enforcement or God or anyone else.","Everything is blurred on what's right and what's wrong. Sin becomes fine. Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there.","Basically, I don't ever move too far past the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus, because it's of first importance. And I make sure it's of first importance with anyone I'm talking to. It all comes down to that, really, when you get right down to it. So it's not complex. Jesus removed our sins and guarantees we can be raised from the dead.","We're trying to infuse a little good into the American culture. Love God, love your neighbor, hunt ducks. Raise your kids, make them behave, love them. I don't see the down side to that.","What people fail to understand coughing up sin and confessing it and giving it to the only one that can remove it, for crying out loud, we're all sinners.","I have bitten down or swallowed a few pellets through the years. My uncle had his appendix removed and there were over 100 lead pellets in it. He might have died of lead poisoning. Now that is eating a lot of game!","My message is to get human beings to love God, love their neighbor and for the life of me I just don't see the downside of human beings not being so mean to one another and actually care for one another and not steal from one another and not murder each other for their tennis shoes. That's the message I have.","Temporary is all you're going to get with any kind of health care, except the health care I'm telling you about. That's eternal health care, and it's free... I've opted to go with eternal health care instead of blowing money on these insurance schemes.","If I were in politics, and if you ever get me in the White House, trust me, there's a big change coming. What happened to America? We lost our roots.","If you simply put your faith in Jesus coming down in flesh, through a human being, God becoming flesh living on the earth, dying on the cross for the sins of the world, being buried, and being raised from the dead - yours and mine and everybody else's problems will be solved.","Genesis 9 is where the animals went wild, and God gave them wildness. After the flood, that's when he made animals wild. Up until that time, everybody was vegetarian.","We never, ever judge someone on who's going to heaven, hell. That's the Almighty's job.","I never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person. Not once. Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I'm with the blacks, because we're white trash.","I've never owned a cell phone and don't plan on ever having one. If anyone needs to talk to me, they know where I live.","It was about 5 years after I was baptized before the pull of sin finally stopped.","God-fearing people, once they're saved from their sins, they don't mind talking about it.","I'm not going to run for political office.","I don't use any of the terminology like 'left wing' and 'right wing.' I use language like 'godly' and 'holiness.'","I kinda liked ol' Shakespeare and them guys, you know. I went back and got my master's just in case. I thought, if I ever needed it, I'd have the sheepskin to show people no matter how dumb I looked, actually I was about half intelligent. I got the degree to let 'em know I wasn't as dumb as I acted.","I repented at 28 and turned to Jesus.","I turned from my wicked ways and embraced Jesus. The next thing I knew, good times had come my way.","We were so poor as kids. I didn't even see a bathtub, running water, hot water, commode - we didn't have any of that. We started with a humble log house, milk cow, garden-raised our own food, killed a hog every year in the fall, and had the meat hanging up in the smokehouse - that was our childhood, me and ol' Si.","There are two kinds of individuals on Planet Earth who do not have beards - women and youth.","Carry your Bible and live by it. There's a better chance that you will stay married if that much is true for either one of you - male or female.","I enjoy almost all of the game we kill. I only like to eat game that I have cleaned. I guess duck and dressing are still one of my favorites. We prefer fat green-winged teal or wood ducks for our dressing.","I make a mean pecan pie, and I have a great recipe for pralines - also using pecans. Pralines take a lot of patience, and patience is a must in the duck blind as well as in the kitchen. Good things come to those who wait.","I told Miss Kay we need to make sure our children don't turn out like I turned out, so they were raised up around biblical instruction. That mixed with discipline - the discipline code, I call it. They just had a lifestyle of seeing their parents do good things.","I'm as much of a homophobe as Jesus was. The people who are participating in homosexual behavior, they need to know that I love them.","There's one race on this planet. It's called the human race. We're all the same. To me, there is absolutely nothing that has color to do with it.","I'm a highly-educated man, maybe a shocker to some. I have a master's degree. I'm no dumbo.","I don't own a cell phone. I've never turned on a computer in my life.","My mission today is to go forth and tell people about why I follow Christ and also what the Bible teaches, and part of that teaching is that women and men are meant to be together. However, I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me. We are all created by the Almighty and like Him, I love all of humanity.","Always remember this. Television, fame, money - listen, here is a news flash for America. Fame cannot remove your sin. And all of the money you ever amass cannot raise you from the dead."],"Phil Roe":["When I worked in a medical practice, our practice provided the insurance. When I retired the next day to run for public office to run for Congress, I had to pay first dollar.","I got elected to run the government more efficiently, lower taxes.","I think our veterans certainly deserve and have earned the best health care in the world.","I'm a veteran. If I go into the V.A. hospital in Tennessee, I want to know that the procedures they're doing to me are being done properly. That is not unreasonable."],"Phil Schiller":["There's a little bit of pain in every transition, but we can't let that stop us from making it. If we did, we'd never make any progress at all.","We try to find better solutions - our customers have given us a lot of trust.","When the economy is difficult, people care a great deal about the things they spend their money on. Customers have come to understand that Apple's products aren't priced high - they're priced on the value of what we build into them.","Android is often given as a free replacement for a feature phone, and the experience isn't as good as an iPhone.","If you want a product that's thicker with a bigger battery, it's also heavier, more costly, takes longer to charge.","That's the Apple I want - I want an Apple that's bold and taking risks and being aggressive.","It's a world where you're going to have a phone, a tablet, a computer - you don't have to choose. And so what's more important is how you seamlessly move between them all... It's not like this is a laptop person and that's a tablet person. It doesn't have to be that way.","It's always been about making the best Mac we know how. Among the many benefits are making it easy to use and affordable, with great features.","Our approach at Apple has always been to make products we're proud to own and use ourselves.","When you take an Android device out of the box, you have to sign up to nine accounts with different vendors to get the experience iOS comes with.","Every company that made computers when we started the Mac, they're all gone.","There were so many things of value in the original Mac that it is still recognizable.","There's a role for the Mac as far as our eye can see. A role in conjunction with smartphones and tablets that allows you to make the choice of what you want to use. Our view is, the Mac keeps going forever, because the differences it brings are really valuable.","There's just something so amazing about being anywhere, and some music starts playing, and you just hold up your phone and can find out what it is. You never again have to say, 'That's a great song! Who is it by?'","It's really cool having the news in your pocket.","I use a lot of the Web 2.0 apps that I've seen out there, and I think there is incredible work going on there.","Sure, the labels and publishers get the rights for songs to be remade into a ringtone. So part of what we do is to work with those content owners to make sure that there are rights in place for every piece of content to be made into a ringtone.","The iPad is far and away the most successful product in its category.","I was pretty shocked at the appearance of the Galaxy S phone and the extent to which it appeared to copy Apple products and the problems that would create for us.","There were many things that led to the iPhone at Apple. We were searching for what to do after iPod that would make sense.","I'd prefer not to tell confidential information about future products.","From the beginning, the Mac has been about Apple taking responsibility for the whole thing: hardware, software, how applications can work, and, increasingly, Internet services.","There are times when we have to add resources to Apple, grow talent to do something that we weren't able to do before.","It's a little counterintuitive to people, that doing what people don't expect ends up being what people do expect. But that is true of Mac.","You increasingly are seeing more Macs than PCs.","The job of the iPad should be to be so powerful and capable that you never need a notebook.","The belief is more and more as we use iCloud services for documents and our photos and videos and music that perhaps the most price-conscious customers are able to live in an environment where they don't need gobs of local storage because these services are lightening the load.","With every project, there are things that surprise you with the meaning they take on as you start to use them.","Sooner or later, the headphone jack is going away. There are just too many reasons aligned against it sticking around any longer.","We got rid of parallel ports, the serial bus, floppy drives, physical keyboards on phones - do you miss the physical keyboards on your phone?","Any aluminum product may scratch or chip with use, exposing its natural silver color. That is normal."],"Phil Silvers":["Like with Berle, he was always trying to steal the scene, get a little extra.","Stanley Kramer? Spencer Tracy? No one turns down being in a movie with them.","They always lost but he didn't blame me because to a gambler, a bad tip is better than no tip at all."],"Phil Simms":["I'm not a guy that believes you've got to have a lot of experience to have success in the playoffs.","I haven't thought about it. I'm not capable of deep thinking.","I criticize a lot of players and coaches. But I back it up with facts. A lot of times guys get mad at me because someone told them what I said. I say, 'You're wrong: Go check the tape.'","Talk radio has almost ruined the sports fan.","Of course it looks bad when you're not executing. When things go bad, it's not going to look good.","Sometimes, it's good to have a tremendous star, because everyone understands he has to get the ball."],"Phil Spector":["The gun went off accidentally.","I felt obligated to change music to art, the same way that Galileo proved the Earth was round to the world and that the Sun did not stand still.","I'm dealing in rock'n'roll. I'm, like, I'm not a bona fide human being.","Love is an obsessive delusion that is cured by marriage.","People tell me they idolise me, want to be like me, but I tell them, 'trust me, you don't want my life.' I've been a very tortured soul.","When I went into the studio I created a sound that I wanted to hear."],"Philip Baker Hall":["Plays are a pretty big commitment. It takes a minimum of three months out of your life, really. And if you have family or kids, then at least during the rehearsal period for five or six weeks, you kind of say goodbye to everybody.","'Good Times' was with a live audience, three camera, and that was really intimidating. Because there were people on both sides, moving from set to set, and it was pretty scary. As I say, I didn't have a foundation in Hollywood. I hardly knew anybody. Just at the social level. I felt pretty isolated here, I really did.","Pinchas Perry, the director of 'The Chicago 8,' offered me the role of the judge, and he did not know that, 35 years earlier, I'd played a judge in the theater production. So life has its own little twists and turns.","'Mariah' was the first series-regular role for me, and that really came about because of 'Secret Honor.' That really was a direct result of that. Because now I had an agent and was submitted for that part, for James Malone. And... I was the casting director's first choice for James Malone.","Some directors don't say much. Michael Mann, for example. I remember on 'The Insider' he never had much to say. He would do a scene, just kind of nod, and then set it up to do it again. And you might do a scene 10 or 12 times or more, the same little 31-second bit. And you could tell he wasn't satisfied, but he wouldn't say much.","From the time that I was in high school, my life really revolved around live theater, so it almost feels genetic."],"Philip Caputo":["War - the ordinary man's most convenient means of escaping from the ordinary.","I'm a Midwesterner by birth, and when I traveled there, when I was young, most of the small towns were thriving, vibrant places."],"Philip Dunne":["There is no fence nor hedge round time that is gone. You can go back and have what you like of it if you can remember.","You can be much more alone with other people than you are by yourself. Even if it's people you love.","It's easy to understand why the most beautiful poems about England in the spring were written by poets living in Italy at the time.","My dear, since Eve picked the apple no woman's ever been taken entirely unawares. When a woman's kissed it's because, deep down, she wants to be kissed.","I didn't lead a very wise life, myself, but it was a full one and a grown-up one. You come of age very quickly through shipwreck and disaster."],"Philip E. Berger":["My colleagues have expressed confidence in my ability to articulate our conservative message and to provide new focus to our efforts in the General Assembly.","The decision violates both the letter and spirit of the law."],"Philip Emeagwali":["The hardships that I encountered in the past will help me succeed in the future.","The hardship of living in a refugee camp made me psychologically strong.","Eighty percent of Americans with HIV do not know they are infected.","The labs were happy that I was brave enough to attempt to program it and the $5 million computer was left entirely to my use. I was their human guinea pig.","Nelson Mandela and Malcolm X came out of prison stronger.","It is smarter to borrow from nature than to reinvent the wheels.","Our lives sometimes depend on computers performing as predicted.","When I enrolled in college at age 19, I had a total of eight years of formal classroom education. As a result, I was not comfortable with formal lectures and receiving regular homework assignments.","Nigeria is a West African nation of over 100 million energetic people. It is endowed with lots of natural resources but lacks human resources.","Due to financial reasons, I dropped out of school after eight years of formal schooling.","Adversities such as being homeless and going to prison has made many people stronger.","I have expertise in five different fields which helps me to easily understand the analogy between my scientific problems and those occurring in nature.","First, I identify an analogous problem in nature and borrow from it.","I dropped out of high school four times between the ages of 12 to 17.","I preferred to study those subjects that were of interest to me.","I wanted to become a mathematician, physicist or astronomer.","During the week that I arrived in the United States, I saw an airport, used a telephone, used a library, talked with a scientist, and was shown a computer for the first time in my life.","The 65,536 processors were inside the Connection Machine.","The Connection Machines owned by the United States government laboratories were made available to me because they were considered impossible to program and there was no great demand for them at that time.","The Connection Machine was the most powerful supercomputer in the world. It is a complex supercomputer and it will take forever to completely describe how it works.","Briefly, to program it requires an absolute understanding of how all 65,536 processors are interconnected.","The greatest grand challenge for any scientist is discovering how to prevent the spread of HIV and finding the cure or an effective vaccine for AIDS.","One out of every 100 American men is HIV positive. The rate of infection has reached epidemic proportions in 40 developing nations.","Because I am not formally trained in the medical sciences, I can bring in new ideas to AIDS research and the cross-fertilization of ideas from different fields could be a valuable contribution to finding the cure for AIDS.","Because I believe that humans are computers, I conjectured that computers, like people, can have left- and right-handed versions.","My focus is not on solving nature's deeper mysteries. It is on using nature's deeper mysteries to solve important societal problems."],"Philip Gibbs":["In front of us was not a line but a fortress position, twenty miles deep, entrenched and fortified, defended by masses of machine-gun posts and thousands of guns in a wide arc. No chance for cavalry!","It's better to give than to lend and it costs about the same.","When we got down from the ambulances there were sharp cracks about us as bursts of shrapnel splashed down upon the Town Hall square. Dead soldiers lay outside and I glanced at them coldly. We were in search of the living.","We who go out to die shall be remembered, because we gave the world peace. That will be our reward, though we will know nothing of it, but lie rotting in the earth - dead.","It was so quiet that morning in Paris that the heels of my two companions and myself were loud on the deserted pavements. It was a city of shuttered shops, and barred windows, and deserted avenues.","It was announced as a French victory by the French Minister of War. I did not see any sign of victory but only the retreat of the French forces engaged in the battle.","I am going to fight - I, a socialist and Syndicalist - so that we shall make an end to war, so that the little ones of France will sleep in peace, and the women go without fear.","From each one of them rose separate columns of smoke, meeting in a pall overhead, and through the smoke came stabbing flashes of fire as German shells burst with thudding shocks of sound. This was the front line of battle.","During the early months of the war in 1914 there was a conflict of opinion between the War Office and the Foreign Office regarding news from the Front.","But the worst handicap we had the prohibition of naming individual units who had done the fighting.","But do you know, I shall not be sorry to die. I shall be glad, Monsieur. And why glad, you ask? Because I love France and hate the Germans who have put this war on us.","All was well, until I reached the port of Havre. Three officers with the rank of lieutenant, whom afterwards I knew to be Scotland Yard men, came aboard and demanded to see my papers which they took away from me.","A friend in the War Office warned me that I was in Kitchener's black books, and that orders had been given for my arrest next time I appeared in France.","It is better to give then to lend, and it costs about the same."],"Philip Gilbert Hamerton":["We need society, and we need solitude also, as we need summer and winter, day and night, exercise and rest.","Have you ever observed that we pay much more attention to a wise passage when it is quoted than when we read it in the original author?"],"Philip Glass":["Traditions are imploding and exploding everywhere - everything is coming together, for better or worse, and we can no longer pretend we're all living in different worlds because we're on different continents.","What came to me as a revelation was the use of rhythm in developing an overall structure in music.","I travel the world, and I'm happy to say that America is still the great melting pot - maybe a chunky stew rather than a melting pot at this point, but you know what I mean."],"Philip Glenister":["There are some very good people in television, but a lot of fools running it.","Children change you. You have this overwhelming feeling of responsibility, of love - they're everything. They're yours. You know when you're cuddling them, cradling them, and you can smell their hair. I love that.","At school I was easily misled, but that's childhood. I remember I used to shoplift tins of Airfix paint and football badges.","I'm an instinctive actor. I just see the part and play it. I'm more interested in what isn't said - the silences.","My father was a television director, and I always knew I wanted to be in the industry, but I had thought my role was behind the camera as opposed to in front.","When you are working on a TV show or series, you just get into the routine. You get used to getting up early. It takes a few days, but once you are up and running, you get used to going home late, and it becomes this very repetitive cycle.","Acting is just a job at the end of the day, and it's a very strange one.","My brother Robert wanted to act from a very early age, and there was always a part of me that said we couldn't have two actors in the family because our parents would go mental. So I became a runner for the Robert Stigwood Organisation and, one way or another, worked my way up to movie publicist."],"Philip Green":["It's all about quality of life and finding a happy balance between work and friends and family.","Good, bad or indifferent, if you are not investing in new technology, you are going to be left behind.","I am a positive thinker. You have to have this positive energy to get somewhere.","People are always going to go shopping. A lot of our effort is just: 'How do we make the retail experience a great one?'","I wasn't a good school pupil. I was interested in business.","If you go 90 yards in a hundred-yard race, you come last. Usain Bolt slows down for the last half a yard, but for 99 yards, he is that far ahead that he can. In our business, you can't be far enough ahead. It is such a competitive marketplace.","I don't think there's anyone who can be unaware of the relevance of Kate Moss, the effect that she's had on the fashion industry.","I am brave, but I take a view. It is an educated view. I am careful. I am not reckless.","You've got to love what you do to really make things happen.","I think I pick more winners than losers.","I think everybody, from every end of the market place, from young through to old, wants to be fashionable. Everybody. Women want to feel like they're wearing the right merchandise, regardless of age. They want to be trendy.","When I've had a talk with someone, I like them to leave unconfused. No need for contention.","I could have closed down bits of British Home Stores to make more money but it's not my style. I want to make my money as a retailer, not by putting people out of work.","I was never going to be a scholar.","I hope and believe all the people that worked very closely with me at BHS for all those years, and some for the whole journey, will know it was never my intention for the business to have the ending it did.","I sometimes think less is more. If you cut yourself in too many places, it is hard to execute.","On what possible basis would I want to stop someone from buying BHS if I had tried to save it?","I could spend my life having meetings, a meeting to have another meeting, a hundred meetings to have another thousand meetings. It's not what I'm about. I don't want to have to get in a queue; that's not how I like to live.","You are forced to have the best data capture, the best information, when you have goods in hundreds of factories around the world, and the question is: 'Where is everything?' And how do you bring it all together?","They already know all about brands... but what 16- and 17-year-olds won't necessarily have is experience of the world of work. The more that businesses get involved with schools, the better, because businesses sometimes complain that students don't have what they require to succeed in work.","I'm in the retail business, not the circus business.","I don't like department stores. I had a chain of department stores back in 1994 which was Lewis's and Owen Owen, only for a short time, and I found department stores personally difficult.","It's not my style to blame anybody else.","I have a very clear conscience.","If I say I'm going to do something, I do it.","You're going to find England, unfortunately, is a place where you get a lot of jealous, envious, you know, negative people. That's how it is.","There is no reason why government should not be as efficient as any good business.","I used to leave my house at 6:30 in the morning, and I would visit 10 shops every Saturday, starting at the furthest shop I'd decided to go to that day, ending up in Oxford Street 12 hours later.","Arcadia was a typical venture capital deal, but I'm the adventurer and the capitalist.","I don't regret anything I haven't done.","Nobody can be a clairvoyant.","It is about attention to detail and then the minutest detail on top of that. I am an owner, and yet I'll argue about the sign on the wall.","When I am driving my car down the street, I try not to go down the potholes.","I think I've got a good feel. A feel for... being able to walk with different people. Or for being able to look at people and think, 'Yeah, I might know what they want to wear.'","Stand in my lobby at 5:30 P.M., and there is no one who gets out of the lift who is not on a gadget. No one is talking to each other. I get in the lift and say, 'Hello,' and everyone's head is down tapping on a screen."],"Philip Greenspun":["We're not a vocational school. If someone wants to get a high-paying job, I would hope that there are easier ways to do it than working through a formal computer science curriculum.","If I'd had more time or been a better writer, I would have tried to put the same ideas and experiences into a novel. But I didn't so I slapped it up on the Web.","Even the lamest page can be saved by collaboration.","The real challenge of being a flight attendant is getting people out. The training requires that they demonstrate they can evacuate an aircraft within 90 seconds, but of course, a lot of stuff that is easy to do in training turns out to be tough in practice.","Pilots enjoy the fun and challenge of handling the fancy machine.","An unmarried adult who cannot navigate the welfare system has no choice but to work, but a married working parent is constantly evaluating the relative merits of staying home with the kids versus bringing home that second paycheck."],"Philip Guedalla":["History repeats itself. Historians repeat each other.","Any stigma will do to beat a dogma.","Greatness is so often a courteous synonym for great success.","Biography, like big game hunting, is one of the recognized forms of sport, and it is as unfair as only sport can be.","People who jump to conclusions rarely alight on them.","Autobiography is an unrivaled vehicle for telling the truth about other people.","Any stigma, as the old saying is, will serve to beat a dogma.","Success is little more than a chemical compound of man with moment.","Biography is a very definite region bounded on the north by history, on the south by fiction, on the east by obituary, and on the west by tedium.","The work of Henry James has always seemed divisible by a simple dynastic arrangement into three reigns: James I, James II, and the Old Pretender."],"Philip Guston":["Painting is an illusion, a piece of magic, so what you see is not what you see.","I don't know what a painting is; who knows what sets off even the desire to paint? It might be things, thoughts, a memory, sensations, which have nothing to do directly with painting itself. They can come from anything and anywhere.","To paint is a possessing rather than a picturing.","Painting and sculpture are very archaic forms. It's the only thing left in our industrial society where an individual alone can make something with not just his own hands, but brains, imagination, heart maybe.","Usually I am on a work for a long stretch, until a moment arrives when the air of the arbitrary vanishes, and the paint falls into positions that feel destined.","I am a night painter, so when I come into the studio the next morning the delirium is over.","The painting is not on a surface, but on a plane which is imagined. It moves in a mind. It is not there physically at all. It is an illusion, a piece of magic, so that what you see is not what you see.","Painting seems like some kind of peculiar miracle that I need to have again and again.","Look at any inspired painting. It's like a gong sounding; it puts you in a state of reverberation.","In my experience a painting is not made with colors and paint at all. I don't know what a painting is; who knows what sets off even the desire to paint?"],"Philip Hammond":["More and more, modern warfare will be about people sitting in bunkers in front of computer screens, whether remotely piloted aircraft or cyber weapons.","It is in all our interests that the arteries of global trade are kept free, open and running.","When ministers in this government talk about investing in education and skills, about making the planning system work; about employment law reform and delivering transport and power generation and broadband communication infrastructure, we are talking about raising Britain's productivity.","There is a real sense of anger among many people who are married that the government, any government, thinks it has the ability to change the definition of an institution like marriage.","I remember the day after the general election when Harold Wilson had lost, I remember quite clearly cycling from my house in Hutton along Long Ridings and feeling what a relief to live in a country with a Tory government again.","Let me be absolutely clear: I think it is defeatist to sort of say we want to leave the European Union. We're going to try and change the rules and change the way it works and change the objectives that it has in order to make it something that works for Britain.","The military never uses a full word if they can create an abbreviation.","The North Koreans or Chinese may have a million men in uniform but it's about how you perform.","Historically, Heathrow has been something of a joke, outweighed by its excellent connections. We have to aspire to having an airport at Heathrow with two runways which is a world-class airport. It's a big challenge.","We have got this Damocles' sword of Standard and Poor's hanging over us, with the commitment they have made to review Britain's credit rating in the summer of 2010 after the general election. Everybody in Britain has a vital interest in ensuring that the triple A credit rating agency is maintained.","It is not whether an independent Scotland could go it alone and develop its own defence forces - of course it could - but what sort of forces would they be?","It is a significant gamble to assume that troops in our U.K. Armed Forces would volunteer for a Scottish Defence Force.","Scotland forms a crucial part of our Armed Forces which should not be jeopardised by rushed cuts or a rush to the exit from the U.K. Defence jobs are vital to the Scottish economy and yet independence puts thousands of jobs at risk.","Disruption to the flow of oil through the Straits of Hormuz would threaten regional and global economic growth. Any attempt by Iran to close the Straits would be illegal and unsuccessful.","To those who say Britain cannot afford to invest in infrastructure, I say we cannot afford not to invest in our future.","While I believe firmly in open markets and free trade, I also believe an open market needs a level playing field.","Sound public finances are the essential foundation on which to construct a better-balanced economy from the wreckage of Labour's boom and bust. But it is economic growth that will create the jobs and the prosperity for the future and enable us to pay down Labour's debt.","Britain is one of the world's most open economies. More dependent on trade than any other major country. Our success depends on our competitiveness and our competitiveness depends on raising our productivity, as our competitors are raising theirs.","Talking to the Taliban is a process the Afghans have to manage. It is their country.","Negotiating with the Taliban must be done from a position of strength. Negotiating from a position of weakness would be a disaster.","The great western error about the Taliban is to assume homogeneity.","You shouldn't send people out to do a job which you cannot afford to equip them to do.","We ask the military to be in a position that, if we ask them to do a task, they are absolutely able to do it for us.","We will build in Britain a cyber strike capability so we can strike back in cyber space against enemies who attack us, putting cyber alongside land, sea, air and space as a mainstream military activity.","Cyber weapons provide the tantalising possibility of being able to cripple the enemy without inflicting lasting damage on them."],"Philip Henry":["Prayers not felt by us are seldom heard by God.","All grace grows as Love to the Word of God grows."],"Philip Hone":["These poor wretches were stolen from their homes, carried to a strange country, and sold to servitude, from which they sought to escape on the first occasion which offered.","They committed murder, it is true; but their situation may have rendered it inevitable."],"Philip J. Kaplan":["I knew that if I concentrated on AdBrite, I could probably make a big company out of it.","It got so ridiculous that I was like, there's no way this is going to last."],"Philip James Bailey":["Simplicity is natures first step, and the last of art.","Man is a military animal, glories in gunpowder, and loves parade.","Respect is what we owe; love, what we give.","There is no surer mark of the absence of the highest moral and intellectual qualities than a cold reception of excellence.","Art is man's nature; nature is God's art.","The sole equality on earth is death.","We live in deeds, not years; in thoughts, not figures on a dial. We should count time by heart throbs. He most lives who thinks most, feels the noblest, acts the best.","Kindness is wisdom.","What men call accident is God's own part.","Prayer is the spirit speaking truth to Truth.","Envy's a coal comes hissing hot from Hell.","The long days are no happier than the short ones.","Let each man think himself an act of God, His mind a thought, his life a breath of God; And let each try, by great thoughts and good deeds, To show the most of Heaven he hath in him.","America, thou half-brother of the world; with something good and bad of every land.","Music tells no truths.","Imagination is the air of mind.","Poets are all who love, who feel great truths, And tell them; and the truth of truths is love."],"Philip Johnson":["Architecture is the art of how to waste space.","Don't build a glass house if you're worried about saving money on heating.","Houston is undoubtedly my showcase city. I saved all my best buildings for Houston.","Architecture is basically the design of interiors, the art of organizing interior space.","All architecture is shelter, all great architecture is the design of space that contains, cuddles, exalts, or stimulates the persons in that space.","I'm a chameleon, so changeable. I see myself as a gadfly and a questioner.","The first complete sentence out of my mouth was probably that line about consistency being the hobgoblin of small minds.","There's no such thing as old age. I'm no different now than I was 50 years ago. I'm just having more fun.","Concrete you can mold, you can press it into - after all, you haven't any straight lines in your body. Why should we have straight lines in our architecture? You'd be surprised when you go into a room that has no straight line - how marvelous it is that you can feel the walls talking back to you, as it were.","Architecture is art, nothing else.","The future of architecture is culture.","Doing a house is so much harder than doing a skyscraper.","You're going to change the world? Well, go ahead and try. You'll give it up at a certain point and change yourself instead.","To me, the drive for monumentality is as inbred as the desire for food and sex, regardless of how we denigrate it. Monuments differ in different periods. Each age has its own.","I wish someone would ask me to design a cathedral.","I'm about four skyscrapers behind.","Anybody can build a building, putting some doors into it, but how many times have you been in a building that moves you to tears the way Beethoven's 'Eighth' does?","Dullness is the enemy.","I got everything from someone. Nobody can be original.","I call myself a traditionalist, although I have fought against tradition all my life.","I guess I can't be a great architect. Great architects have a recognizable style. But if every building I did were the same, it would be pretty boring.","In my own work, I'd say I'm a classicist, but I look everywhere for my solutions. I don't study the toilet-living habits of my clients, although that's a popular approach. First, I think of every building in history that has been similar in purpose. Then I think of the functional program - that's a major part of the study.","I like the thought that what we are to do on this earth is embellish it for its greater beauty, so that oncoming generations can look back to the shapes we leave here and get the same thrill that I get in looking back at theirs - at the Parthenon, at Chartres Cathedral.","It is wonderful to be in the country in a glass house, because no matter what happens out there, you're nice and safe, you know, cuddled in your little bed, and there it is, raging storms, snowing - wonderful.","I used to think that each phase of life was the end. But now that my view on life is more or less fixed, I believe that change is a great thing. In fact, it's the only real absolute in the world.","I hate vacations. If you can build buildings, why sit on the beach?","All architects want to live beyond their deaths.","Maybe, just maybe, we shall at last come to care for the most important, most challenging, surely the most satisfying of all architectural creations: building cities for people to live in.","I like to be buttoned onto tradition. The thing is to improve it, twist it and mold it; to make something new of it; not to deny it. The riches of history can be plucked at any point.","Processionalism is primary - how you get from one place to another, the relationships and effects of spaces as you move about in them. That's worked out awfully well in the State Theater. I'm a 'straight-in' man myself; I'm too nervous, I like to know where I am. I also like to know where I'm going.","I haven't any wisdom - just a child like everybody else. I'm not as great as Frank Lloyd Wright.","I wouldn't build a building if it wasn't of interest to me as a potential work of art. Why should I?","Faith? Haven't any. I'm not a nihilist or a relativist. I don't believe in anything but change. I'm a Heraclitean - you can't step in the same river twice.","How does an artist know when the line that he just painted is good or not good? That's the catch. De Kooning was the greatest of my contemporaries in art, and he knew when he'd done a good line. When he didn't, he threw it away. I wish I'd thrown away some of mine.","The people with money to build today are corporations - they are our popes and Medicis. The sense of pride is why they build.","Purpose is not necessary to make a building beautiful.","There's only one reason for my whole life, and that's art. Nothing else counts; nothing else gives me pleasure; nothing else gives me satisfaction.","I get between nine and ten hours of sleep. Go to bed at 8:30 and get up at 6:00 or 6:30 if I oversleep.","There's no worse feeling than seeing my buildings and realizing the mistakes.","You cannot not know history.","Glibness will get your anywhere.","I always think of buildings in their settings, but so do other architects.","I guess I want to make money just like other people, perhaps more than most people.","If architects weren't arrogant, they wouldn't be architects. I don't know a modest good architect."],"Philip K. Dick":["The basic tool for the manipulation of reality is the manipulation of words. If you can control the meaning of words, you can control the people who must use the words.","We live in a society in which spurious realities are manufactured by the media, by governments, by big corporations, by religious groups, political groups. I ask, in my writing, 'What is real?' Because unceasingly we are bombarded with pseudo realities manufactured by very sophisticated people using very sophisticated electronic mechanisms.","Comprehension follows perception.","When I believe, I am crazy. When I don't believe, I suffer psychotic depression.","This, to me, is the ultimately heroic trait of ordinary people; they say no to the tyrant and they calmly take the consequences of this resistance.","The trouble with being educated is that it takes a long time; it uses up the better part of your life and when you are finished what you know is that you would have benefited more by going into banking.","The two basic topics which fascinate me are 'What is reality?' and 'What constitutes the authentic human being?'","It is sometimes an appropriate response to reality to go insane.","Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away.","We are living in a computer-programmed reality, and the only clue we have to it is when some variable is changed, and some alteration in reality occurs. We have the overwhelming impression that we were reliving the present - deja vu.","Science fiction writers, I am sorry to say, really do not know anything. We can't talk about science, because our knowledge of it is limited and unofficial, and usually our fiction is dreadful.","Strange how paranoia can link up with reality now and then.","The ultimate problem confronting me all my life has been the senseless injury to and neglect of my sister.","I am basically analytical, not creative; my writing is simply a creative way of handling analysis.","In 1955, when I'd write a science-fiction novel, I'd set it in the year 2000. I realised around 1977 that, 'My God, it's getting exactly like those novels we used to write in the 1950s!' Everything's just turning out to be real.","Drug misuse is not a disease, it is a decision, like the decision to step out in front of a moving car. You would call that not a disease but an error of judgment.","Don't try to solve serious matters in the middle of the night.","The universe is information and we are stationary in it, not three dimensional and not in space or time.","I used to dig in the garden, and there isn't anything fantastic or ultradimensional about crab grass... unless you are a SF writer, in which case, pretty soon you're viewing crabgrass with suspicion. What are its real motives? And who sent it in the first place? The question I always found myself asking was, 'What is it, really?'","The Martians are always coming.","Reality, by itself, becomes a story by Philip K. Dick.","If you can get them to see the world as you do, they will think as you do.","The core of my writing is not art but truth.","I am one of the elect, one of the few in the know, in the gnosis.","I am a fictionalizing philosopher, not a novelist.","I dreamed: I am the fish whose flesh is eaten, and because I am fat, it is good.","I want to write about people I love, and put them into a fictional world spun out of my own mind, not the world we actually have, because the world we actually have does not meet my standards.","Movies like 'Westworld' used ideas I'd thought of a long time ago.","I saw a segment of Douglas Trumbull's special effects for 'Blade Runner' on the KNBC-TV news. I recognized it immediately. It was my own interior world. They caught it perfectly.","I don't write beautifully - I just write reports about our condition."],"Philip Kaufman":["Whatever you think of de Sade, he was a complex figure and we should not look for easy answers with him. He was, strangely perhaps, against the death penalty, and he was never put in prison for murders or anything like that.","But you know, there's always a danger nowadays that films are gonna be brought up to Canada for budget reasons. And that's something that really concerns me.","Nowadays they either want to move the film to Canada or in some cases they go to Prague or Romania or they want to keep 'em down in L.A.","This one, even though it called for San Francisco, I think they wanted to initially shoot part of the film up here, you know get the exteriors and then go back to L.A. We really fought to get it up here and I think Paramount was really pleased.","That's a little homage in a way to that and also to create that sort of creepy atmosphere that Hitchcock did. Vertigo was one of his great movies that was shot right here in The City and it's about a woman and the psychological twists and so forth.","I shot a lot of close-ups on this movie 'cause there's like a dual mystery, she's searching through her haunted past to find some truth and she's also following an external mystery where she comes to think she might be the killer.","I read, therefore I'm interested in writers.","The truth is, I'm drawn to all kinds of things.","And I liked this extreme character of de Sade.","It just seemed to me to be a great story, set back in its time but something that seemed to have relevance for our time. Now that the film is coming out, it looks like we're back in another time where repression of expression is all the rage.","The danger is not so much in the economic structure of a society but in its intellectual structure.","To me, thoughts are fun and art is fun. The strength of our society should not be idle entertainments but the joy of pursuing ideas.","You can have a lot of unhappiness by not having money, but the reverse is no guarantee of happiness.","What's really interesting about that is that a lot of these words that were incendiary in their time now seem almost harmless and laughable, because they have this archaic quality.","Whereas European films have traditionally been able to go into adult relationships. I think there's a huge audience in America for those kinds of films.","Similarly, the Marquis is presented in this film as someone who would disturb the status quo and therefore must be kept imprisoned.","They are always very lax about putting restrictions on violence for children's movies, which I think is much more harrowing than sexuality for children."],"Philip Kearny":["The Rebel bullet that can kill me has not yet been molded.","I can make men follow me to hell.","I, Philip Kearny, an old soldier, enter my solemn protest against this order for retreat.","We ought instead of retreating should follow up the enemy and take Richmond. And in full view of all responsible for such declaration, I say to you all, such an order can only be prompted by cowardice or treason.","War is horrible because it strangles youth.","Oh, go in anywhere Colonel, go in anywhere. You'll find lovely fighting all along the line."],"Philip Kerr":["I will say that anyone who supports Scottish independence should go to Athens. Because nothing works. It is a disaster. It is a ruined, dirty place where people do not have money or future prospects. The day one after independence, Scotland would be worse.","Publishers just want you to write the same book over and over again. But why would I want to do that? It would be like putting on a threadbare dressing-gown day after day.","The hardest thing is to write about people. First and foremost, you have to encounter their humanity. That is the only way you can make them live as characters on the page.","As a writer, you rely on whatever makes you up as a person, whether those things are twisted and nasty or otherwise.","Religion was quite a thing in our house - we were Baptists. Some Sundays I went to church three times. If there was a talk on missionary work in the afternoon, I could be there all bloody day. But religion took its first big knock after Dad died.","I was a member of Corstorphine Library in Edinburgh, and every Friday night, my parents took me there to borrow books. I also used to spend nearly all my pocket money on books.","I don't think any of us know how we would react until we were put in a situation where we have to do something bad or do something good. I think I'd like to believe I'd act like a decent human being, but I'm realistic to know I don't know.","The mark of a writer is to make a story as likely as possible, and I've done my best to deliver authentic atmosphere.","Sport seems to be much more important to people than politics.","I always worry I've probably written one too many Bernie Gunther books and that I should probably give him his gold watch.","There is always a temptation to take things for granted, to get lazy, and to presume that the reader knows more than they do.","I think the context of an hour-long drama gives breathing space that you don't get in a film.","I don't really like heroes who always behave heroically. That's not interesting to me.","I write by hand and then transfer the text onto the computer. I like the process of actually having a pen in my hand. Things flow more easily for me that way.","I love sitting at my desk and facing a quiet day with a pen in my hand, and putting myself into a story. It's kind of weird, isn't it? I mean, to absent myself from real life and make up stories is strange, but I started doing this when I was ten years old. It was all I wanted to do.","If I weren't a writer, I think I might have thrown myself more enthusiastically into advertising. But, it's difficult to imagine being a diligent copywriter. It would be quite exasperating for me.","James Bond was an early favourite, although I didn't understand much of it. I read the Bible a lot, too. You might say that this was my favourite, since I seemed to read it so often.","I prefer to write books for children instead of reading them. But I do strongly believe in childhood and in respecting childhood innocence. I don't like books for children that deal with adult themes.","I used to play quite a good lead guitar, R&B style. Clapton and BB King are heroes.","My parents had never been to Germany. But I knew what I didn't want to write about, and I didn't want to write about Edinburgh. A lot of writers find Edinburgh fascinating, but I never did. As a matter of fact, I couldn't wait to get away from it.","There's a great tradition among the English of writing about Berlin. It's kind of a state of mind, almost. That even translates in terms of music. A lot of people go to Berlin with the idea that it's a state of mind.","History asks us to imagine ourselves in a period, but it's a very different situation when you're in that period and faced with those situations.","I always try to find a story in the margins of history, but I don't like to do too much that's improbable.","A lot of crime writing suffers from treading water. I feel an obligation to move the character on and not repeat myself. I try to fit him into a different period and a different agenda. That way, you learn slightly more about his personal history in the tradition of the unreliable narrator. It makes it more challenging to write.","Being British, we tend to think of ourselves as America's best friend. And as your best friend, that gives us a little bit of license to point out things that could have been handled better.","It's not easy being the world's policeman. No one thanks you for it.","When I feel I'm repeating myself, I'll probably pack it in.","The most interesting legal philosophy is German, so naturally I went to Germany, particularly to Berlin, quite a bit.","The fascination for me writing about crime in Berlin was the idea that there was this much bigger crime taking place in the background, a fantastically epochal moment in history which is just going on. That just sort of makes the whole thing have a greater resonance.","I really wanted to write the way Kubrick makes films - 'Strangelove,' '2001', 'Clockwork Orange', 'Barry Lyndon' - they're all so different.","There's something weird about the Scots. We are a troubled, slightly tortured race - the sense of the respectable outward character and, inside, the turmoil of something darker.","After a while, you get tired of being the official Scot and defending everything Scottish.","I think John le Carre is, at 77, the greatest living writer alive. He is a master craftsman.","When I feel I'm repeating myself, I'll probably pack it in. What will undoubtedly happen is I'll write one too many. The important thing is to recognize when you've written too many and stop there.","All nationalism is based on racism and hate. I'm Scottish; I was born in Scotland, as my parents, as my grandparents.","Scotland is the only case in the world where the poor part of a territory wants to separate from the rich part. If independence came, one option is to keep the pound as its currency, so that all economic decisions will continue to be taken by the Bank of England.","Sport crosses party lines and ethnic lines. It occupies a greater realm, and it's all the more disappointing when sports figures turn out to be like everyone else."],"Philip Larkin":["Death is no different whined at than withstood.","Life has a practice of living you, if you don't live it.","I think writing about unhappiness is probably the source of my popularity, if I have any-after all, most people are unhappy, don't you think?","Deprivation is for me what daffodils were for Wordsworth.","They say eyes clear with age.","Above all, though, children are linked to adults by the simple fact that they are in process of turning into them. For this they may be forgiven much. Children are bound to be inferior to adults, or there is no incentive to grow up.","Nothing, like something, happens anywhere.","You can't put off being young until you retire.","Man hands on misery to man. It deepens like a coastal shelf. Get out as early as you can, and don't have any kids yourself.","I wouldn't mind seeing China if I could come back the same day.","In everyone there sleeps. A sense of life lived according to love. To some it means the difference they could make. By loving others, but across most it sweeps. As all they might have done had they been loved. That nothing cures.","I can't understand these chaps who go round American universities explaining how they write poems: It's like going round explaining how you sleep with your wife."],"Philip Levine":["I'm saying look, here they come, pay attention. Let your eyes transform what appears ordinary, commonplace, into what it is, a moment in time, an observed fragment of eternity.","My sense of a poem - my notion of how you revise - is: you get yourself into a state where what you are intensely conscious of is not why you wrote it or how you wrote it, but what you wrote.","If that voice that you created that is most alive in the poem isn't carried throughout the whole poem, then I destroy where it's not there, and I reconstruct it so that that voice is the dominant voice in the poem.","But most commonly, it's one poem that I work on with a lot of intensity.","My temperament is not geared to that of a novelist.","I realized poetry's the thing that I can do 'cause I can stick at it and work with tremendous intensity.","Back then, I couldn't have left a poem a year and gone back to it.","It's ironic that while I was a worker in Detroit, which I left when I was twenty six, my sense was that the thing that's going to stop me from being a poet is the fact that I'm doing this crummy work.","The irony is, going to work every day became the subject of probably my best poetry.","I listen to jazz about three hours a day. I love Louis Armstrong.","I started listening to music when I wrote when I had three sons at home.","But I'm too old to be written about as a young poet.","Meet some people who care about poetry the way you do. You'll have that readership. Keep going until you know you're doing work that's worthy. And then see what happens. That's my advice.","I'm afraid we live at the mercy of a power, maybe a God, without mercy. And yet we find it, as I have, from others.","My father died when I was five, but I grew up in a strong family.","I have a sense that many Americans, especially those like me with European or foreign parents, feel they have to invent their families just as they have to invent themselves.","No one can write like Vallejo and not sound like a fraud. He's just too much himself and not you.","There'll always be working people in my poems because I grew up with them, and I am a poet of memory.","For sure I once thought of myself as the poet who would save the ordinary from oblivion.","Now I think poetry will save nothing from oblivion, but I keep writing about the ordinary because for me it's the home of the extraordinary, the only home.","I write what's given me to write.","My mother carried on and supported us; her ambition had been to write poetry and songs.","I'm seventy-one now, so it's hard to imagine a dramatic change.","I was very lucky to have a mother who encouraged me to become a poet."],"Philip M. Parker":["When you're looking at small languages, the population of speakers is so small that there might not be people with the expertise in science or agronomy to write optimal planting strategies for maize in the local language.","There are many forms of writing that are common, but also very formulaic, such as annual reports or economic studies. In those areas, people would probably be relieved not to have to write those kinds of things because they are mundane and drudgery.","Formula creation is magnitudes harder for computer algorithms than actually executing within a formula. But once the genre is created and the formula is known, then the computer can do the repetitive task of executing within the genre.","There are a lot of people, who want to be writers, who stumble at a blank page. You could imagine an algorithm that could give writers a first draft or a starter kit, so it could enable people to be more prolific in their writing."],"Philip Massinger":["Be wise; soar not too high to fall; but stoop to rise.","Malice scorned, puts out itself; but argued, give a kind of credit to a false accusation.","Patience, the beggar's virtue, shall find no harbor here.","He is not valiant that dares die, but he that boldly bears calamity.","Ambition, in a private man is a vice, is in a prince the virtue.","Let us love temperately, things violent last not.","Many good purposes lie in the churchyard.","Death hath a thousand doors to let out life: I shall find one.","He that would govern others, first should be Master of himself.","True dignity is never gained by place, and never lost when honors are withdrawn.","To doubt is worse than to have lost; and to despair is but to antedate those miseries that must fall on us.","I had not to this time subsisted, but that I was supported by your frequent courtesies and favours."],"Philip Morrison":["My piece in One World or None was the description of the effect of a single atomic bomb on New York City.","Neither our oceans nor our radar nor our fighters can keep us intact through another major war.","We did not speak in terms of strategy, in terms of overall economies, in terms of production and territorial conquest. We spoke of the impact of the bomb on the homes and the hopes of men and women."],"Philip Pullman":["We don't need lists of rights and wrongs, tables of do's and don'ts: we need books, time, and silence. Thou shalt not is soon forgotten, but Once upon a time lasts forever.","True education flowers at the point when delight falls in love with responsibility.","And before I'd got to the end of the first paragraph, I'd come up slap bang against a fundamental problem that still troubles me today whenever I begin a story, and it's this: where am I telling it from?","I had passed through the entire British education system studying literature, culminating in three years of reading English at Oxford, and they'd never told me about something as basic as the importance of point of view in fiction!","That's the duty of the old, to be anxious on behalf of the young. And the duty of the young is to scorn the anxiety of the old.","Being in love was like China: you knew it was there, and no doubt it was very interesting, and some people went there, but I never would. I'd spend all my life without ever going to China, but it wouldn't matter, because there was all the rest of the world to visit.","What I couldn't help noticing was that I learned more about the novel in a morning by trying to write a page of one than I'd learned in seven years or so of trying to write criticism.","Men pass in front of our eyes like butterflies, creatures of a brief season. We love them; they are brave, proud, beautiful, clever; and they die almost at once. They die so soon that our hearts are continually racked with pain.","For a long time I thought I was a poet, but that's a high title to claim.","For that reason you can't write with music playing, and anyone who says he can is either writing badly, or not listening to the music, or lying. You need to hear what you're writing, and for that you need silence.","I have maintained a passionate interest in education, which leads me occasionally to make foolish and ill-considered remarks alleging that not everything is well in our schools.","If you can't think of what to write, tough luck; write anyway. If you can think of lots more when you've finished the three pages, don't write it; it'll be that much easier to get going next day.","My only real claim to anyone's attention lies in my writing.","One curious thing about growing up is that you don't only move forward in time; you move backwards as well, as pieces of your parents' and grandparents' lives come to you.","What I do say is that I can write verse, and that the writing of verse in strict form is the best possible training for writing good prose.","Everything has a meaning, if only we could read it.","Argue with anything else, but don't argue with your own nature.","Adam and Eve are like imaginary numbers, like the square root of minus one... If you include it in your equation, you can calculate all manners of things, which cannot be imagined without it."],"Philip Reeve":["I don't travel much; I just stay at home and imagine weird places.","Even tiny children looking at a picture book are using their imaginations, gleaning clues from the images to understand what is happening, and perhaps using the throwaway details which the illustrator includes to add their own elements to the story.","As a child I always steered clear of science fiction, but in the autumn of 1977, the bow-wave of publicity for the first 'Star Wars' movie had already reached me, so I was eager for anything science-fictional.","I used to be very fascinated by Victorian stuff, and my best-known books, the 'Mortal Engines' series, have a sort of retro, Victorian vibe, despite being set in the far future.","I was fascinated by 'The Lord of the Rings' from about the age of eight, and that lasted well into my teens.","Moving cities are a fairly hoary old sci-fi trope - I seem to recall they were always cropping up on 'Doctor Who' when I was young, though I may be misremembering.","My first encounter with science fiction was reading the work of H.G. Wells when I was nine or ten, and I don't believe 'The War of the Worlds' or 'The Time Machine' have ever been bettered. Plus, I have always had a liking for Victorian and Edwardian clothes and contraptions, which tends to color the worlds I dream up.","I had no idea I'd end up writing four books when I completed 'Mortal Engines.' I didn't even think it would find a publisher.","I've just written a very gritty, non-magical take on the King Arthur legend, 'Here Lies Arthur,' and I'm currently toying with some other historical ideas, as well as working with the illustrator David Wyatt on some sequels to my Victorian space opera 'Larklight.'","I'm sure it came as no surprise to my friends and family when I became an illustrator and then a writer because, from about the age of five, I was one of those children who always had his nose in a book.","I still feel, as I did when I was six or seven, that books are simply the best way to experience a story."],"Philip Roth":["Life is just a short period of time in which you are alive.","Writing, for me, was a feat of self-preservation. If I did not do it, I would die. So I did it. Obstinacy, not talent, saved my life.","All that we don't know is astonishing. Even more astonishing is what passes for knowing.","Literature isn't a moral beauty contest. Its power arises from the authority and audacity with which the impersonation is pulled off; the belief it inspires is what counts.","Old age isn't a battle; old age is a massacre.","Unless one is inordinately fond of subordination, one is always at war.","The road to hell is paved with works-in-progress.","I said the screen will kill the reader, and it has: the movie screen in the beginning, the television screen, and now the coup de grace, the computer screen.","I write fiction and I'm told it's autobiography, I write autobiography and I'm told it's fiction, so since I'm so dim and they're so smart, let them decide what it is or it isn't.","The novelist's obsession, moment by moment, is with language: finding the right next word.","I've stopped reading fiction. I don't read it at all. I read other things: history, biography. I don't have the same interest in fiction that I once did.","Sheer Playfulness and Deadly Seriousness are my closest friends.","Writing is frustration - it's daily frustration, not to mention humiliation. It's just like baseball: you fail two-thirds of the time.","A writer has to be driven crazy to help him to see. A writer needs his poisons.","When you publish a book, it's the world's book. The world edits it.","A Jew without Jews, without Judaism, without Zionism, without Jewishness, without a temple or an army or even a pistol, a Jew clearly without a home, just the object itself, like a glass or an apple.","Obviously the facts are never just coming at you but are incorporated by an imagination that is formed by your previous experience. Memories of the past are not memories of facts but memories of your imaginings of the facts.","My goal would be to find a big, fat subject that would occupy me to the end of my life, and when I finish it, I'll die. What's agony is starting; I hate starting them. I just want to keep writing now and end when it ends.","That's what you're looking for as a writer when you're working. You're looking for your own freedom. To lose your inhibition to delve deep into your memory and experiences and life and then to find the prose that will persuade the reader.","Let me tell you about the nap. It's absolutely fantastic. When I was a kid, my father was always trying to tell me how to be a man. And he said - I was maybe nine - he said, 'Philip, whenever you take a nap, take your clothes off and put a blanket over you, and you're going to sleep better.' Well, as with everything, he was right.","History... is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.","I think I write and publish as often as I do because I can't bear being without a book to work on... I don't feel I have this to say or that to say or this story to tell, but I know I want to be occupied with the writing process while I'm living.","I do the same kind of rewriting that I do in the shorts that I do in long books - and that is a lot. The book really comes to life in the rewriting.","Routinely, when I finish a book, I think 'What will I do? Where will I get an idea?' And a kind of low-level panic sets in.","I work all day, morning and afternoon, just about every day. If I sit there like that for two or three years, at the end I have a book.","People are unjust to anger - it can be enlivening and a lot of fun.","I cannot and do not live in the world of discretion, not as a writer, anyway. I would prefer to, I assure you - it would make life easier. But discretion is, unfortunately, not for novelists.","As I see it, my focus has never been on masculine power rampant and triumphant but rather on the antithesis: masculine power impaired.","Just like those who are incurably ill, the aged know everything about their dying except exactly when.","A Jewish man with parents alive is a fifteen-year-old boy, and will remain a fifteen-year-old boy until they die!","I don't know any writer for whom it comes easily. Maybe John Updike - a story would just seem to come to him whole, you know, out of a personal experience. But the rest of us, I think, are not so lucky, and I had to work hard, yeah.","I have no desire to write fiction. I did what I did, and it's done. There's more to life than writing and publishing fiction. There is another way entirely, amazed as I am to discover it at this late date.","I don't ask writers about their work habits. I really don't care.","It was my great problem to solve: how to write a book, you know. And after you write one, you have to write another to prove to yourself you can do it again.","Is an intelligent human being likely to be much more than a large-scale manufacturer of misunderstanding?","As for the kind of writer I am? I am who I don't pretend to be.","Nothing keeps its promise.","Fluency can be a sign that nothing is happening; fluency can actually be my signal to stop, while being in the dark from sentence to sentence is what convinces me to go on.","Making fake biography, false history, concocting a half-imaginary existence out of the actual drama of my life is my life.","I needed my life as a springboard for my fiction. I have to have something solid under my feet when I write. I'm not a fantasist. I bounce up and down on the diving board, and I go into the water of fiction. But I've got to begin in life so I can pump life into it throughout.","Novel-writing is, for the novelist, a game of let's pretend.","You write differently in each book. It may appear to be similar to readers, but you're a different writer in each book because you haven't approached that subject before. And every subject brings out a different prose strain in you. Fundamentally, yes, you're contained as one writer. But you have various voices. Like a good actor.","My traducers propound my alleged malefaction as though I have spewed venom on women for half a century. But only a madman would go to the trouble of writing 31 books in order to affirm his hatred.","To read a novel requires a certain amount of concentration, focus, devotion to the reading. If you read a novel in more than two weeks, you don't read the novel, really.","I'm an Obama supporter. And if you're an Obama supporter, that means you had a hard time during the Bush years.","For all I know, I am beginning with the ending. My page one can wind up a year later as page two hundred, if it's still even around.","If I don't measure up as an American writer, at least leave me to my delusion.","I'm not angry; I write about angry characters. When I'm doing that, I'm happy. Just like when I'm writing about Mickey Sabbath being lustful, I'm not feeling lustful; I'm happy.","Fear tends to manifest itself much more quickly than greed, so volatile markets tend to be on the downside. In up markets, volatility tends to gradually decline.","I'm not good at finding 'encouraging' features in American culture. I doubt that aesthetic literacy has much of a future here.","I rarely, if ever, had another book in mind while I was writing the previous book. Each book starts from ashes, really.","Should you protect profits? Yes. But run for the hills? No.","With the draft, everybody was involved. Everybody was fodder. When you got to be 21, 22 and graduated from college, for two years your life stopped. If you had been running in the direction of your life, you had to stop and do this other thing which was, if not menacing, just plain boring.","At night, I read. I read for two hours. I just finished a marvelous book by Louise Erdrich, 'The Round House.' But mostly I read 20th-century history and biography. I lived then. I was either a child or at school or at work.","Of course you bank on your experience, but as a sounding board. It isn't that you write down what happens to you every day. You wouldn't be a writer if you did that.","For me, the passing of time has provided me with subjects I never had before. Subjects I can now look at from a historical perspective. Like the anti-communist era in America. I lived through that. I was a boy; I didn't find a way to write about it until many years later. The same with the Vietnam War."],"Philip Schaff":["The apostolic writings are of three kinds: historical, didactic, and prophetic.","Jesus Christ is the beginning, the middle, and the end of all. In the Gospels he walks in human form upon the earth, and accomplishes the work of redemption.","It is more than a book, it is an institution which rules the Christian world.","The living Church of the redeemed is his book. He founded a religion of the living spirit, not of a written code, like the Mosaic law. Yet his words and deeds are recorded by as honest and reliable witnesses as ever put pen to paper.","The New Testament presents, in its way, the same union of the divine and human as the person of Christ. In this sense also 'the word became flesh, and dwells among us.'","The style of the Bible in general is singularly adapted to men of every class and grade of culture, affording the child the simple nourishment for its religious wants, and the profoundest thinker inexhaustible matter of study.","To the first class belong the Gospels and Acts; to the second, the Epistles; to the third, the Revelation.","Christ himself wrote nothing, but furnished endless material for books and songs of gratitude and praise.","The New Testament evinces its universal design in its very, style, which alone distinguishes it from all the literary productions of earlier and later times."],"Philip Schultz":["I think one's relationship with one's vulnerability is a very delicate and precious relationship. Most people try to hide, disguise that vulnerability, and in doing that, you, I think, diminish a great source of power.","When a child knows that he or she is dyslexic, that it's the way their brain is programmed, and it's not their fault, that makes all the difference in the world.","Art's power of persuasion resides in the small personal details of one's own story, and if it weren't for my struggle with dyslexia, I doubt I'd ever have become a writer or known how to teach others to write.","I never doubted my talent. If talent was the circus, then I was its ringmaster and audience, applauding its every move.","I'm a painfully slow reader. And to this day, I mean, I love reading, and I'm very careful - very selective about what I read because I don't read very fast and, therefore, not a great deal.","I have to often read the same sentence over and over before I understand it. And I have to convince myself that what I'm reading is so enjoyable and so exciting and so good for me that it's worth the effort.","Repeating third grade at a new school, after having been asked to leave my old one for hitting kids who made fun of my perceived stupidity, I was placed in the 'dummy class.'","The word 'novel' carries, for me, a weight as ominous, all-consuming and unforgiving as any Job encountered.","Dyslexia lends itself to original thinking, not rote formulas, because you can't do the formulas - you think up your own method based on intuition and instincts. Creativity is trial and error, trying to figure out a way to do something emotionally and intuitively.","I never feel more alone than when I'm traveling. Alone and, to some extent, helpless. The world expects a certain level of competence and can be merciless when this expectation is unmet.","There is a gap in my work from '84 to 2002, 18 years where I stopped writing. I was working at fiction and other things and starting a school and getting married and starting a family, but I wasn't writing poetry for the better part of 15 years.","I do think that there is a profound reservoir of creativity and imagination in everyone I've ever met, and sometimes if someone is persistent and perversely obstinate enough to persevere, then they want to be helped. There is a way to help them.","I don't think I've worked with anyone where I haven't seen some progress. Now sometimes you can't take someone where they want to go, not all the way, and sometimes you stop, and they do it or don't do it on their own thereafter.","What I read, I read thoroughly and retain almost all of it.","I come from a family of Russian immigrant Jews who were all big storytellers, who would get together, and one would try to top the others' stories, and stories would get bigger and bigger. And the lying aspect, the exaggeration, would get large.","I eventually just imagined being a little boy who was quote unquote 'normal': who could learn like all the kids around me that I felt excluded from. And I imagined myself into one of these and into someone who could read.","If I get the idea, and I get some clarity on how I feel about that idea, then I can safely assume I'll find the right words. I do have that confidence.","Suddenly, I was reading these comics. I was looking at those bubbles, those dialogue bubbles, and suddenly there were words... recognizable words.","Most people try to avoid cliches. It's my ambition in life to try to get 'em right!","My imagination was a great place to escape from all the anxiety and disapproval of my life... I had to live in my head... art was a way of making myself feel better.","I was well into middle age when one of my children, then in the second grade, was found to be dyslexic. I had never known the name for it, but I recognized immediately that the symptoms were also mine.","I not only couldn't read but often couldn't hear or understand what was being said to me - by the time I'd processed the beginning of a sentence, the teacher was well on her way through a second or third.","I found many ways around my dyslexia, but I still have trouble transforming words into sounds. I have to memorize and rehearse before reading anything aloud to avoid embarrassing myself by mispronouncing words.","I think I was 16 when I had the thought of maybe being a writer. And this is complicated, something I only now understand, because when I was young, having dyslexia and not knowing it made reading such an ordeal.","I didn't learn how to read until I was at the end of fifth grade and 11 years old and held back.","I was 17 when I decided to write stories as big as cathedrals, overflowing with the kind of memorable and audacious characters Walker Percy, Ernest Hemingway and Saul Bellow created.","With my fiction, I focused on chapters and overall conceptions, while in poetry, I crawled along in the trenches of each sentence, examining every word for a sign of a deeper significance.","I'd grown accustomed to seeing myself as someone who, if fallible and unworthy, had nevertheless managed to do one thing well enough to get recognition for it.","Suddenly, everyone wanted to talk to me, it seemed. And not about my poetry: it was my dyslexia they were most interested in.","As a poet and a teacher, I read all the time. I know I read slowly. I like reading, but I don't read any more than I have to.","I write slowly, and I write many, many drafts. I probably have to work as hard as anyone, and maybe harder, to finish a poem. I often write a poem over years, because it takes me a long time to figure out what to say and how best to say it.","Letter scrambling and trouble reading is just a small part of dyslexia. It is also an auditory processing problem.","I can't remember a time when I stepped into an airport or train station without wishing I were somewhere else, doing almost anything else. Just thinking about traveling gives me the willies. Traveling and dyslexia don't really get along.","Being a poet, the advantages of dyslexia are many, affording me sensitivity to the musical nuances of language and the ability to juggle complicated ideas and narratives simultaneously.","I know it sounds strange to say, but the very technologies that have made traveling easier for most people - GPS, automated ticket machines, online schedules and ticketing, boarding passes you can print out at home - have actually made things harder for me.","Failure has been the great theme of my life, I think."],"Philip Selway":["You are never, ever gonna get a drummer to dis another one. It's part of the drumming rules, as important as being able to keep pace or smashing up hotel rooms. Drummers do not dis!","I think I needed the resilience of approaching my late 30s to come to terms with the resilience I required to learn to sing.","Listening back to your speaking voice for the first time, unless you're James Earl Jones, it's a quite distressing process for most people.","When I first started drumming, when I was 14 or 15, I started writing songs. I wrote for a couple of years, but when we started 'Radiohead' it became very apparent quite quickly that I just wanted to concentrate on the drumming.","Anything that broadens your musicality always moves the way you write drum or guitar parts."],"Philip Seymour Hoffman":["I know I wasn't as handsome as some other guys, but I was OK with that.","I didn't go out looking for negative characters; I went out looking for people who have a struggle and a fight to tackle. That's what interests me.","Creating something is all about problem-solving.","I think you should be serious about what you do because this is it. This is the only life you've got.","Being unemployed is not good for an actor. No, it isn't, no matter how unsuccessful you are. Because you always remember getting fired from all the restaurants. You remember that stuff very, very strongly.","Well, I think everyone struggles with self-love.","You can look at anything as a cult. Churches are cults in their own way.","The only true currency in this bankrupt world is what you share with someone else when you're uncool.","Sometimes I have a great day of filming and sometimes the theater strikes me better. It just depends.","The drama nerd comes out in me when I'm in a theater.","I like to come to the set with very strong ideas and strong opinions about how to do things. And I like also dealing with somebody who's like that.","I know some really great actors who are pretty judgmental people, pretty critical people. But they're great actors. When they're acting, that's the craft.","I think therapy is a helpful thing. I think everyone knows it. You do it for your life, you do it for yourself, because you want to explore some things, and get at the bottom of some things. It's about your life, the quality of your life.","It's important to say that actors can't act alone, it's impossible. What we have to do is support each other.","When you become a parent, you look at your parents differently. You look at being a child differently. It's an awakening, a revelation that you have.","Actors are responsible to the people we play.","I didn't have any idea that I would be able to have a career in film.","I have a fine level of recognition in the business and among the acting community now, so I consider myself one of the lucky ones. If I didn't think that, there would be something wrong with me. I'm grateful and thankful for what I've got.","I work constantly but I work at a lot of different things. You know, I run a theater company in New York, I direct plays, act in plays, in movies, so I try to keep it eclectic.","My love for the theater has always been a priority. That hasn't changed. I got into acting that way. The film work that came up was really a surprise.","People actually live with their id exposed. They're not good at concealing what's going on inside.","Sometimes I'm uncomfortable with the level of fame I've got! It all depends on the day and what's going on. I don't desire any more fame. I don't need it.","The foibles of my body are pretty much out there in the work I do.","The size of my head though is pretty abnormal.","There are a lot of things going on with my life right now that don't just have to do with career. So I have a hard time making decisions about work. That's really a luxury problem.","If I was a little bit younger I would worry more. I'd want to do one thing at a time but now I try to do a bunch of different things at a time if I can.","When you have a child, as anyone knows who has them, that's basically all you want to talk about.","I have so much empathy for these young actors that are 19 and all of a sudden they're beautiful and famous and rich. I'm like, 'Oh my God, I'd be dead.'","I don't get nervous when I'm directing a play. It's not like acting.","Creating anything is hard.","In life, do you ever really know if you're missing an opportunity? No, you really don't.","When you're playing someone who really lived, you carry a burden, a burden to be accurate. But it's one that you have to let go of ultimately.","Films are always a fiction, not documentary. Even a documentary is a kind of fiction.","There are characters in movies who I call 'film characters.' They don't exist in real life. They exist to play out a scenario. They can be in fantastic films, but they are not real characters; what happens to them is not lifelike.","Life's pretty funny when you're objectively on the outside looking at it.","I don't have a specific thing I want anyone to get out of anything I do.","My girlfriend's a costume designer in the theater.","I think directors should be confident in their leadership capabilities. I think directors should be confident in what they want to do.","You know the circus performer who spins the plates in the air you know, and he'll spin six or seven plates in the air? Acting sometimes is kind of that guy spinning all those plates in the air but in your head and in your body.","I like so many different kinds of music just because all I did was listen to the radio as a kid.","I didn't really buy LPs or go to concerts.","I've never been on a cruise.","Directing is a really kind of amazing thing, because you're helping others and, in the middle of that, you have to worry about yourself.","Film's hard when you don't have any relationship with the director at all and you just show up. Then you really are just a gun for hire.","The weight comes off, you know? If you stop with the bread and the pie, it really does. It really works.","My ideal weight is 205, actually.","I think I'm less anonymous than I was.","Well, in the theater, I think you're actually more responsible for what is going on onstage as a director than you are in film.","In film, you have to let go sometimes.","I had insecurities and fears like everybody does, and I got over it. But I was interested in the parts of me that struggled with those things.","My mum is incredibly intelligent.","To be fair to my dad, he is one of the brightest men I've ever met.","I've worked with a lot of characters that are unhinged. I've played characters that are unhinged. That's, like, my job.","When people don't know who you are, they're seeing your work for the first time. But if they've seen a lot, getting certain things across is a more difficult.","To act well isn't an easy thing.","Yeah, writers do hate writing.","Actors are investigators.","The film is made in the editing room. The shooting of the film is about shopping, almost. It's like going to get all the ingredients together, and you've got to make sure before you leave the store that you got all the ingredients. And then you take those ingredients and you can make a good cake - or not.","The idea that you have a vision of what you're supposed to be, or going to be, or where your kids are going to be - and that that doesn't work out - is always going to be something that's going to affect people and move people.","I think part of being an actor is staying private.","The ambition, the drive, the wanting to be the center of attention, the wanting to succeed... They're all inside me somewhere.","If I don't feel like I'm doing the job well, and I don't know how to get there, or I'm too scared, or whatever, I'm not a happy guy and I'm not pleasant. I'm not pleasant to be around.","I got sober when I was 22 years old.","Plays never feel like the right thing to do at the time.","Why you do something is always kind of a mystery to me.","I've had to make the transition from sweeping in for 15 minutes, doing my stuff and clearing out, to carrying a movie for the duration - in a dress.","People used to be funny about approaching me, but now they seem to think I'm as sane as anyone who's done what I've done in movies can be.","My soul is in good shape.","I don't want to repeat myself.","Good work is the only thing that would make me feel jealous or envious.","Vanity is something that will only get in the way of doing your best work, and ultimately if you're truly vain you care more about your work than how you look in your work. I actually consider myself a pretty vain guy when it comes to that.","If you're a human being walking the earth, you're weird, you're strange, you're psychologically challenged.","I think you ultimately have to love who you're playing. You have to have that kind of feeling. You have to have passion for the person.","I try not to plan that too much.","Ultimately what I'll do next is up in the air for me.","I've grown to really love musicals, you know?","It's hard for anybody who works a lot and has children. But I wouldn't trade it for anything.","You have to understand that crew members make movies so they're seeing a lot of actors all the time in their career acting."],"Philip Sidney":["Either I will find a way, or I will make one.","It is the nature of the strong heart, that like the palm tree it strives ever upwards when it is most burdened.","A true knight is fuller of bravery in the midst, than in the beginning of danger.","The ingredients of health and long life, are great temperance, open air, easy labor, and little care.","The only disadvantage of an honest heart is credulity.","For conclusion, I say the philosopher teacheth, but he teacheth obscurely, so as the learned only can understand him; that is to say, he teacheth them that are already taught.","Poesy must not be drawn by the ears: it must be gently led, or rather, it must lead, which was partly the cause that made the ancient learned affirm it was a divine, and no human skill, since all other knowledges lie ready for any that have strength of wit; a poet no industry can make, if his own genius be not carried into it.","Plato found fault that the poets of his time filled the world with wrong opinions of the gods, making light tales of that unspotted essence, and therefore would not have the youth depraved with such opinions.","It is great happiness to be praised of them who are most praiseworthy.","If you have so earth-creeping a mind that it cannot lift itself up to look to the sky of poetry... thus much curse I must send you, in the behalf of all poets, that while you live, you live in love, and never get favour for lacking skill of a sonnet; and, when you die, your memory die from the earth for want of an epitaph.","The poet nothing affirmeth and therefore never lieth.","Indeed, the Roman laws allowed no person to be carried to the wars but he that was in the soldiers' roll.","Our erected wit maketh us to know what perfection is."],"Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield":["An injury is much sooner forgotten than an insult.","Know the true value of time; snatch, seize, and enjoy every moment of it. No idleness, no laziness, no procrastination: never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.","Aim at perfection in everything, though in most things it is unattainable. However, they who aim at it, and persevere, will come much nearer to it than those whose laziness and despondency make them give it up as unattainable.","Whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well.","Good humor is the health of the soul, sadness is its poison.","Our own self-love draws a thick veil between us and our faults.","Idleness is only the refuge of weak minds.","A weak mind is like a microscope, which magnifies trifling things, but cannot receive great ones.","Inferiority is what you enjoy in your best friends.","If you are not in fashion, you are nobody.","The mere brute pleasure of reading - the sort of pleasure a cow must have in grazing.","Regularity in the hours of rising and retiring, perseverance in exercise, adaptation of dress to the variations of climate, simple and nutritious aliment, and temperance in all things are necessary branches of the regimen of health.","Judgment is not upon all occasions required, but discretion always is.","Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.","Let your enemies be disarmed by the gentleness of your manner, but at the same time let them feel, the steadiness of your resentment.","Persist and persevere, and you will find most things that are attainable, possible.","Politeness is as much concerned in answering letters within a reasonable time, as it is in returning a bow, immediately.","Hear one side and you will be in the dark. Hear both and all will be clear.","As fathers commonly go, it is seldom a misfortune to be fatherless; and considering the general run of sons, as seldom a misfortune to be childless.","If ever a man and his wife, or a man and his mistress, who pass nights as well as days together, absolutely lay aside all good breeding, their intimacy will soon degenerate into a coarse familiarity, infallibly productive of contempt or disgust.","The world is a country which nobody ever yet knew by description; one must travel through it one's self to be acquainted with it.","Vice, in its true light, is so deformed, that it shocks us at first sight; and would hardly ever seduce us, if it did not at first wear the mask of some virtue.","I recommend you to take care of the minutes, for the hours will take care of themselves.","I look upon indolence as a sort of suicide; for the man is effectually destroyed, though the appetites of the brute may survive.","Wear your learning like your watch, in a private pocket; and do not pull it out, and strike it, merely to show that you have one.","Never seem more learned than the people you are with. Wear your learning like a pocket watch and keep it hidden. Do not pull it out to count the hours, but give the time when you are asked.","Sex: the pleasure is momentary, the position ridiculous, and the expense damnable.","Whoever is in a hurry shows that the thing he is about is too big for him.","A novel must be exceptionally good to live as long as the average cat.","Being pretty on the inside means you don't hit your brother and you eat all your peas - that's what my grandma taught me.","There is nothing that people bear more impatiently, or forgive less, than contempt: and an injury is much sooner forgotten than an insult.","A wise man will live as much within his wit as within his income.","There is time enough for everything, in the course of the day, if you do but one thing at once; but there is not time enough in the year, if you will do two things at a time.","I sometimes give myself admirable advice, but I am incapable of taking it.","Every man becomes, to a certain degree, what the people he generally converses with are.","Advice is seldom welcome; and those who want it the most always want it the least.","Distrust all those who love you extremely upon a very slight acquaintance and without any visible reason.","Swift speedy time, feathered with flying hours, Dissolves the beauty of the fairest brow.","Remember, as long as you live, that nothing but strict truth can carry you through the world, with either your conscience or your honor unwounded.","Be wiser than other people if you can, but do not tell them so.","In seeking wisdom thou art wise; in imagining that thou hast attained it - thou art a fool.","In those days he was wiser than he is now - he used frequently to take my advice.","If you can once engage people's pride, love, pity, ambition on your side, you need not fear what their reason can do against you.","You must look into people as well as at them.","Politicians neither love nor hate. Interest, not sentiment, directs them.","Never seem wiser, nor more learned, than the people you are with. Wear your learning, like your watch, in a private pocket: and do not merely pull it out and strike it; merely to show that you have one.","The only solid and lasting peace between a man and his wife is, doubtless, a separation.","In matters of religion and matrimony I never give any advice; because I will not have anybody's torments in this world or the next laid to my charge.","The heart never grows better by age; I fear rather worse, always harder. A young liar will be an old one, and a young knave will only be a greater knave as he grows older.","Good breeding is the result of good sense, some good nature, and a little self-denial for the sake of others.","To have frequent recourse to narrative betrays great want of imagination.","Custom has made dancing sometimes necessary for a young man; therefore mind it while you learn it, that you may learn to do it well, and not be ridiculous, though in a ridiculous act.","Any affectation whatsoever in dress implies, in my mind, a flaw in the understanding.","The difference between a man of sense and a fop is that the fop values himself upon his dress; and the man of sense laughs at it, at the same time he knows he must not neglect it.","Honest error is to be pitied, not ridiculed.","When a person is in fashion, all they do is right.","Modesty is the only sure bait when you angle for praise.","Knowledge may give weight, but accomplishments give luster, and many more people see than weigh.","Knowledge of the world in only to be acquired in the world, and not in a closet.","Learning is acquired by reading books, but the much more necessary learning, the knowledge of the world, is only to be acquired by reading men, and studying all the various facets of them.","Frequent and loud laughter is the characteristic of folly and ill manners.","In my mind, there is nothing so illiberal, and so ill-bred, as audible laughter.","A man of sense only trifles with them, plays with them, humors and flatters them, as he does with a sprightly and forward child; but he neither consults them about, nor trusts them with, serious matters.","I find, by experience, that the mind and the body are more than married, for they are most intimately united; and when one suffers, the other sympathizes.","Patience is the most necessary quality for business, many a man would rather you heard his story than grant his request.","He makes people pleased with him by making them first pleased with themselves.","If you would convince others, seem open to conviction yourself.","Pleasure is a necessary reciprocal. No one feels, who does not at the same time give it. To be pleased, one must please. What pleases you in others, will in general please them in you.","The less one has to do, the less time one finds to do it in.","Let them show me a cottage where there are not the same vices of which they accuse the courts.","Wit is so shining a quality that everybody admires it; most people aim at it, all people fear it, and few love it unless in themselves. A man must have a good share of wit himself to endure a great share of it in another.","The more one works, the more willing one is to work.","Young men are apt to think themselves wise enough, as drunken men are apt to think themselves sober enough.","I am very sure that any man of common understanding may, by culture, care, attention, and labor, make himself what- ever he pleases, except a great poet.","The rich are always advising the poor, but the poor seldom return the compliment.","Men, as well as women, are much oftener led by their hearts than by their understandings.","Take the tone of the company you are in.","To govern mankind, one must not overrate them.","Character must be kept bright as well as clean.","Most people enjoy the inferiority of their best friends.","Our prejudices are our mistresses; reason is at best our wife, very often heard indeed, but seldom minded.","Gratitude is a burden upon our imperfect nature, and we are but too willing to ease ourselves of it, or at least to lighten it as much as we can.","It is always right to detect a fraud, and to perceive a folly; but it is very often wrong to expose either. A man of business should always have his eyes open, but must often seem to have them shut.","A young man, be his merit what it will, can never raise himself; but must, like the ivy round the oak, twine himself round some man of great power and interest.","In the mass of mankind, I fear, there is too great a majority of fools and knaves; who, singly from their number, must to a certain degree be respected, though they are by no means respectable.","Women are only children of a larger growth. A man of sense only trifles with them, plays with them, humours and flatters them, as he does with a sprightly and forward child; but he neither consults them about, nor trusts them with, serious matters.","Whoever incites anger has a strong insurance against indifference.","Words, which are the dress of thoughts, deserve surely more care than clothes, which are only the dress of the person."],"Philip Treacy":["Royalty is completely different than celebrity. Royalty has a magic all its own.","Elegance is all in the mind of the wearer.","A person carries off the hat. Hats are about emotion. It is all about how it makes you feel.","Somebody can feel elegant without being elegant. It's a personality.","How a hat makes you feel is what a hat is all about.","I like hats that make the heart beat faster.","Everybody loves things that sparkle.","Try on 100 different hats if you can, until you find the one that suits you best. It's a trial and error thing.","In Rome, I particularly love the history, churches, sculptures and architecture and the fact that you can walk along a tiny cobbled street and turn the corner to find the Trevi Fountain. London is evocative of other eras and full of history.","Wearing a hat is fun; people have a good time when they're wearing a hat.","There's a technicality to designing and wearing hats. A hat is balancing the proportions of your face; it's like architecture or mathematics.","Every day, I like to make hats that make people dream.","You always see a better side of where you're visiting when a local shows you around.","Hats make people feel good, and that's the point of them.","The personality of the wearer and the hat makes the hat.","There is no attitude required. The hat brings the attitude. And when people try on a hat they like, it is a bit of fun. It makes them laugh. You don't laugh when you put on a pair of shoes, but you do with a hat.","America brought us the baseball cap; it's one of my favorite hats.","When people think of hats, they think of her majesty the queen.","My mother had a sewing machine. I was never allowed to use it, but I was so fascinated by this little needle going up and down joining fabric together that I'd use it when my mother went out to feed the chickens.","Hats are radical; only people that wear hats understand that.","The classic hat image was during the Forties and Fifties, and Elizabeth Taylor was the epitome of that; she was the ultimate celebrity of excess and glamour, and she worked major sun hats.","Hats are attached to special moments in people's lives - weddings, or the races. In difficult times, people still get married; they still want to look their best.","Hats are for life's ultimate moments. They're worn at races, at weddings. Occasions many of us, who aren't royals and celebrities, only attend once or twice in a lifetime.","I grew up in the west of Ireland, and Galway was our local seaside resort. We'd go for one day of the year during the summer, and I have enduring memories of the sand and the sea.","People, when they buy a hat, they can't explain why they want to buy it or why they want it, but they do. It's like chocolate.","What I love most about Her Majesty is that she has kept hats alive in people's minds for more than 60 years. You can't think of her without imagining her with a hat or a crown. I would, of course, love to design one for her.","I remember in the early nineties people saying the hat was just for old women, but that's ridiculous.","I used to make clothes for my sister's dolls. I couldn't care less for the dolls, but I could make the clothes really easily.","I was just, as a child, very different from the others, and didn't really care what they thought because you know, a child doesn't really have inhibitions; you sort of gain your inhibitions later.","When people come and visit me and have a hat made, it's a little bit like visiting a psychiatrist, but they don't actually realize that.","The only person I never made a hat for was my mother because my mother didn't really - she preferred to make her own hats. I mean, she was intrigued by everything, but she didn't want one of my hats. She made her own.","I believe that I am a hat designer, not a milliner.","I always design the hat with the wearer in mind; otherwise, it's an inanimate object.","At home, I had seven brothers, one sister. I sewed clothes for my sister's dolls although she was grown and gone away. I was a weirdo but didn't think I was a weirdo.","I love the romance of what I do, although because of Isabella, Lady Gaga and Grace Jones, people think I have crazy customers. Sometimes I get more enthusiasm from the housewife who wants a hat and believes in it.","I grew up in a little village in the west of Ireland.","Fashion is an illusion. It's a multibillion-pound industry that has to appear frivolous. Designers work and work and work, all night sometimes.","I make hats for lots of iconic people, and that makes my job very interesting.","Women come into our shop for that ultimate moment in their life. They're buying a dream. They're buying a moment for themselves. That's what I sell - moments.","Certainly, people like Gaga have introduced a new type of hat-wearing.","People are dressing like stars, which is kind of fantastic.","I believe in a democratic approach to fashion: if you feel good, then great. You may not look good, but it's not the problem.","I believe in originality, primarily. However, it's important to know what there has been before to aim in that direction. Art history informs us. It informs our mind. I like to look at books, exhibitions, paintings, as a computer, subconsciously taking on information.","The success of a hat definitely lies with balancing the personality of the wearer with the type of occasion. Don't listen to those rules about face shape.","When you meet someone, you meet their face. It's the most potent part of the body to embellish.","Fantasy hats give you the possibility to dream.","I want to excite the eye through hatmaking.","I do say I'm a specialist in divas. Name a diva - I've worked with 'em.","I must point out - Sarah Jessica Parker is not a diva - she's one of these pop culture characters that everybody likes.","Not long ago, a hat was a conformist accessory. Then the 1960s came along, and young people didn't want to wear hats.","Hat-making is laborious and time-consuming. It's a very tactile medium, and you can develop the skills, but it's one of those things: you either have it, or you don't. I love bringing something to fruition with my hands that gives people pleasure.","Hats are really for ultimate occasions, so when I make one, I try to do something different, something noticeable.","When you're wearing something on your head, you feel beautiful.","Gaga is an entertainer, so a hat for her is part of the illusion of entertaining.","Often, what makes my job so exciting is designing for the mother whose dream has been to wear one of my hats at her child's wedding. I feel as responsible for making her feel like a million dollars as I do for somebody in the public eye.","I empathise with the fact that people want to look their best. A hat is all about how it makes you feel - it's so much better than a nip and tuck, and a lot less painful.","I love the shape of cars. They are very inspiring as modern pieces of machinery. I can't drive, but I do like the look of them.","I am very proud to be Irish.","I'm representative of 21st century Irish design, so I promote Irishness all over the world wherever I go.","I particularly like to travel for work because you see a completely different side of the country you're visiting.","Shopping can be a nightmare - first finding something to wear and then finding something to go with it, it's so difficult when there's so much choice. It can feel like entering a battleground.","So my advice is to always choose something simpler - an expressive outfit, plus a hat, can be frightening.","Hats are the epitome of Englishness, and a royal wedding is the penultimate moment for a hat designer. I'm Irish, but I am a royalist and I believe in fantasy.","My aim is to change people's perceptions of what a hat can look like in the 21st century."],"Philip Warren Anderson":["I acquired an admiration for Japanese culture, art, and architecture, and learned of the existence of the game of GO, which I still play.","The first months at Harvard were more than challenging, as I came to the realization that the humanities could be genuinely interesting, and, in fact, given the weaknesses of my background, very difficult.","The ability to reduce everything to simple fundamental laws does not imply the ability to start from those laws and reconstruct the universe.","Although raised on the farm - my grandfather was an unsuccessful fundamentalist preacher turned farmer - my father and his brother both became professors.","An important impression was my father's one Sabbatical year, spent in England and Europe in 1937.","The years since the Nobel Prize have been productive ones for me.","The field of quantum valence fluctuations was another older interest which became much more active during this period, partly as a consequence of my own efforts.","The prize seemed to change my professional life very little.","The Nobel Prize gives one the opportunity to take public stands.","I have also testified repeatedly and published some articles in favor of Small Science.","My own work in spin glass and its consequences has formed some of the intellectual basis for these interests.","One of our brainchildren is a still viable Science and Society course."],"Philip Winchester":["I don't think that swearing or gratuitous violence or sex make a show better. I just think there are natural rhythms to a human being in these situations, and what happens in these situations that cable allows is a natural reaction.","I'm a watch guy - to me, they symbolize hard work and determination.","Television is fickle, and it's fleeting.","We're really trying to make movies for TV. Producers and writers are taking risks that they weren't in the past.","I think finales are always so hit or miss because they're so personal. When you do a finale, it's always up to the person watching it.","I really enjoy doing the action stuff, but you have to be careful about who you say yes to with the action stuff 'cause some people want to do it but don't know how, and then it just becomes incredibly frustrating.","I'm doing like a No. 2 or a No. 1 on my head now because I just love how easy it is. I just shave my head and go out.","My British mum met my American dad when she was on holiday in the United States when she was 19. She kinda never looked back. I was born in the United States, raised in Montana and London.","In drama school, I learned I wasn't as good as I thought I was. But I loved stage combat, and I knew that would pay the bills.","I think the first thing I did when I was a kid was a Maxwell House Coffee commercial with George Strait. And I did a Wrangler Jeans commercial, and then 'The Patriot' came to town.","There's such a good vibe in Minneapolis. You've got an upscale downtown, and yet people aren't afraid to sit around the fire pit in the middle of winter and drink a beer. It's amazing."],"Philip Wylie":["One good teacher in a lifetime may sometimes change a delinquent into a solid citizen.","Material blessings, when they pay beyond the category of need, are weirdly fruitful of headache.","Ignorance is not bliss - it is oblivion.","God must hate common people, because he made them so common.","If liberty has any meaning it means freedom to improve."],"Philip Yancey":["Christian faith is... basically about love and being loved and reconciliation. These things are so important, they're foundational and they can transform individuals, families.","Parents learn the uses of power and its limits. They can insist on certain outward behavior but cannot change inner attitudes. They can require obedience but not goodness - and certainly not love.","What I see in the Bible, especially in the book of Psalms, which is a book of gratitude for the created world, is a recognition that all good things on Earth are God's, every good gift is from above. They are good if we recognize where they came from and if we treat them the way the Designer intended them to be treated.","For me, prayer is not so much me setting out a shopping list of requests for God to consider as it is a way of 'keeping company with God.'","It's too bad prayer comes bundled in a package of 'spiritual disciplines.' Really, we should see prayer as a spiritual privilege. We don't do it as a callisthenic exercise to gain points with God; we do it, because it is good for us in every way.","God already knows the naked truth about us, of course. Why not acknowledge it?","God endorses the confusion and even outrage that we feel when mysterious things happen.","When suffering happens, it forces us to confront life in a different way than we normally do.","In China, where you can be arrested and imprisoned for your faith, getting together with other Christians is a lifeline and you'll risk anything for the privilege. No one attends church in China casually, or for a social advantage - quite the opposite.","In some ways, evil is backhanded proof of Gods existence.","One of the greatest things about writing as a profession is that the words of Tolstoy, Chesterton and Dostoyevsky have lived for a hundred years and are just as powerful today. Their words have changed me just as much as the people I actually met.","We're in a celebrity culture, and when I turn on the news today I hear about Lindsay Lohan, Tiger Woods and Paris Hilton and the Kardashian sisters and 'Dancing with the Stars,' one thing after another, Kate Gosselin's new body.","The New Testament persistently presses us upward, toward higher motives for being good.","Muslims have great reverence in their prayers but not much intimacy.","Most of the great books on prayer are written by 'experts' - monks, missionaries, mystics, saints. I've read scores of them, and mainly they make me feel guilty.","When I write, I try to represent the ordinary person in the pew, which means that, ironically, I'm qualified to write about prayer by being unqualified!","The borderlanders are people who are kind of caught in the middle. They think there must be another world out there. There probably is a God, but they are either turned off by the church or wounded by the church or wary of the church for whatever reason.","I think guilt is directional. You should get rid of it, but the way to get rid of it is not to get rid of the guilt feelings. It is to get rid of the wrong that you did that caused the guilt feelings.","I wrote a book on grace, and grace is a free gift, but to receive the gift you have to have your hands open. And a lot of people don't have their hands open, there's something they're grasping because there's a lot of things to grasp in a prosperous country.","You are free to reject God. Make sure that you're really rejecting God, not some caricature of God that the church has shown you. But I, one, respect a God who not only allows us to reject Him but includes the arguments we can use against Him in the Bible. I respect that.","As a nonparent, I stand in awe of parents.","The self-sacrificing, servant aspect of the Christian life has many parallels to parenthood.","Most observers understand the difference between a committed Christian who accepts Jesus as a model for living and a 'cultural Christian' who happens to live in a nation with a Christian heritage. Most Muslims do not.","Much of the misgiving that Muslims feel for the West stems from our strong emphasis on freedom, always a risky enterprise. I've heard some say they would rather rear their children in a closely guarded Islamic society than in the United States, where freedom so often leads to decadence.","People instinctively know the difference between something done with a profit motive and something done with a love motive.","I have come to know a God of compassion and mercy and love.","The world says you gain your life by getting more and more and more and more, but Jesus says, 'No, that leads to death. You get it back by giving it away and when you give it away you get it back.'","People who think they are free eventually end up slaves to their own desires, and those who give their freedom away to the only One you can trust with that freedom eventually get it back."],"Philip Zimbardo":["I'm saying to be a hero is means you step across the line and are willing to make a sacrifice, so heroes always are making a sacrifice. Heroes always take a risk. Heroes always deviant. Heroes always doing something that most people don't and we want to change - I want to democratise heroism to say any of us can be a hero.","The line between good and evil is permeable and almost anyone can be induced to cross it when pressured by situational forces.","That human behavior is more influenced by things outside of us than inside. The 'situation' is the external environment. The inner environment is genes, moral history, religious training.","What happens when good people are put into an evil place? Do they triumph or does the situation dominate their past history and morality?","Human behavior is incredibly pliable, plastic.","A good cult delivers on its promises. A good cult nourishes the needs of its members, has transparency and integrity, and creates provisions for challenging its leadership openly. A good cult expands the freedoms and well-being of its members rather than limits them.","Situational variables can exert powerful influences over human behavior, more so that we recognize or acknowledge.","Many cults start off with high ideals that get corrupted by leaders or their board of advisors who become power-hungry and dominate and control members' lives. No group with high ideals starts off as a 'cult'; they become one when their errant ways are exposed.","Bullies may be the perpetrators of evil, but it is the evil of passivity of all those who know what is happening and never intervene that perpetuates such abuse.","Evil is knowing better, but willingly doing worse.","Most of the evil of the world comes about not out of evil motives, but somebody saying 'get with the program, be a team player;' this is what we saw at Enron, this is what we saw in the Nixon administration with their scandal.","When someone is anonymous, it opens the door to all kinds of antisocial behavior, as seen by the Ku Klux Klan.","What troubles me is the Internet and the electronic technology revolution. Shyness is fueled in part by so many people spending huge amounts of time alone, isolated on e-mail, in chat rooms, which reduces their face-to-face contact with other people.","I have been primarily interested in how and why ordinary people do unusual things, things that seem alien to their natures. Why do good people sometimes act evil? Why do smart people sometimes do dumb or irrational things?","The level of shyness has gone up dramatically in the last decade. I think shyness is an index of social pathology rather than a pathology of the individual.","Ideas for my first experiments in human aggression came from discussions we had in a research seminar about William Golding's 'Lord of the Flies.'","There are times when external circumstances can overwhelm us, and we do things we never thought. If you're not aware that this can happen, you can be seduced by evil. We need inoculations against our own potential for evil. We have to acknowledge it. Then we can change it.","The Stanford prison experiment came out of class exercises in which I encouraged students to understand the dynamics of prison life.","Academic success depends on research and publications.","Heroes are those who can somehow resist the power of the situation and act out of noble motives, or behave in ways that do not demean others when they easily can.","There are no limits to what I would do to make my classes exciting, interesting, unpredictable.","At North Hollywood High School, I was shunned by everyone. I would sit down in the cafeteria, and students would get up from the table and walk away. They thought I was from the Mafia.","Boys are 30 percent more likely than girls to drop out of school. In Canada, five boys drop out for every three girls. Girls outperform boys now at every level, from elementary school to graduate school.","One can't live mindfully without being enmeshed in psychological processes that are around us.","Bullies are often people who are shy and can't make friends easily, so, as the theme of the movie 'A Bronx Tale' tells us, it is better to be feared if you can't be loved.","After doing psychology for half a century, my passion for all of it is greater than ever.","Being hurt personally triggered a curiosity about how such beliefs are formed.","Careers in virtually all academic disciplines are fostered by being a superstar who knows more about one subject than anyone else in the world.","I started studying shyness in adults in 1972. Shyness operates at so many different levels. Out of that research came the Stanford shyness clinic in 1977.","I was discriminated against because I was Jewish, Italian, black and Puerto Rican. But maybe the worst prejudice I experienced was against the poor. I grew up on welfare and often had to move in the middle of the night because we couldn't pay the rent.","My early childhood prepared me to be a social psychologist. I grew up in a South Bronx ghetto in a very poor family. From Sicilian origin, I was the first person in my family to complete high school, let alone go to college.","Prejudice and discrimination have always been a big part of my life. When I was 6, I got beat up and called dirty Jew boy because they thought I looked Jewish.","Time perspective is one of the most powerful influences on all of human behavior. We're trying to show how people become biased to being exclusively past-, present- or future-oriented."],"Philipp Meyer":["When you start to look at Native American history, you realize that, very far from being a peaceful, morally superior people, Native Americans were not that different from Europeans.","You have to believe in yourself and only trust your own vision and instincts. If I'd listened to what other people thought about my work in the first 10 years that I was a writer, I never would have made it to begin with.","Life throws up enough road blocks to keep you from writing; you can't be adding to them yourself by saying you can only write in one specific place. I'm in New York half the time and Texas half the time, and I work wherever - in my computer bag I have some foam ear plugs that I can put in.","When novels deal in abstractions, they generally go off the rails.","I should say that generally I'm a pretty happy person, but as soon as I'm done with a project, I'm usually not happy at all. I feel a little empty and strange. I begin to think about how I can get better, stretch more artistically and intellectually. My biggest worry is getting complacent.","Texas was mostly short-grass and tall-grass prairie when modern Europeans arrived here. It really was a land of milk and honey. But when they brought all these cattle onto these relatively small bits of land, and the cattle were allowed to graze freely, they essentially destroyed the prairie.","You don't make a decision about being a writer. There was a point, aged 21, when it became clear that this is who I am. The choice is how good you are going to be at it and how hard you are going to work.","Since I quit banking, all my major life decisions, when they could, have revolved around writing.","We moved to Baltimore, Maryland, in 1979, when I was five. The funny thing is that, even though Baltimore had one of the top murder rates in the country in those days, I grew up hearing about how dangerous New York was.","I was a bit of a delinquent growing up, a very poor student - I nearly failed several grades before dropping out of high school and getting a G.E.D. But I still read a lot. Thrillers and war novels, mostly, along with the occasional literary novel from my parents' bookshelf.","My first published novel, 'American Rust,' took three and a half years of full-time work to write. But I wrote two apprentice novels before that.","After I finished college, I got a job on Wall Street as a derivatives trader, but after a couple years of it, I was calling in sick in order to work on my novel.","When we think of the myth of the settling of the West, this is our creation myth. But because we think of it as mythology, not as real people interacting with other real people, we ignore the cost of human lives and blood.","There's a reason that all societies and cultures and small bands of humans engage in myth-making. Fundamentally, it is to help us understand ourselves.","I thought that I would have a huge literary novel coming out when I was, like, 29. I quit my banking job, and I was halfway through my second novel - and I will never publish it, because it's very mediocre.","Your mind burns a lot of calories. Writing can feel like a physical workout.","My ideal is to write most of the day, then go running, find friends and socialise all evening; my mind recharges with human contact.","My parents have always been incredibly supportive. Even when I dropped out of high school, they said, 'We trust you, we believe in you.'","I try to begin writing as close to a dreamlike state as I can get.","I didn't know much about Texas when I moved there for graduate school. In my first or second semester, I took a class in life and literature of the Southwest, and that's where I first heard about these events along the border in 1915-1918, what Anglos called the Bandit Wars.","If you're always thinking about someone else's work, about the tradition you're working in, how can you possibly make anything good?","I wanted to think about our creation myth; you know, what is the fundamental story that defines America. And it certainly is the West.","When I dropped out of high school at age 16, I didn't know I was going to become a writer - I just knew I'd never been happy in school, and I had this strong suspicion I'd be happy doing other things.","I don't think you can be taught how to make art. You can be coached, but on a fundamental level you have to figure it out for yourself. You have to learn how your own mind works, figure out your own relationship to the art; you essentially have to invent it completely for yourself.","I'm interested in getting deep into a person's consciousness and doing so in ways in which the narrator is secondary to the character's own thoughts.","When you look at 'Grapes of Wrath,' the weakest moments are those in which Steinbeck is spouting a political idea directly at the reader. The book's real power comes from its slower, broader movement.","Your job as a writer is to find storylines, narrative structures, and characters to show the things that you believe rather than saying them or telling them.","Fundamentally, all art is about human beings. You're always showing larger moral questions through the smaller moral, philosophical, or political choices through one character in the book.","When people grow up in atmospheres of violence or atmospheres of poverty, they don't normally use hi-falutin' language to describe those things. They would describe some brutal event the same way we would describe getting a taxi or missing the bus.","I couldn't understand what was important about school. Dropping out was the first adult decision I made. If I ever have kids, I would hate for them to drop out. But I wasn't a rebel. I never cared to be against school. I just wanted to do what I wanted to do.","I like mechanical things; my first book was a mechanics guide - that was what my parents couldn't pry away from me; that was the blanket.","Cornell changed my life; getting in there was one of my pinnacle moments.","Nothing prepares you for making art except making art. You have to do it to get better.","If you've grown up with guns, the thought that someone might take them away makes your stomach churn. They make you feel safe. If you didn't grow up with guns, if you don't know how to use them, then the thought that someone else has them makes your stomach churn.","I just assume that I'll fail at something for several years - that I'll try my hardest and still fail for several years. With writing, that turned out to be wrong. I tried my hardest and failed for about fifteen years.","Whenever I'm interested in something, I make sure I'm really good at it.","When you take the fact that you're loved for granted, it frees your mind to go after every other thing there is.","When you hold things back, when you don't commit completely to your ideas and trust completely in your own instincts, you are guaranteeing your own failure - even if you end up having commercial success.","When I finish a book, I get extremely restless; I have to aggressively find ways to occupy myself; going off into the woods alone, doing things that are physically or mentally demanding to keep myself busy until the next big idea comes.","Each time a high-wage job is lost, a family is turned upside down. And that affects the communities where they live.","What art and books do at their best is investigate why we are the way we are.","At Cornell University, it was well known that after five years on Wall Street, you could expect to be making half a million a year in salary and bonus; after 10 years, you could expect a million or more. I had 60 grand of university debt, and my parents had no retirement. I needed that money.","I didn't fit the typical profile of a trader. I was an English major working on a novel at night. Most everyone else was a maths or economics major; most everyone else had relatives or family in banking.","I'd grown up in a working class neighborhood in Baltimore, a place hard hit by the offshoring of numerous heavy industries - steel, textile, shipbuilding.","At 16, I dropped out of school and spent five years working as a bicycle mechanic and volunteering in a Trauma Centre before ultimately deciding to go to university."],"Philippa Boyens":["As a screenwriter, you have to let go, and you have to hand your baby over and let it go off into the world, which is entirely appropriate.","It is hard to go back into a world that has already been explored, so to speak. And the fans are very passionate about it, and you don't want to burst that bubble; you don't want to break that illusion. You want to get it right. You want it to feel familiar, but also surprising."],"Philippa Gregory":["The moment that changed me for ever was when I had my first seminar with my history professor at the University of Sussex. I realised that history would answer all the questions I had spent my life asking. It was an extraordinary moment.","If I could change one thing about myself I'd be less highly strung. I find my sensibility quite high maintenance.","Being a stepmother has worked out very well for me. I love my stepchildren very much.","I don't much like Singapore. It's very big, very modern and very urbanised. As a rule, I prefer older places where you get a sense of the history.","When I was a child I wanted to be a vet. I'd come home with \"lost\" kittens and dogs. My mother would tell me to put them back.","I would be very, very uncomfortable at teaching, at dreaming to teach, people things.","I am in the interesting position of being sometimes skimmed by the critics and called literature and sometimes called historical fiction.","I like to do the research of history and the creativity of writing fiction. I am creating this thing which I think is twice as difficult as writing either history or fiction.","I like writing historical fiction.","At the end of the day, I'm writing in a genre that isn't highly regarded.","The house I grew up in was a tall Victorian town house in Bristol. There were very big rooms, which were under-furnished and always cold.","I don't shop as much as a lot of people but I do like designer clothes.","I love going to London for a couple of days but I need to be in the country. I like the silence, the smell and the seasonal changes, especially in spring and summer. I really feel that I belong there.","I try to go to the gym three times a week, and I swim, too.","I would never lie to anyone about history.","I love reading and I love thinking - the reason that I love my books so much is that in order to write them I have to read and to think for years at a time about the same period of time.","Although some people think I am a romantic novelist I have always thought of myself as a rather gritty radical historian.","For instance, I have never believed that there is only one person for each person in the world. It doesn't make the least sense to me. However, in reality, I fell in love at 45 and I am absolutely certain that my now husband is the only man in the world for me, a truth I find both ridiculous and uplifting."],"Philippe Cousteau, Jr.":["Let's face it. Adventure and exploration are in my blood.","Don't eat shrimp - it's one of the most unsustainable fish. For every pound that's caught, 10 or 20 pounds of other stuff is killed and dumped back overboard. It's the number one killer of juvenile sea turtles in Mexico. Two good sustainable seafood guides that I'd recommend are from the Monterey Bay Aquarium and the Blue Ocean Institute.","The world cannot live without the Arctic; it affects every living thing on Earth and acts as a virtual thermostat, reflecting sunlight and cooling the planet.","I hate plastic bottles. Just think about it before you buy one. We pay more for a gallon of water than we do for a gallon of gas. I think people will realize that water quality standards in most municipalities are as good or better for the stuff coming out of the tap than bottled water companies. You'll save money and save the environment, too.","Ocean acidification is often referred to as osteoporosis of the oceans because as acidity rises, shell building creatures such as lobster, oyster, crab, shrimp, and coral are unable to extract the calcium carbonate from the water that they need to build their shells and are thus unable to survive.","As an explorer, I know firsthand there are many places in the ocean so full of life that they should be protected. Coral reefs and mangrove coastlines are stressed already by climate change and ocean acidification, and poor planning will just make their plight worse.","The Arctic is among the least understood places on the planet; however, we do know that its landscape is changing and evolving as quickly as cell phones and the Internet.","The first time I ever had the opportunity to dive on the Great Barrier Reef, it was while filming 'Oceans Deadliest' with Steve Irwin. I remember just how awestruck I was by its beauty.","Since oceans are the life support system of our planet, regulating the climate, providing most of our oxygen and feeding over a billion people, what's bad for oceans is bad for us - very bad.","I love snowboarding. It's probably my favorite sport. I love sitting on top of the mountain and the snow falling and that silence, that snow silence. That's, like, a very peaceful, happy place for me.","Our oceans are facing innumerable threats - from overfishing and pollution to ocean acidification and invasive species - yet we haven't had a blueprint for its use and development, incredible as that seems.","The earliest memories I have of the ocean are actually stories - stories from my grandfather, the legendary ocean explorer and conservationist Jacques Cousteau. My passion for ocean conservation stems from learning at a very young age that we're all connected; we're all in this together.","As our technology evolves, we will have the capacity to reach new, ever-increasing depths. The question is what kind of technology, in the end, do we want to deploy in the far reaches of the ocean? Tools of science, ecology and documentation, or the destructive tools of heavy industry?","My grandfather was Jacques Cousteau, a pioneer of ocean exploration and the co-inventor of scuba diving. Back in the 1940s when he tested out his invention which allowed humans to swim freely in the ocean with a portable air source for the first time in history, very little of the ocean had been explored let alone captured on film.","The EarthEcho World Water Monitoring Challenge is an opportunity for anyone, anywhere to make the first step in taking action for clean water and healthy waterways worldwide.","In many ways, our homes act as one big drain that, through our daily relationship with water, carries many toxic substances into our waterways and the environment.","My greatest hope for a future without another Deepwater Horizon disaster lies in our schools, living rooms and community centers, not in boardrooms, political chambers and big industry. If this happens again, we won't have the luxury of the unknown to shield us from answering 'Why?'","Some parts of our oceans, like the rich and mysterious recesses of our Atlantic submarine canyons and seamounts, are so stunning and sensitive they deserve to be protected from destructive activities.","My grandfather raised me believing in the power of youth to change the world.","Like my father and grandfather, Philippe and Jacques-Yves Cousteau, I've dedicated my life to exploring and protecting our seas, in large part through documentary film.","Truly, we do live on a 'water planet.' For us, water is that critical issue that we need. It's the most precious substance on the planet, and it links us to pretty much every environmental issue, including climate change, that we're facing.","They say that our sense of smell is one of the strongest triggers of memories. Of course, our sense of smell is integral to our sense of taste, so it is no surprise, then, that in a life full of moving and traveling, food has always been a source of familiar comfort for me.","I've been a grant seeker all my life, but when I apply for one and get it, that means someone else doesn't. I didn't want to be a part of that anymore. I wanted to contribute to that pool and make it bigger.","Targeting women is key in developing countries. It allows them to go to school, to say how many children they're going to have, which drives the issue of population and how their children will be educated. Women are the best investments in developing countries.","Phoenix is an interesting example. Drive around and see the golf courses everywhere, and you see people's big green lawns. And you live in a desert! I've always remarked about the capacity of human beings to look at somewhere and move there because of its uniqueness and its beauty and then change it.","I went to elementary school in L.A. I was born in L.A. My mother was from Redondo Beach. My father was French. He died six months before I was born, so my mother went home. I was born there. Not the childhood that most people think. Middle-class, raised by my mother. Single mom.","The fundamental essence of science, which I think we've lost in our education system, is poking something with a stick and seeing what happens. Embrace that process of inquiry.","I could cut my leg of; I could cut my arm off. I could gouge my eye out - I'd still probably survive, but not very well, and that's what we're doing to the ocean. It's the life support system of this planet. We've been dumping in it, we've been polluting it, we've been destroying it for decades, and we're essentially maiming ourselves.","I've been on my grandfather's boat, Calypso, twice in my life. My mother raised me in a pretty typical middle-class life.","Sumatra has these lush forests and huge, amazing creatures like elephants, orangutans, and tigers. They're disappearing because of industry coming in and cutting down the forests.","With EarthEcho Expedition: Acid Apocalypse, we are working with youth leaders and noted experts on the changing chemistry of our ocean to help illuminate one of our most pressing and inscrutable environmental issues.","The fact of the matter is our homes are on the frontlines when it comes to protecting and conserving our critical water resources - more than that, they are also key to protecting our health.","If a product has an endless list of ingredients, and you can't pronounce half of them, I would think twice about bringing them into your home.","If having a beautiful lawn means putting up warning signs several times a year to keep children and pets off of it, it's probably a good idea to look into alternatives.","One of my big pet peeves is single-use plastic bags. I think it's one of the stupidest ideas in the world.","The biggest organ in your body is your skin, and it's a permeable membrane. Anything you put on it goes into you. If you can't pronounce most of the words on the back of the bottle, it's probably not good for you.","Growing up with my father's legacy, we never felt that we had to do anything, but we were always raised to think: What could be better than to explore the wonders of the world and share that with people? To try and make the world a better place. And I guess it stuck.","My father's plan was, we were going to grow up and travel the world.","The goal of each EarthEcho Expedition is to inspire and empower youth around the world with the knowledge and tools to take an active role in protecting critical natural resources in their own communities.","EarthEcho Expeditions represents the culmination of more than a decade of working with educators and youth from around the world. EarthEcho Expeditions uses the thrill of adventure to inspire and empower a new generation of environmental champions.","I travel all over the country speaking to young people, and I am always amazed at how engaged in environmental conservation they are.","Despite their lack of visual impact, headline sex-appeal, and their 'out of sight, out of mind' nature, we should all care about aquatic dead zones because we are all connected to their causes and we all feel their impacts.","Our oceans cover two-thirds of what my grandfather called our water planet, and the part of the ocean that falls under the jurisdiction of the United States covers an area larger than the country itself.","We've built, drilled, and shipped indiscriminately across our oceans, with little consideration for the natural environment that is critical to the health of many of our other ocean uses, like food and recreation.","My grandfather pioneered exploration of what he called 'our water planet,' then my father sought to understand the human connection, and now, as part of the third generation, I'm dedicated to not only raising awareness but also to empowering people to take action.","I have spent many years working in education and media, from hosting documentaries to being a spokesperson for Discovery Education to revolutionizing youth environmental service through my non-profit, EarthEcho International.","Ocean acidification is caused by the ocean absorbing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the same carbon dioxide that is the primary cause of global warming, hence the nickname 'the other carbon problem.' As they do so, the oceans become more acidic with terrible consequences.","Fossil fuels and mining is a short-term gambit. If we develop those resources at the expense of the environmental gold mine that is the Great Barrier Reef, we will all lose in the long run.","Helping people understand the impact of key environmental and human issues worldwide is something that I'm passionate about. CNN's 'Going Green' series of specials are engaging viewers around the world through important messages of conservation and hope.","When you talk to a Republican, many of them just outright say, 'Yeah. Climate change isn't real,' without assessing the facts, and it's a big problem. It's not a red or blue issue, it's a green issue... Not because of facts or science but because of emotion.","We've explored very little of the ocean. We really don't know what's out there. But people think we've figured it all out.","Both EarthEcho and Seventh Generation understand that young people have the power to change the world - one home, one school and one community at a time.","There's this terrific kid in Maine who saw all the waste generated by straws handed out in restaurants. So he made up these little pop-up cards and asked restaurant owners put them on the tables to explain why straws wouldn't be handed out unless requested. Of course, the restaurant owners couldn't resist a 9-year-old kid, and so it worked.","Science is cool! But it's easy for that to get lost in textbooks sometimes."],"Philippe Dauman":["I like to have fulsome discussions on every topic. What happens if you lose this show? What would you do? We have to look at every hypothesis.","I go to third grade, and I'm scared to death. I'm just 6 years old, and the kids are so much bigger than me."],"Philippe Falardeau":["If you're writing a screenplay from scratch, it involves a lot of creation.","In the province of Quebec where I come from, we speak French, and the only cosmopolitan city is Montreal. Every time we tackle the subject of immigration and racial tension, it's an issue that concerns Montreal.","I work, play and do everything in French.","I think cinema is the memory and the imagination of the country. Take the memory and imagination out of an individual, and he stops being an individual. I think it's the same thing for a country.","In Canada, we have so much land, so much space, and so few people.","I studied political science and international relations and had the intention of becoming a journalist or work in foreign affairs. I had no intention of making a film.","The first person to make me realize there was someone behind the film was Steven Spielberg.","In Quebec, we're less inhibited artistically, culturally, politically. We're less focused on box office and comparing our films to the American films.","When you're younger, and you do your first or second film, you want to show everyone what you can do.","I would love to write a script where the main character is a woman. I know I can direct a film where the main character is a woman. I cannot write that film.","I'm not too keen on jokes that are one-liners. I want the situation to be funny.","Once you're on the set and shooting, it's all just cinema. You have actors and cameras.","When I'm actually making a film and trying to find solutions, I like to watch making-of documentaries about huge films, like 'Gladiator.' That couldn't be more apart from what I'm doing, but you see Ridley Scott facing huge problems and fixing them.","I studied political science and international relations, so I never considered myself an artist."],"Philippe Halsman":["A true portrait should, today and a hundred years from today, the Testimony of how this person looked and what kind of human being he was.","Of the thousands of people, celebrated and unknown, who have sat before my camera, I am often asked who was the most difficult subject, or the easiest, or which picture is my favorite. This last question is like asking a mother which child she likes the most."],"Philippe Perrin":["It's only when you're flying above it that you realize how incredible the Earth really is.","I think doing something of your life is something that you've got deep inside, whether it's to, whether you want to be an astronaut or a, whether you want to do science, or whether you want to be a movie star, or whatever.","The student develops an analytical as well as finely blended character. He is able to choose from a wide variety of job fields from which to embrace a career, without having to be a specialist in one particular discipline.","Yes, I see the Mobile Base System really is the shoulder of the arm. The arm is right there, like a human arm. It's really funny to look at the similarities between a human arm and the Canadian robotics arm.","We also had to bring with us some desired scientific equipment over to the station as well as assemble new machines. For that, I had to conduct two space walks.","This mission was the project of a decade's work.","The last thing, and the only one that you cannot physically train for, is the psychological preparation.","So, it takes a lot of chance and luck. I mean I was lucky enough to get in the program where people with the same skills never made it to the program. So keep trying.","So, for me, I make no difference whether I'm training with my shuttle crew or the Expedition crew. Of course, I think I want to take more care of the Expedition crew, because they're going to stay there for a long time.","So it's, I think it's quite, quite unique to fly with somebody with so much experience.","Since there always has to be a certain number of astronauts manning the station at all times, one of the main aspects of the mission was to transport a new team to the station and bring back some members of the previous team back to Earth.","Shortly afterwards, I did a third one to repair the robotic arm of the station. This arm plays a very important role in the ongoing expansion of the station as well as in the deployment of solar panels.","Polytechnique is a school whose multidisciplinary, very high scientific level curriculum is invaluable.","It's, I mean, for me, it's the same as training with my crewmembers. We share the same first part of the flight. We all go together. It's the most critical part of the flight, the ascent.","I've been as a pilot involved in the Gulf War. And then, in the No-Fly Zone.","I think that witnessing ecological problems visible from space is one of the new and essential roles of astronauts.","I had been here five years already, training very hard, learning about the systems, the shuttle, the station systems. But, everything really became real when I started to work with them.","Especially when I first really started to work with Kenneth and Franklin, who had been in space already. And so, they were able to talk about space and tell me a few things about how things would really happen.","And, you run also video because to fly this arm, you're relying mostly on some external camera views that may be coming from the arm itself or from the station.","And, I think, as a kid, I had a strong motivation to do something of my life. And, I think that's the strongest motivation I really got. And, that came obviously from my parents and my grandparents.","And everything stopped quite rapidly because I knew that nobody in Europe was able to go to space. It was the privilege of being either American or Russian."],"Philippe Petit":["I was never part of the sailing circle, but I enjoy when I'm invited to sail.","My time is always divided when I prepare for a wire walk. First I dream, technically and artistically, and then I go to work, and I am the master rigger, climbing trees and ladders and constructing. Only then I change my cap and become the performer.","It is treacherous on a high wire to change your focus point and suddenly look down.","My journey has always been the balance between chaos and order.","Passion is the motto of all my actions.","I focus, I invent, I transform, I challenge, I attempt, I observe, I perform.","I have a fear of water, believe it or not. To put a wire 12 feet over a swimming pool frightens me. I don't like water.","I, like everybody else, have a certain fear of heights, and I have to be very careful when I am in the clouds, but it is also what I love; it is my domain, so when you love something, you don't have fear.","I started putting a wire up in secret and performing without permission. Notre Dame, the Sydney Harbor Bridge, the World Trade Center. And I developed a certitude, a faith that convinced me that I will get safely to the other side. If not, I will never do that first step.","The impossible - we are told - cannot be achieved. To overcome the 'impossible,' we need to use our wits and be fearless. We need to break the rules and to circumvent - some would one say to cheat.","If I see three oranges, I have to juggle. And if I see two towers, I have to walk.","Usually, when I walk on a wire, I inspect the anchor point on both sides before crossing.","If I am practicing on the wire, and you pushed me, I would not move, and if you take a piece of wood and beat me up on the shoulder and the head, I would not move. You would not put me out of balance. You would not be able to. I am solid as granite when I am on the tight rope, and I should be.","I am the poet of the high wire - I never do stunts; I do theatrical performances.","Certainly, in the story of my life, the walk between the Twin Towers was one of the grandest, one of the most memorable, but not solely the grandest and the most memorable.","I found out that total creativity involves a certain intellectual rebellion - not to become a criminal, but somehow. to be totally creating, you have to do things that are a little bit forbidden. You have to feel free, and we know freedom is a hard thing to get.","You see, it's actually very good that a human activity is performed very close to death, because that's where life is. Life is, at its most valuable and most full, very close to the boundary of life.","When I was six years old, I fell in love with magic. For Christmas, I got a magic box and a very old book on card manipulation. Somehow, I was more interested in pure manipulation than in all the silly little tricks in the box.","When you are a young person, the world is yours. You can do the impossible.","I have been performing in the street for more than 50 years: magic for basically 60 years, and the high wire 45 years. The beauty of it is that it's never the same. It's never easy. And yet, part of my art is to make it look easy.","Many people use the words 'death defying' or 'death wishing' when they talk about wire-walking. Many people have asked me: 'So do you have a death wish?' After doing a beautiful walk, I feel like punching them in the nose. It's indecent. I have a life wish.","If I had been born in the circus, my parents would have pushed me on that little high wire at four years old. That's when the body is most limber to learn those acrobatics.","On a very long and very high wire, I will not hope to not be blown off by high winds. I will have the certitude that such could not happen.","I love to remember the World Trade Centre walk, but it should not define me.","I love or hate things straight away. I like to go directly to action to see the result. I think I must be difficult, but at the same time, it's not for me to say.","I hate all electronic things that are supposed to help the human being. You don't smell, you don't hear, you don't touch anymore.","On one day of the week, I relax - which is not true, I work furiously on other things. 'Relax' is not a word to me.","How could I share with you how I felt when two towers that I loved, two pieces of steel and glass and concrete fell down, when actually they took with them thousands of human lives? That is the actual tragedy. But those towers were almost human for me. I was in love with them, and that's why I married them with a tight rope.","For me, since I have a life wish, not a death wish, for me, I was not gambling my life. I was doing something much more beautiful. I was carrying my life across.","I will never fall prey to celebrity because I am too busy. I have other things to do than look at myself in the mirror.","If you see how carefully I prepare for any kind of walk, legal or illegal, small or big, you will see that, actually, I narrow the unknown to virtually nothing. And that's when I am ready to walk on the wire.","Of course, the slightest little mistake on the wire will deprive me of my life, so in that sense, yes, it is a dangerous profession. You have to pay attention; if not, you will lose your life.","This moment where we think we rest, when the brain is floating, you know, in sleep, is actually a moment where I could be very creative in a very strange, uncontrolled way.","Death frames the high wire. But I don't see myself as taking risks. I do all of the preparations that a non-death seeker would do.","Faith is what replaces doubt in my dictionary.","When a loved one disappears, you continue to live with the accompaniment of that person. One has to find a balance between joy and sorrow.","There is a child inside me that wants to come out and do something to surprise all the adults.","The wire is a safe place for me to be. The street is not. Life is not. It's a rigorous and simple path. It's straight. You don't have meanders like, you know, on the ground, in life.","To be able to create fully, it's maybe fine that you learn the rules, but you have to forget and to rebel against those rules.","Right after my Twin Towers walk, I was approached by hundreds of people, and I said no to all the offers. I could have become a millionaire overnight, obviously, but I said no, and I continue to be uninterested.","I would not describe my personality. And I think when you describe people, you are making a mistake. That's not how they are; that's how you perceive them at that moment. It's limiting in front of something that is magnificent and unlimited: life.","If I have to make a self-portrait, I would put poetry and rebellion on the list. To be able to walk on a wire, to be able to juggle six hoops, you need focus, another word for tenacity, which is passion.","It would be very, very dangerous for a wire walker to experience fear while he is balancing on the wire. Fear has its place on earth, before and maybe after a high-wire walk, but not during for me.","I am not up there by chance. I am there by choice. And I know the wire. And I know my limits. And I am a madman of details.","I am a thief of knowledge, and in a survival way, I had to solve all the problems around me.","An intellectual challenge presents itself? I am in bliss. Instantly, it brings forth the notion of triumph.","There was a time when fire and story would fall asleep in unison. It was dream time.","As I'm studying magic, juggling is mentioned repeatedly as a great way to acquire dexterity and coordination. Now, I had long admired how fast and fluidly jugglers make objects fly. So that's it. I'm 14; I'm becoming a juggler.","On the high wire, within months, I'm able to master all the tricks they do in the circus, except I am not satisfied.","It's very easy to walk on a wire if you spend a whole lifetime practicing for it.","If a leaf fell from a tree, I'd stop juggling and play with the leaf. I went to my prop bag and got a little bandage and stuck the leaf back on the tree. People loved it.","Truly, from a very early age, I started distancing myself from other kids, not out of willingness, but just out of the nature of my energy. I liked to do things solely, and I already had a taste of the quest for perfection, which is unusual in a little kid.","My parents were intelligent and encouraging, but at the same time, they were displeased at me becoming a wandering troubadour and wire walker.","I was in art school once a week from six to 16, which was essential in shaping my artistic sensitivity.","I keep saying I am an auto-didact, but I have a lot of outside influences. One I could cite is juggler Francis Brunn, who was the first man to throw ten rings in the air; he was really an amazing juggler who showed onstage the quest for perfection.","I have been expelled from five different schools when I was a kid. And I learned basically all what I do by myself.","I started very early, from five or six years old, to climb. To climb trees, to climb rocks everywhere I could. At some point, of course, I used a rope.","I started making monkey bridges, like kids do, and climbing and rappelling with ropes. Very naturally, I needed some knots. At the very beginning, I didn't care, I didn't know, and then slowly I started to know, and I started to care. I wanted to know more knots or the right knot for the special action.","I needed more knowledge in rigging and knotting. I started collecting books on knots and really learning more and more. That's how it started. And also in magic, of course. With a piece of rope, you can do magic.","Everybody wanted me to be rich and famous on my art. And I said no to all the commercials and all the seedy offers.","I did a walk in 1973 illegally in the northern side of the Sydney Harbor Bridge.","Every year, I am conscious of the anniversary of my 1974 World Trade Center walk.","It's very normal - when you're not used to the world of the high wire, it's very normal to be simply terrified. The reason I'm not is because I've done it for so many years.","I've been arrested many times for illegal high wire walking and illegal street performing.","What I think tailors the creativity of most people are the rules that we learn from the age we are very small - in school, our parents.","I was thrown out of different schools because I was practicing my arts - magic, juggling, and the high wire.","I am fascinated by the engineering. The science of constructing and understanding why it stands. And I am drawn by the madness, the beauty, the theatricality, the poetry and soul of the wire. And you cannot be a wire-walker without mingling those two ways of seeing life.","It's part of my life to feel like a criminal, to have eyes in my back and see if I'm being followed. It's a feeling that comes from street juggling because I have been arrested so many times.","Art is maybe a subversive activity. There is a certain rebellion when you are an artist at heart, even if only in the art of living.","For years, I have been working on crossing the Grand Canyon. Actually, there is nobody who says 'no,' but since this is a project that comes from me and not a commission, I have to find the money, plan the logistics, etcetera.","I was born in a world of opera, theatre, films, poetry, art, and therefore, out of the wire, I made a stage. That's why they call me a high wire artist.","Notre Dame and Sydney - that was nothing. Notre Dame doesn't have a police station; it is not 1,000 or so feet high. It was a public structure, very easy to access. And Sydney Harbour Bridge was half-and-half: a bridge, in the middle of the night. The World Trade Center was the end of the world. Electronic devices, police dogs.","I am a wire-walker. I can walk any time, anywhere - I'm indestructible.","I rendezvous with the long wire and perform the 'torero walk', gliding my feet, holding the pole away from my body, head high.","Wire-walking in performance is one thing - I never fell, of course. If I had, I wouldn't be here talking about it.","In my life, I wanted to meet certain people. I never met Charlie Chaplin, but I met Werner Herzog.","Obsessed people are not humorless at all.","When art in general, and film in particular, succeeds is when it pulls you away onto a voyage. Then it's a good film."],"Phillip Adams":["Unless you're willing to have a go, fail miserably, and have another go, success won't happen.","The Internet provides a delivery system for pathological states of mind.","Advertising men and politicians are dangerous if they are separated. Together they are diabolical.","It's a privilege to present 'Late Night Live'. No radio program, anywhere on Earth, casts a wider net."],"Phillip E. Johnson":["Modernism is typically defined as the condition that begins when people realize God is truly dead, and we are therefore on our own.","The assumption that nature is all there is, and that nature has been governed by the same rules at all times and places, makes it possible for natural science to be confident that it can explain such things as how life began.","Although I insist that God has always had the power to intervene directly in nature to create new forms, I am willing to be per-suaded that He chose not to do so and instead employed secondary natural causes like random mutation and natural selection.","Truth as such is not a particularly important concept in naturalistic philosophy.","The second advantage claimed for naturalism is that it is equivalent to rationality, because it assumes a model of reality in which all events are in principle accessible to scientific investigation.","A constitutional democracy is in serious trouble if its citizenry does not have a certain degree of education and civic virtue.","To philosophical materialists God is no more than an idea in the human mind, and not a very important idea.","In short, it is not that evolutionary naturalists have been less brazen than the scientific creationists in holding science hostage, but rather that they have been infinitely more effective in getting away with it.","Evolutionary naturalism takes the inherent limitations of science and turns them into a devastating philosophical weapon: because science is our only real way of knowing anything, what science cannot know cannot be real.","The problem with allowing God a role in the history of life is not that science would cease, but rather that scientists would have to acknowledge the existence of something important which is outside the boundaries of natural science.","All the most prominent Darwinists proclaim naturalistic philosophy when they think it safe to do so.","So one reason the science educators panic at the first sign of public rebellion is that they fear exposure of the implicit religious content in what they are teaching.","In the most important sense a creationist is a person who believes in creation, and that includes people who believe that Genesis is a myth and that creation involved a process called evolution and consumed billions of years.","As a theist I believe that God exists and that God creates.","Most importantly, I agree that the truth of these matters should be determined by interpretation of scientific evidence - experiments, fossil studies and the like.","Some theists in evolutionary science acquiesce to these tacit rules and retain a personal faith while accepting a thoroughly naturalistic picture of physical reality.","Darwinism is not merely a support for naturalistic philosophy: it is a product of naturalistic philosophy.","No doubt it is true that science cannot study God, but it hardly follows that God had to keep a safe distance from everything that scientists want to study.","According to the scientific naturalist version of cosmic history, nature is a permanently closed system of material effects that can never be influenced by something from outside - like God, for example.","The restriction of religion to private life therefore does not necessarily threaten the vital interests of the majority religion, if there is one, and it protects minority religions from tyranny of the majority.","If modernist naturalism were true, there would be no objective truth outside of science. In that case right and wrong would be a matter of cultural preference, or political power, and the power already available to modernists ideologies would be overwhelming.","First, Darwinian theory tells us how a certain amount of diversity in life forms can develop once we have various types of complex living organisms already in existence.","Evolutionary biologists are not content merely to explain how variation occurs within limits, however. They aspire to answer a much broader question-which is how complex organisms like birds, and flowers, and human beings came into existence in the first place.","In short, the proposition that God was in any way involved in our creation is effectively outlawed, and implicitly negated.","The monopoly of science in the realm of knowledge explains why evolutionary biologists do not find it meaningful to address the question whether the Darwinian theory is true."],"Phillip Lim":["You can make jeans and a t-shirt super stylish. It's what you make of it, you know?","You know, for myself, my personal journey has been a very fortunate one and I would say to people it's like the stars lined up and the skies opened up and the sun shined and I met the right people - was at the right time. And, most importantly, you know I love what I do.","I don't have a life where it's galas, posh affairs. It's me, my dog and a sofa. And a TV.","My mother has become my daughter and I've become her guardian.","Being from a very traditional Chinese-American family, my parents believed the only options to have a successful life were to be a doctor, a lawyer, an engineer or a business person.","I have always had a relationship with clothes.","When I say that I'm a businessperson and a dressmaker, it's the truth. I run a business, and I make dresses, I make blouses.","I'm really a classicist at heart - with a bit of madness!","There is a secret hippie within me.","I'm not such a public person.","I'm shy.","When people ask about inspirations, and you're like 'oh, it was a flower or a mountain or a pony', some people just think you're insane. I'm worried to come across that way.","I'm such a technophobe.","I think my parents were immigrants, you know, so I guess I would be first generation. Growing up in California.","I love crazy, gaudy bling.","My mother was a seamstress, so making clothes was not something you would willingly go into.","I started in college as a business major and finally transferred to home economics and studied making clothes.","I try to always have flowers in the house. I have a florist in Chinatown, and they deliver orchids every two weeks. I like living with living things.","Just because you work in the fashion industry, it doesn't mean you live your life in fashion."],"Phillip Noyce":["Making movies is eating candy. It's a very expensive candy, so you value when you can do it. So when you can do it twice at once, it's like, you know, a kid in a candy store!","Whites were the winners, blacks were the losers, we wrote the history books, and they didn't feature.","You always try to work for your audience, to entertain them, but that being said, obviously, within the studio system you feel the sense of responsibility to the bank.","Well, I don't know what they'll turn out to be, but I'm working on a film of Kon Tiki.","There were a couple Aborigines in my primary school, but we never spoke to them. They kept to themselves, and we never really even locked eyes. They weren't acknowledged officially either.","The more she rejected us the more convinced I was that she was another version of the real Molly, her disdain for authority, her scepticism that she had to do what the white man told her because it was good for her... She is Molly.","The children, each of those kids is in touch with nature and traditional aboriginal culture so a very important part of getting performances from them was just letting them be and trying to capture the unique spirituality that was in each of them.","So when I read this story, it unlocked a volcano of unanswered questions, because the questions had never been asked. It was an opportunity to come to terms with the lot of repressed history - and history of repression.","People just don't laugh when their family is violated, and you don't shrug it off. You band together and you defend together. It's a funny, primitive instinct.","Oh yeah - I watched Knife in the Water, saw the shot, and repeated it. But even if I hadn't seen that film, inevitably the camera would've ended up on top of that mast, I mean if you think of it there are only so many dynamic shots on a boat.","Obviously all of us have thought about Vietnam, particularly in my generation in Australia that were part of conscription and fought there. Our friends came back, forever changed. So there were a lot of questions.","Most Australians live in the cities on the east coast, where contact between black and white occurred as much as 200 years earlier than on the west coast - and where 95 percent of Australians are able to live 95 percent of their lives without ever seeing an Aboriginal face.","I remembered the 500 people that lived on a reserve outside my little town, behind a big fence.","I no longer knew what it was like to feel Australian.","After working for years in Hollywood where the actors have taken over, it was a real relief to get down there and not only have some children, but also have some actors that had no attitude.","A collection of huts surrounded by a barbed wire fence, and in the huts lived 500 of the original inhabitants of our area. And so it went with many country towns around Australia."],"Phillip Phillips":["I love chicken and anything to do with chicken. I love anything that's homemade. Oh, and BBQ. And I love green beans. There is so much good food. I can go on and on and on.","I'm a guitar player first. So my first hero was Angus Young from AC/DC. I used to copy every move that he did, play every lick that he would. I knew I wanted to be some kind of a rocker, back in the day.","I get scared as crap to perform but I push myself to do it. I don't know what I would be doing without it.","Some songs are just going to be acoustic with just maybe some light background stuff going on and maybe violin or something like that. Or sax - I mean, I'm definitely having some sax. That's just what I love. It's going to be jazz-rock stuff. That's what I'm aiming for.","Live shows are really big for me. I want to do as many of those as I can.","I have two belly buttons.","Cooking, to me, it's kind of therapeutic. It's completely different from music as well. I'm not amazing at it, but I can cook myself a good meal. And I'm not just saying this, but anytime I'm on the bus or at home, I'm watching Food Network or cooking on TV just 'cause it's interesting to me.","I have no idea why I won, man. I guess some people liked the music that I was doing. I'm just lucky. I was just doing my thing each week.","I didn't even want to sing, honestly. I started thinking about how long the journey was, how far all of us had come - me and Jessica Sanchez, Hollie Cavanagh and Josh Ledet and everybody. It's insane, man. It's not as easy as you think.","It started last year, during the summer. I went to the doctor and they found out it was kidney stones, so they had surgery done to help get those out and to pass them... More just kept coming in. So I had all together before the last show... I had like five surgeries.","A couple days ago, I saw a lot of people tweeting, 'Oh, it's so cool 'Home' is being used in the Olympics!' We don't really get to watch much TV, man, with the concerts every night, but I wish I could have seen it. I really just found out through Twitter and my management texting me. I thought it was really awesome.","I've just been recording mostly acoustic stuff, drums, and sax, and electric guitar. I'm just still writing songs and what not.","I know what my sound is. I'm just trying to get it out there how I can explain it. I'm not trying to write or put out some music that doesn't represent me.","I'd rather sell 10,000 records that represent me than 2 million that don't represent me at all.","I am very grateful for the opportunities provided to me through appearing on 'American Idol.' The value that the fans and the show have given to my career is not lost on me. However, I have not felt that I have been free to conduct my career in a way that I am comfortable with.","I get scared to death every time I have to play. I always get nervous because you never know what to expect. The crowd could be awful, or it could be amazing. You just never know what you're going to get until you get out there and do it. I just do my best and have fun.","I'm nervous, but once I get a guitar on and start a song, after the first few seconds, I can feel it ease. I don't have to worry about anything other than the music.","'Idol' was a great experience. It was a great stepping-stone. I got to meet a lot of amazing people through that and learn a lot of great things. But afterward - that's what I tell a lot of people - it's up to you to represent it as an artist.","Not many artists or bands go platinum every year, from what people have told me, so it's an honor to have so many fans. A million people, that's a lot of people! Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, and Justin Timberlake sell a few million, and so hopefully I'll make my way up to that.","I'm not big on dark chocolate, but I do have a sweet tooth, so it gets me in trouble. I love warm chocolate chip cookies with ice cream. Then there's this chocolate pie my mom makes for me every year for my birthday. She's been making it since I was younger, and there's nothing like it. It's really so, so good!","My sister has a non-profit organization called Mission Change. It helps the homeless and kids.","I'm from South Georgia, so my mom, she always cooked some dang good food when I was growing up.","When people write things on the Internet about me that aren't true, it's tough to deal with. Even if you're the most mellow person in the world, stuff like that bothers you eventually.","I'm into zombie movies like 'World War Z' and the shows 'Breaking Bad' and 'The Walking Dead.'","I've written with people who aren't like me, then I've written with people who totally get it. It's like a blind date, and you never know what's going to happen. But it's really cool because they learn from you, and you learn a little bit from them. And sometimes it works out, and sometimes it doesn't.","I'm not some cute guy who is trying to be successful off that. I really want the music to come first.","In my opinion, it seems like music is taking a bit of a turn. Look at Mumford and Sons, and the Lumineers. It seems like people and music fans are enjoying the more artistic side of music, and that popular music is taking a turn and accepting that, so I appreciate that.","I'm always writing. It might be a bad song, but I'm always writing.","I never thought I'd be traveling the world supporting my music. Everybody seems to really enjoy the music because it comes from me, and I'm proud of it.","'American Idol' was just really a platform. What you do after that is what separates you from the show. And I've been working really hard, touring constantly, and building those fans. You've got to work hard.","I hate performing on live television. It's so scary, because, if you screw up, you don't really get any retakes. So when I do television shows now, having been on 'Idol' really helps me mentally to just kind of take it all in. So I learned a lot from it.","It's different every time you write. Sometimes it might be harder than it was the day before. I don't like forcing it, but sometimes, if you force it a little bit, it helps you to push forward, and you get inspired in a way. I've written songs in an hour. And there are songs that have taken me six months."],"Phillip Sweet":["Stay true to yourself, yet always be open to learn. Work hard, and never give up on your dreams, even when nobody else believes they can come true but you. These are not cliches but real tools you need no matter what you do in life to stay focused on your path.","It's really interesting how music can knock down a wall and be an open connection between you and someone else where something else can't. When music comes along, it just opens your heart a little more."],"Phillipa Soo":["There's no map for you to follow and take your journey. You are Lewis and Clark. You are the mapmaker.","I've prioritized taking care of my mind, having fun, and doing things that make me laugh. And eating well - as in, really good food, like steak or pasta or fresh vegetables or an amazing dessert. You know, 'treat yo'self.'","I love the collaborative process. Getting to meet new people and really building something with them is such a wonderful way to get to know someone.","I've been very lucky. I made a choice, getting out of school, to follow the work and the people that really struck my heartstrings; 'Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812' was one of those - maybe it was an accident.","I feel like 'Amelie' is very much an extension of me. She's a contemporary woman who sees the world through her imagination.","When I go into a theater, I'm very excited to turn off my phone. But then, of course, I get anxiety.","I think I'm obsessed with food. Maybe that's why I'm making the transition to organic products - they just feel yummy. I like vanilla scents. I like mint. I like sage. I like the idea of smelling blackberries every time I blink. It's so good.","There's a very old tradition of theater actors doing their own makeup. It's like putting on your mask. There's an element of storytelling involved in it - you put on your character when you put on your makeup. At least, that's how I like to look at it.","I feel more like an American citizen now than I ever had, and it's artistically fulfilling.","Exposing yourself to many kinds of art can only lead to amazing things. It helps you learn about your own art, your own taste, what kind of art you want to create for yourself.","I think in general, people are baffled by love and what it does to them and how far they'll go to have love and be loved.","I think it's just amazing to be in a group of women, in a group of people that you can spend enough time with them to really get to know people and be inspired by them and learn something new about them every day.","I find it's nice when I can be a listener and absorb things coming at me. It's important, especially for me, when so much of my job is about putting things out into the world. So those quiet moments are rejuvenating.","I will say, I can definitely throw down a sick beat once in a while and provide an amazing backup track for somebody who can really, actually freestyle.","I learn something new about love every day. For example, loving yourself is just as important as loving other people.","During the winter of 2013, we were running 'Comet' up in midtown - as opposed to downtown - and across the street in the Standard, and that was, like, our third time going at it, from Ars Nova to downtown to near Broadway. We weren't on Broadway. We were near Broadway, as we said.","I'm half-Chinese and half-Caucasian. My grandparents came here from China. My father was born in New Jersey.","Beyond just the respect that you want to have, people just miss out on being in the moment when they have a screen in front of their face. I just don't know to tell people. I feel it's like, you know, 'Turn off your phone and go to the theater.'","I took dance from a very early age, although my first recital, I remember refusing to go onstage. I think I was three. It's funny because that stage was also my high school theater stage.","My mother took my brother and I to a production of 'The Tempest', and it was in this very small - it could have been the basement of a church or a black box. The space was vast, but there were maybe 15 seats in the middle. Ariel came out wearing a nude sparkly thong and spike heels, and the muses had these gossamer see-through gowns on.","We did a student-initiated project of 'A Little Night Music', which was the first time that all of the divisions - music, dance, drama, opera - came together and put on a piece. It was a black box kind of feel. We had to get costumes that were pieced together. We had our own lighting that we finagled.","There's the cool factor, right? You see your face on a sign or your name on something, like, 'Ahh! Here I am!' And then there's a huge responsibility and the scary part of it, which is like, 'Now what happens?' And then you realize, 'Oh, yeah, this is my job.'","On long car rides, we would always listen to the 'Blues Brothers' soundtrack and try to emulate everything that Aretha Franklin was doing. There was soul and grit in it that I think a kid from the suburbs really needed.","Doing a show eight times a week is kind of like doing yoga or tai chi. A vinyasa is the same every single time you do it, but depending on how you're feeling, it tells you a lot about what's happening in your life.","Everyone has a different interpretation of characters we know and love from Shakespeare, from 'Miller'. There's specific things about them that are written that are kind of the fingerprints of the first person who played that role, and so I like to think of it as a road map.","There's a huge shift in the way we connect with people as humans in the technology age versus right before that, when we still had a little bit of mystery.","Doing something out of town is so beautiful because it really becomes about the process, and the product will be a result of it, but process is what is the goal - to really see what works and create the best story possible.","It doesn't matter where you are: theater brings people together.","'Hamilton' is, of course, closely tied to the Obamas because Lin first performed the opening number at a White House poetry jam.","I didn't know anything about Eliza when I first got the call about 'Hamilton.' Tommy Kail, the director, asked me if I wanted to be a part of it. I knew what he was talking about because I'd seen the video of Lin performing it at the White House for Barack and Michelle Obama.","My grandmother was a classical pianist, so I grew up with Schubert, Mozart, Beethoven. I studied piano as a kid. My musical background and upbringing was very much a mix.","Right out of school, I did this show called 'Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812.' It is based on a classical text with new music - not necessarily confined by a certain genre. It was a diverse, interesting group of musicians, actors, nonactors, and singers all creating this thing that is bigger than all of us.","Now, when building a show, I ask myself the question - like, 'Jumping off this table will be really cool, but can I do that eight times a week?'.","I think I've learned, really, just how to let go - if an idea doesn't work, or it's not perfect, that's O.K.","I'm definitely not as good as people who consider themselves beatboxers.","That's kind of just the nature of our business, is that you're really putting a lot of energy and time and care into something that isn't necessarily going to last forever.","It's the coolest job to be on Broadway.","I read 'Backstage' a lot when I first was unleashed into the world from drama school. And what was great about it was that if I was using it or not, it was just nice to know what was happening in my community.","You can't avoid the conversation of diversity and remembering that diversity goes beyond race and culture. It goes into gender and sexual orientation and all sorts of things.","I really love being in a room and developing work.: being at the table, looking at the script for the first time, and putting a story on its feet.","We try to find the information, the clues, to unlock the play or the story or our characters, especially when they're based on real people that live and breathe.","The way theater can bring people together is so powerful.","It wasn't until 'Hamilton' that I began to be considered an actor of color, and I really don't know what to make of it.","The only musicals I've really worked on in New York are new musicals, and I like the idea that my job as an actor is also that of a detective, archaeologist, and mystery solver.","I'm trying to look into each character and try to realize her as someone who is also me.","I definitely have been approached and reached out to by a lot of young Asian American and Asian women, which has been really cool for me.","I actually grew up seeing a lot of classical theater - a lot of Shakespeare - but I have such a passion for music and find that way of telling a story to be really compelling as well.","You get to crack the code of the play. You get to really pick at it and see, 'What is the story that we're telling?' 'What are the clues in the text that I can find that will help inform what story we're telling?' It's almost like a detective mystery.","All I wanted to do was create theater for us, for our generation, for the people of this planet. And it's so rare that the art that you are making is reaching a huge mass of people.","I wake up around nine, drink a cup of coffee, answer some emails, and ease myself into the day.","I eat a light but sustaining dinner before the show: a bunch of greens and some non-gluten quinoa or rice. I'll have a snack at intermission. I'm trying so hard not to have meals after the show because it's so late, but sometimes I just want a big bowl of pasta.","When you're on a show schedule, everything is heightened. You're always aware of what works and what doesn't so you can be at your best.","At night, I'll do coconut oil or almond oil on my face as a mask to replenish my skin. I've found those are so simple but work better than any other product. Coconut oil is so good, but if you don't want to smell like a cookie, sweet almond oil isn't as pungent.","My mom always told me to follow my bliss. And I remember specifically with my father, when I was out of school and not knowing how I'd get a job or make money - should I take some classes? What do I do? He said as long as I was working - to enrich myself in some way - that I was on the right path.","I think as a young person, leaving high school or college, you're like, 'All right, all right, enough already.' But now there's a part of me that would like to go back and relish those moments when you could sit down and just... read a book.","I went through a phase when I was watching a lot of foreign films, just itching to get out of the suburbs and explore.","As a woman, it's nice to hear people at the stage door say, 'I didn't even know! She's a woman, and that's the most amazing thing'.","I relate to that idea of not necessarily seeking out 'interesting female roles,' but 'this character, this role, who happens to be a woman, is interesting to me, and I relate to it in some way, so I'm just gonna go with my gut and see where it leads me.'","In terms of my own experience, my dad is first-generation, so his parents were from China, and my mom was born and raised in southern Illinois, and she was involved in the arts. My dad's a doctor.","'Hamilton' just asks us all to go a little bit deeper: whether you're a hip-hop fan seeing musical theater for the first time, or if you were thinking you were gonna see some reprise of 1776, and now it's this? And you're thinking, 'Wait a minute, these people aren't white!' It asks you just take a step and go a little deeper.","There is a certain vulnerability to creating art and putting it out in the world for the first time, but again, there's a kind of thrill to that as well.","You are carving out a story. You and your colleagues are trying to make something that is bigger than yourself. Although it can be a scary experience because you're putting your work out on the line, it's also incredibly rewarding because a lot of it comes from you.","I came to New York for school, and then I did this amazing show that was received very well, with a great group of people, and I felt like I was creating something that I was really proud of, and then 'Hamilton' was my next big thing in New York.","I would put on shows for my family.","I decided one day to put on my tutu and jump on the coffee table and sing Aretha Franklin songs for the painters that were painting the house.","There was a saying going around the theatre: It's a train, and you can jump on at any point whether you're a lover of musical theatre or a lover of theatre or a lover of hip-hop or a lover of history - there was a way to jump on the train.","You're able to get into somebody's brain through song.","I like that Amelie is strange, just like me. I'm happy I've gotten to be on this journey following my 'Hamilton' journey because they're so different.","I hope they're reminded that joy is very easy to access if you just put down your phone, look at another person, and make a human connection. You'll find a new experience that you wouldn't have had otherwise."],"Phillips Brooks":["Be patient and understanding. Life is too short to be vengeful or malicious.","Happiness is the natural flower of duty.","I do not pray for a lighter load, but for a stronger back.","The true way to be humble is not to stoop until you are smaller than yourself, but to stand at your real height against some higher nature that will show you what the real smallness of your greatness is.","Forgive, forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours.","Do not pray for tasks equal to your powers. Pray for powers equal to your tasks.","Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones.","No man or woman can be strong, gentle, pure, and good, without the world being better for it and without someone being helped and comforted by the very existence of that goodness.","Life comes before literature, as the material always comes before the work. The hills are full of marble before the world blooms with statues.","Do not pray for easy lives. Pray to be stronger men!","Let every man and woman count himself immortal. Let him catch the revelation of Jesus in his resurrection. Let him say not merely, 'Christ is risen,' but 'I shall rise.'","Set yourself earnestly to see what you are made to do, and then set yourself earnestly to do it.","Sad will be the day for any man when he becomes contented with the thoughts he is thinking and the deeds he is doing - where there is not forever beating at the doors of his soul some great desire to do something larger; which he knows he was meant and made to do.","The ideal life is in our blood and never will be still.","Charity should begin at home, but should not stay there.","The truest help we can render an afflicted man is not to take his burden from him, but to call out his best energy, that he may be able to bear the burden.","Be such a man, and live such a life, that if every man were such as you, and every life a life like yours, this earth would be God's Paradise.","It does not take great men to do great things; it only takes consecrated men.","To say, 'well done' to any bit of good work is to take hold of the powers which have made the effort and strengthen them beyond our knowledge.","Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours.","The feet of the humblest may walk in the field Where the feet of the Holiest trod, This, then, is the marvel to mortals revealed.","No one who has come to true greatness has not felt in some degree that his life belongs to the people, and what God has given them he gives it for mankind.","Jesus Christ, the condescension of divinity, and the exaltation of humanity.","Christianity helps us face the music even when we don't like the tune.","The earth has grown old with its burden of care, but at Christmas it always is young, the heart of the jewel burns lustrous and fair, and its soul full of music breaks the air, when the song of angels is sung.","A prayer in its simplest definition is merely a wish turned Godward.","As you emphasize your life, you must localize and define it... you cannot do everything.","No man has come to true greatness who has not felt that his life belongs to his race, and that which God gives to him, He gives him for mankind.","A man who lives right, and is right, has more power in his silence than another has by his words.","Call your opinions your creed, and you will change them every week.","Make your creed simply and broadly out of the revelation of God, and you will keep it to the end.","The man who has begun to live more seriously within begins to live more simply without.","It is while you are patiently toiling at the little tasks of life that the meaning and shape of the great whole of life dawn on you."],"Philo":["Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.","Those who give hoping to be rewarded with honor are not giving, they are bargaining.","Households, cities, countries, and nations have enjoyed great happiness when a single individual has taken heed of the Good and Beautiful. Such people not only liberate themselves; they fill those they meet with a free mind."],"Philomena Kwao":["No woman anywhere should be denied access to quality healthcare because of race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.","The curvy community has really given me a voice because people want to see someone who looks like they do. They want to know their beauty is valid.","We have spent so many years looking at images of another beauty ideal and so many years taking in magazine covers and films that represent a beauty standard that we'll never meet. People don't realize that there are makeup artists and hairstylists behind the scenes - even in something as simple as a 'candid' Instagram photo.","If you call me 'fat,' it doesn't bother me because I just don't care.","I think that we need to allow words to be words. If my self-esteem and my self-worth linger on words that are used to describe me, then you have a problem in itself.","I'm from Ghana, in West Africa, and all the women in Ghana absolutely love shea butter. We use it for everything, head to toe. I've used it all my life.","When you model, you don't really have control over your image. It can be a good thing, it can be a bad thing. It can be a good thing in the sense that, actually, you have to get reintroduced to yourself. You don't always get that opportunity in your normal life. You can kind of hide from yourself.","Fat is fat. This goes back to the word 'plus.' We describe things. We are humans, and we need to describe things.","If I'm feeling really, really crappy, it sounds so cliche, but if I wake up extra early in the morning and do some sort of physical activity, I usually feel a little bit better. Or I do other things that make me happy.","I love technology. I love the Internet.","I've been lucky enough to do a few editorials in the U.K., but I've never even been on a casting for mainstream commercial work. When I try to understand it, I think people are scared to try something new.","Celebrate the things that make you individual and unique, and realize that there's no one in this world that looks like you.","Put on your bikini, put on whatever you want to wear, and don't worry about what other people are saying.","When I finally discovered the 'Sports Illustrated' swimsuit issue, I browsed through archives and saw a picture of an incredibly stunning model, Damaris Lewis. Her images inspired me, and I imagined being in the magazine myself. Never in a million years did I dream it would actually happen.","In Ghana, most of the women I know do not identify as sexy, and the reason may be cultural. With imported beauty standards from the West, it seems that many African women feel they need to be fair and slim to be beautiful.","The #SwimSexy campaign is redefining standards of beauty, and I'm proud to be a part of it. My hope is that this campaign connects with women and girls of all ages, body-types, races, and backgrounds.","I think the real problem is all the negative connotations people have with that term. They think, 'Oh my God! I don't want to be 'plus-size!'' But people attach too much significance to terms. We can't let these terms define us or our beauty.","Women I've met in different countries have told me that seeing my face in magazines gives them the courage to love themselves.","We are all beautiful.","Sometimes you never realise how much of an effect you're having on people until you're told, and the fan mail I receive has made me very aware of the positive effects I have on other people.","As a woman of color and curve model, I never imagined when I started modeling that I would be featured in the pages of 'Sports Illustrated.'","If a brand wants a specific girl, they want a specific girl, wherever you are.","By being present and being true, I believe that, in my own way, I am promoting diversity.","The brands that choose to use me, my agency and social media have given me a face and a voice.","I hope to show people everywhere that you can be unapologetically you and still succeed. I also hope that by using more diverse models, brands can see that there is power in diversity, and not shy away from doing something new for fear of failure. The effects are bigger than just the fashion industry.","You cannot determine someone's health by the BMI alone. There are many factors that contribute to the health on an individual. If we're going to start using BMI to police straight size models, what's next? The plus size industry? To be honest, if it was down to BMI alone, most plus size models - including myself - wouldn't be working.","I think it's just that the fashion industry can only accept one thing at a time. It's like, 'OK, well, if we're going to add plus, then let's keep it hourglass and white.'","Everyone needs to realize the responsibility they hold and realize where they can make a difference.","You can't say you're inclusive when you only have one plus-size, hourglass white model.","Because of social media, it's bridged the gap between the advertisers and fashion and allowed people to find their group. It really widens what people are viewing and allows brands to see what the public wants to see.","My journey into modeling began completely by chance. I was in school finishing up my master's degree in health management and policy when a friend entered me into an online modeling competition.","I try not to assign labels to myself. Sometimes I shop in the plus section, and sometimes I don't. I feel we attach too much significance to labels, and ultimately, it doesn't really matter.","There is beauty everywhere. But if I had to narrow it down, I absolutely adore Beyonce. She's the ultimate icon for me. I also love Naomi CampbelI, Jourdan Dunn, Joan Smalls, Daria Werbowy, and Genevieve Nnaji.","I believe I'm beautiful because I'm me. I also believe that if you can find beauty in everything, you can allow that to change your mind-set, and doing so makes you a happier person.","Torrid has given me an amazing opportunity. I can reach out to different girls and help them realize that they are beautiful, too.","I think that the plus-size industry has been great with size diversity, but it hasn't really been great for skin tone diversity.","Growing up, I had body confidence issues, not really so much because of size but my skin color. I had trouble recognizing that the depth of my skin tone is really beautiful because whenever people referred to a beautiful black-skinned woman, you'd see Beyonce and Rihanna.","When I started, there was only one other girl that I could name that was even close to my shade. I didn't understand why there weren't more black plus-size models with darker skin tones. It feels like the final frontier of beauty is to be black, to be plus, to have natural hair.","There's not many models in the U.S. that have my depth - like, really dark skin - that are also plus size. Skin color has been one of those things we haven't really, really addressed on a large, widespread scale.","For me, less is more. I don't often wear makeup, but when I do, a little concealer and some powder go a long way.","I have to congratulate L'Oreal on its True Match foundation range. It's my go-to foundation, and I absolutely love it.","My hair is extremely dry and fragile, so moisture is key. I love black castor oil, shea butter, and lots of water.","My best advice is to celebrate your own unique features and never put them down. There is beauty in individuality, and it's so important to appreciate everything your body allows you to do. It's OK to have a down day - we all do from time to time - but it's not OK to compare yourself to others.","Before I went to boarding school, I had never read a fashion magazine. I grew up on a council estate in London, and fashion magazines were a luxury item that weren't even on my mind. The closest I got to a fashion magazine was my cousin's 'Top of the Pops' magazines, where we would learn the lyrics to every song and put posters on our walls.","Magazines don't go far enough to be inclusive and have at least have one model representing every major skin tone.","Much noise has been about size diversity but not enough about skin tone diversity. It's time for this to change.","It isn't hard to see how the lack of representation affects the self esteem of many women world wide.","War and armed conflict disproportionately affect women and can turn what is supposed to be a joyous and beautiful experience - childbirth - into a horrific or even fatal one.","I grew up in the U.K. and now reside in the United States, and my family is from Ghana.","My mother was born in Ghana, but she moved to the U.K. when my sisters and I were born.","Women are hit especially hard in regions of ongoing conflict. Before, during, and after conflict, women bear the brunt of the consequences of war. They are left as the providers and guardians, responsible for rebuilding their country one family at a time.","I am from Ghana, and although Ghana is celebrated as a relatively peaceful country in a historically war-torn region, the issues of development and recovery are still apparent.","While education is hugely important, the ways in which women are portrayed in their communities are equally important. Portraying women as victims keeps women in a captive space and denies them of their agency: their ability to fight back and take ownership of their situation.","Women need to be empowered to shape their own livelihoods and become CEOs of their own lives. They must be allowed to take control of important life decisions that are so often decided by others.","Fast fashion, whilst having increased the accessibility of stylish clothes for millions, has unfortunately resulted in many horrific practises, such as child labour, that exploit millions of people around the world in poorer, developing countries. This something that has to change, and we can all start by reflecting on where our clothes come from.","For me, diverse beauty is an affirmation of every single person in his or her own skin.","Women of all ethnicities, complexions, and sizes want to be able to wear makeup and nice clothes. No one wants to go out and feel like they're substandard or that there's only one mold that they don't fit.","'Sports Illustrated' has set the standard for what a swimsuit model should be. For a magazine that has that much influence to include models of different body types on their pages shows that they're breaking down old beauty ideals while opening the doors of diversity and inclusivity.","It's refreshing when plus-size styling is exciting and pushes boundaries rather than safe and boring.","I've inherited so much culture, beauty, and love, and I'm the perfect mix of Philomena.","I try my best to stay healthy by paying attention to the ingredients in foods and trying to make sure my food is organic and not full of sugar or preservatives. I also try to do at least 30 minutes of cardio every day in the gym.","New York City is one of the best cities in the world for walking: it's virtually impossible to get lost.","Beauty, to me, is not a physical thing. It's a feeling.","One misconception I think is wrong is that being a larger size means, somehow, that you're neglecting your body, or you don't look after yourself, or you don't love yourself enough to lose weight. We've been saturated with the idea that to be happy you must be thin, or to be healthy you must be thin.","I try and work out as much as I can because when you exercise, it releases endorphins and makes you feel really good. I also make sure I schedule time with my friends, family, and loved ones because I realize that, as well as your physical well-being, you have to look out for your mental well-being, too.","I have a green juice every day because it makes me feel more awake; it makes my skin healthier.","My mom and my sisters have helped me to be comfortable with who I am. It's a process of loving yourself as you are. I can say that it's been a journey. I see the changes little by little.","Health management is my passion, and I hope to further my career in that area in the future.","My goal is always to help other women with programs that help them live better lives, especially is areas where health care is missing. Both of my parents are from Ghana, where there is a need for health care in the smaller villages.","I want to use my voice to better health care for pregnant women.","It's refreshing to see plus women being treated as part of the fashion community as a whole and not just a separate piece or separate different thing.","I think, for so long, women of different sizes have been pigeonholed, and with every campaign, it's always an adaptation of making fashion but for plus sizes. Sometimes it's in a little bit of a negative way, and plus is always a little bit slow to be fashion forward.","Plus-sized women have been told for so long to cover up. Whether it's with a one-piece, a tankini, a bikini with a skirt, high-waisted things, we're always told to hide these things that society calls flaws.","I think the fashion industry and the media industry in general have a responsibility to make sure that they celebrate the rich differences in all our backgrounds to make sure we don't fall into the trap of reducing beauty to one specific mold."],"Phoebe Cary":["And though hard be the task, 'Keep a stiff upper lip'.","One sweetly solemn thought, comes to me o'er and o'er; I am nearer home today, than I ever have been before.","Death comes not to the living soul, nor age to the loving heart."],"Phoebe Cates":["Practical gifts are another great way to be thoughtful, and they work for anything from birthdays to dinner-party gifts.","Too many people are buying gifts for themselves when they pick out a gift for a friend.","You'd be surprised how inspired you'll be when you go into a different store than the one you normally go to for gifts.","A tea set is good for a newborn girl. It is a gift that instantly makes the room a girl's room.","When you start out, you have to make compromises, which include doing films of lower quality.","Modeling teaches you to be completely conscious of the camera. Acting is being totally unconscious of it.","There are a lot of actors out there who've made one or two films and who never work again.","People follow proven formulas in any business."],"Phoebe Philo":["I find mediocrity hard. I find that whole area difficult. I'm a very passionate person; I care very much about what I do. I believe I give it a lot, so it's gotta be good; otherwise, what's the point?","What I love is this idea of a wardrobe, the idea that we're establishing certain signatures and updating them, that a change in colour or fabric is enough.","I'm just not very interested in decoration.","I was very, very eager to work. It's just the way I am.","My relationship with fashion is playful and very expressive of what I'm feeling at the time.","I feel very much that I am a human being, with human limitations, and I need to respect that.","I'm not interested in clothes that just convey a certain look or fashion. Clothes for me have always been a form of self-expression.","My mother used to dress me in quite good-taste clothes, and I really wanted things that were sparkly and spangly and trashy and nasty. I don't know if I ever chose fashion; it was just there in me.","The older I get, and the more collections I do, the more I'm driven by real style and beauty. My aim is to reveal and not to display women.","I'm happy to do interviews from time to time, but I don't find them that necessary - and that hasn't seemed to have affected people's understanding of our work.","I had my daughter, and with that came a deep sense of responsibility; my time for work had become precious, and it had to have more meaning.","I don't know whether that comes from having a family - having something very important at home that needed to be protected.","Things have to sell, of course, but if I don't want to put bags on the runway, we don't put bags on the runway. I have complete creative control.","Women should have choices, and women should feel good in what they wear.","I decided to work on things that obsess women because women can't resist things like lace, sequins, animal prints and python.","I wouldn't want to even try to begin to describe our customer, as I think she likes a certain amount of anonymity. I try to offer clothes that allow that. I myself do not like being defined so readily, so I imagine that she is similar?","I have a fantastic team, and it's much easier having children, because that creates a natural limit.","I do like the idea of women not showing too much, of them being quite reserved in a way, and quite covered.","I never had a massive desire to buy clothes. I liked to customise the clothes I already had or was given when I was younger. If I didn't like them that much, I made them how I wanted them to be.","I want to show my personality through my designs and stay pretty anonymous outside the industry.","When I was deciding whether or not to take the job at Celine, I didn't really look at the history of the house. I had other offers to come back, but they weren't right, or they wouldn't let me stay in London, which was non-negotiable.","Time is my biggest luxury. Finding time to do things outside of fashion, which I think for a designer is incredibly important.","I don't believe in making fashion difficult.","My favourite eras for styles are still the 70s and 40s, and there will be a few iconic pieces to build the wardrobe around, like there were at Chloe, but I want there to be a feel of mix-and-match.","There is absolutely a gap in the market for thirty something women and, the more I look at it, the more I feel there needs to be a sense of ease and choice.","I have an innate fear of fame. I've never thought being famous looked like such a good place to be. I love being incognito.","Until you go through with it yourself, you simply can't imagine it. But it is the transition of going back to work and the guilt of how much time you spend with your child that's hard. I worry about not getting back in time for bath-time. I am not a neurotic person at all, but every time the mobile rings, my stomach leaps.","I just have to be very, very organised.","Everyone wants new things all the time; shops require so much - there has to be consistency.","I try not to intellectualise what I do.","Because I'm a woman, and I'm petite and blonde, you wouldn't believe how often I'm asked to model the clothes.","It's been a bit tricky trying to establish a 'designer' profile and not a designer-cum-girl-around-town."],"Phoebe Snow":["I faded away for a while out of necessity.","Sometimes when you're overwhelmed by a situation - when you're in the darkest of darkness - that's when your priorities are reordered.","I wanted to be the greatest woman guitarist alive. I had fantasies about being a female Jimi Hendrix.","If the baby is sick, you won't find me showing up to play my gigs. If I have a contract, there is going to be a clause in that contract saying that if the baby is sick I will not appear.","I was totally ignored for a while... that's a hazard of signing with a small company who say how small they are and how close to the artists they are. Suddenly they don't have any time for you.","I've sort of made up my mind that I have to do my career and I have to be a mother. These are my two responsibilities; of course the baby comes first.","With my quick success, I didn't have time to learn the ropes of the music business. Because my first record was such a hit, I was terribly spoiled and I thought I couldn't do anything wrong. I was also desperate to make tons of money because of my responsibility to my daughter. And there was no longer any joy in making music.","The thing that helped me come to terms with performing was an anxiety, a desperation for acceptance. There was never enough positive motivation in my life.","Back then, I was an acoustically-oriented artist. Honestly, 'Poetry Man' wouldn't have been my first choice.","It's no sin to admit that you feel vulnerable and lost.","The first album was a very successful record. It made me very visible and it's an immediate association, but I don't do that anymore. Now I'm true to myself as an artist again. I'm more vocally oriented.","The most common misconception about me is that I'm basically a jazz singer.","I'm not a folk or jazz singer, more a hard-edged pop singer - with some rock, and song hooks.","My life was very tenuous last year. My daughter's death, in March in 2007, was unexpected. It was a shock. I didn't know if I'd survive it.","Once I get out onstage, it's the same sort of basic production that it is anywhere else. But I might be a little bit aware that there might be people I know out there, who wondered where I was.","I would like to do something autobiographical, set to music. I don't know how I'm going to do it, but I'm going to try.","There's a fascinating school of thought that some women are relationship addicts. You get really strung out on a guy who's not returning your enthusiasm and tell yourself you're going to fix him and make him better, and of course it's impossible.","I lost interest in being in the public eye.","All of my life, when things got too difficult, I folded up the tent and went to bed. I couldn't stand a challenge... I was terrified of confrontation. I was very laid-back, and just wouldn't get involved or fight back.","I realized that I've lived half my life already, and it's time to believe in - and stand up for - myself.","There were times when I had maybe a couple of hundred dollars, and times I made myself think I was on top of the world.","I know there's a consciousness energy that operates completely independent of the physical body you inhabit, that maintains... awareness after the body's gone.","A friend hipped me to hypoglycemia, which an article I read calls 'a disease for a nation of sugar junkies.' Who knows how many people in this country have it?","Give me a strapless gown and a rhinestone-studded guitar and some 55-year-olds in my audience, along with their kids and grandkids. Don't give me 'boogie'!"],"Phoebe Tonkin":["Being healthy is something I learned from a very young age. Looking after yourself on the inside helps with your energy, makes your skin glow, and changes your whole outlook on life.","I don't know, I'm literally the most awkward, socially strange person.","I'm obsessed with muffins.","Chanel No. 5 is my perfume when I'm feeling like a lady. It's old-school and warm - and it reminds me of my mom.","Natural beauty products are a must! I use coconut oil-based RMS makeup, and I slather almond oil on my hands to soak while I watch a movie.","There isn't a lot of work in Australia. I think that's why everyone comes over to America to find jobs and pilots and things, because there's not enough work to justify staying there, unfortunately. Like, I wish there was. I would love to stay home and be working with my family around the corner, but the work just isn't there.","I want the feuds to come back - there aren't enough rap feuds anymore. I want a serious rap-off.","I can't go without Vegemite, a salty spread from Australia. I put it on toast, and it brings me back to being a kid. I make sure to put it in my bag because I'm always on the road.","I love shopping at Zara or Topshop. I'm not going to go out and spend $1,200 on a Chloe top that I'm probably going to spill something on.","I love doing comedy and I love watching comedy... I'm more inclined to go watch a Seth Rogen film than a serious Oscar drama.","I think Americans are probably getting sick of us Australians trying to take their jobs.","No one knows who I am in Australia. They don't even know I am Australian, because 'The Secret Circle' is on in Australia, and I'm sure everyone's like, 'Oh, she's American. She's from, like, North Carolina.' Like, nobody knows me in Australia, I'm just telling you.","I really, really like 'In Rainbows.' But I also really like 'OK Computer' as a sort of flipside to that. 'Reckoner' is my favorite, just my favorite Radiohead song. That, 'Idioteque,' and 'Pyramid Song' are my top three.","It must surprise people that I'm such a rap fan, but it's true. Sometimes, just staying in, putting on some rap music, and letting loose is all I need to have a good time.","I enjoy staying home with friends more than going out. The other night, for example, my girlfriends and I stayed in listening to some '90s rap - my favorite kind. We were in the Hamptons and made it an all-Biggie weekend, all of his albums on repeat. I loved it.","I'm into the lyrical side of rap. I listen to some old Eminem songs and think, 'Wow, he's a genius.' He's one of the greatest poets of our time. Even when he's out of control, like on 'Cold Wind Blows,' it's incredible.","I grew up watching 'Dawson's Creek,' and I started watching 'The Vampire Diaries' when I was auditioning because I wanted to get a feel of it... then I totally got hooked!","I loved Gwyneth Paltrow in 'The Royal Tenenbaums' and Reese Witherspoon in 'Election.' I love quirky films and characters like that.","I grew up on the beach. It's just a way of life. You don't seek out that lifestyle; it's just day-to-day.","I'm not a crazy granola person. I like to wear beautiful clothes, and I like having a glass of wine, but it doesn't mean I don't work out every day and drink green juices.","I used to be that crazy person that was strict about what I did and didn't eat. I was so diligent with exercise. And as soon as I stopped thinking about it, I lost weight. I wasn't stressing about it. The balance and relaxing is what's really helped me.","In wintertime I like to wear flannel button down pyjamas, and in summer I prefer to wear, well... nothing.","I rely on my iPad for on-the-go entertainment. I stock it with TV shows, like 'Parks and Recreation' and the British version of 'The Office.' I'm reading a Charles Manson biography on it too, since I'm weirdly into true crime.","Every day, without fail, I eat some dark chocolate.","Los Angeles and Sydney are very similar, but I definitely enjoy more fresh seafood when I'm back in Australia, as there is so much great, fresh produce here. I also like going swimming at the beach while I'm home, too."],"Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka":["I'm certainly hoping that all the recommendations that we have heard will be implemented.","But had they not paid that advance we would have lost much more, we would have started to go and look for the product all over again, the refinery would have stopped working.","They are responsible for starting this relationship and wanting to help Africa. The United States is very well suited for this as they are a country that has the capacity, they have better access to technology and they are a successful country.","They've participated extensively in this conference and they are doing their best to help.","We hope that there will be better policy-making and hope to see projects implemented. We have lots of information that can be used for the implementation of projects."],"Phylicia Rashad":["Any time women come together with a collective intention, it's a powerful thing. Whether it's sitting down making a quilt, in a kitchen preparing a meal, in a club reading the same book, or around the table playing cards, or planning a birthday party, when women come together with a collective intention, magic happens.","Loving oneself isn't hard, when you understand who and what 'yourself' is. It has nothing to do with the shape of your face, the size of your eyes, the length of your hair or the quality of your clothes. It's so beyond all of those things and it's what gives life to everything about you. Your own self is such a treasure.","I am having a good time doing nothing.","Everything you do, every thought you have, every word you say creates a memory that you will hold in your body. It's imprinted on you and affects you in subtle ways - ways you are not always aware of. With that in mind, be very conscious and selective.","There's always something to suggest that you'll never be who you wanted to be. Your choice is to take it or keep on moving.","The stubbornness I had as a child has been transmitted into perseverance. I can let go but I don't give up. I don't beat myself up about negative things.","If the playwright knew every little thing about his play, why bother? There must be discovery all the time, otherwise why bother to do it?","Let me just say that to imagine racism does not exist is imagination. And to imagine that it does not create its own set of problems is true imagination. So let's not imagine that racism is gone, extinguished, because it's not. We are seeing this in the top levels of the political arena, and we are seeing it very, very plainly.","What's in front of you is a whole world of experiences beyond your imagination. Put yourself, and your growth and development, first.","I think the real understanding comes when we recognize our humanity in each other. That's not just between blacks and whites. That's between all religions as well.","What he showed me was not what I had to get, but what I already have. I am just myself, and who I am is a lot.","Without an educated populace, democracy cannot sustain itself.","Success for me means being able to work. I don't look at so much at what I've done as much as I look to what I will do.","There was a time when I couldn't watch sitcoms for a while because it was just cacophony, it was just noise.","When I am presented with good work, I accept it. Wherever it is.","What I love about being an actress is being able to really look into myself and understand another human being.","Historically, if you look at great civilizations, why do they crumble? Is it because of what's outside or because of something internal? It's always internal. It is.","We are told there is not enough money for education, but somehow there is enough money for people to raise billions of dollars to defeat somebody in an election? Oh! Okay! Does that make sense?","How is it that you profess love for God but can't accept another human being?","A person can be big, because of spirit. A person can be big because of their position in the family, the hierarchy in the family. That role has been played by women who are quite thin.","I love theater. To have the people onstage right there, to be working in concert with other artists, this is a like a school of fish moving together.","Every role affords me something different in the way of understanding, and that's really why you take these roles, not to show that thing that people talk about of showing what you can do - that has nothing to do with anything.","Let's just say that the theater is not for the faint of heart.","Things have a way of moving to the left, and then they move back to the right before somebody finds themselves in the center. That seems to be the nature of the creative world. It's not stagnant. I don't get upset about it.","If there are no films or plays of interest to me, I don't go. I know how to go to a museum or a library or pick up a good magazine or I can watch the sun set. I know how to live. There's a whole creation out there full of magic and wonder to be explored.","As artists, we do the work that we do. Receiving an award or not receiving an award in no way diminishes one's talent or value.","There's all kinds of mothers, so to use the label 'mother' and to think you really understood all that a human being is because she's a mother, is a mistake.","If I had known being insane was so much fun, I'd have gone crazy long ago.","Acting's not about nose jobs and liposuction. It's about being truthful to what you're doing."],"Phyllida Lloyd":["Onstage, there's a separation between character and audience; onscreen, you can go to a deeper place.","The power of a close-up can be extraordinary, but you have to have actors who are able to reveal themselves.","When I began to direct, I discovered that I was much more comfortable than I was acting.","It was extraordinary to experience 'Mamma Mia!' What an injection of good spirit and heart it was.","I think courage is commensurate with your fear - if you lack imagination and you're fearless, that's not courage to me.","You can't wait for someone to discover you; you have to just get on and do it. Have confidence that directing is a very suitable job for a woman - with our gift for collaboration, listening, and reading the nuance of things.","In a way, 'Mamma Mia!' was such a left-field thing for me.","In a way, the debate about Margaret Thatcher in Britain has just gotten fossilized in this notion that she is either this she-devil who wrecked the industrial base of the country and ruined the lives of millions, or she is the blessed Margaret who saved the nation and rescued us from our post-war decline.","I was given a mask of myself by Frances Barber when we opened 'Julius Caesar.' I looked much younger and prettier. Wearing it was certainly cheaper than Botox.","Do as much theatre as you can while you're at school.","I wanted to be an actress from about the age of five.","I was hellbent on going to drama school, but my mother, rightly, panicked and persuaded me to go to university on the grounds that a degree would be 'something to fall back on.' Whilst at college, I realised I wasn't good enough or robust enough to be an actress.","There's something about doing Shakespeare with a single gender, whether it is all-male or all-female, that opens up certain possibilities. You are able to throw the behavior of the men into a particular relief and be playful within a slightly larger-than-life way with it.","Shakespeare was writing about his time, and it was a time when women were beginning to demand a voice, demand a say in their lives for one reason or another, mainly to do with the economics of the time.","When I was asked to read a screenplay about Margaret Thatcher, I think I felt immediate apprehension.","I realised you could become fat and bald as a director and still remain employable.","I worked on live studio drama, which was one weird aberration in the 1980s. I worked on the 'Battle of Waterloo,' and my job was to reload the Brown Bess muskets - the only time the audience realised it was live was when somebody leant on a button and plunged the whole studio into blackout.","It's the job of the artist to take something that everybody thinks they know about, they've made a decision about, they will be immovable on, and to shine a light on it.","If you believe that how you do your work is as influential as the work you do, then a theatre rehearsal, which is a microcosm of the world, is the perfect place to model social change because if it doesn't work this time, you can try again on the next production.","In management terms, directing opera certainly prepares you for a film set: the magnitude of it, the experts in other fields that you have to call on. Both are massive ensemble jobs in which there's incredible pressure to get things done on time and on budget - so much so that making the wrong decision may be better than making no decision at all.","Opera is too obsessed with buildings.","To be invited to the Park - the greatest free Shakespeare festival in the world - is a great honor, and I don't take it lightly.","As a woman, I think Margaret Thatcher felt she had to be ten times more prepared than the men.","Margaret Thatcher was pro-choice. She voted to decriminalize homosexuality. Was not profoundly religious. She was very liberal on social issues.","I think I wanted to do something that retained the improvised chaos of 'Mamma Mia' the theatre show which set it apart from all the slick packaged productions.","Margaret Thatcher always felt like an outsider in her party.","Directing is quite a nuts-and-bolts thing. It's a mixture of creating an atmosphere in which actors can feel safe enough to be dangerous.","Art is all about giving yourself these terrifying challenges, these peaks to climb. You're at the bottom of the mountain at the start of every new project thinking, 'Am I going to make it?'","Movie-making is an extreme sport on many levels. It requires stamina such as I had never imagined.","In Europe, it is not so unusual for directors to move between opera, theatre, and film, and I have at least three girlfriends I can think of who have directed in all three genres.","In the theatre in the U.K., women are at the very top of the tree as freelance directors.","I have been very lucky, and I think it all goes back to state subsidy for the arts. I gained my training and confidence and credentials in the not-for-profit world, and in England, that does not mean on the fringe of things. It means right at the centre.","In the not-for-profit world, I never felt that being female was an impediment. I was, however, given my break into commercial theatre by a female producer, Judy Craymer, and women - in particular, Donna Langley, president of production at Universal - were crucial in giving 'Mamma Mia' a home in Hollywood.","If you're an actor, you have to look spiffing. But as the director, you don't need to look so glamorous.","I didn't really realize I was a woman director until I walked onto the set at Pinewood Studios when I did 'Mamma Mia!' and everybody was calling each other 'Governor' and 'Sir'... and then, looking at me, 'Well... good morning!'","'The Handmaid's Tale' is a horrifying and horrifyingly possible vision of the future.","One is always attracted to pieces of theatre with great roles for women.","In London, it's quite a rarefied activity to be on an analyst's couch.","I realized that I didn't think I could stand the psychological battering that actors have to withstand. I just felt I wasn't cut out for that kind of self-promotion.","If you have bad hair and you bite your nails, nobody expects that you can't direct plays.","I started working in London, and I've been free-lance ever since.","Frankly, I find it very odd that, in a population that's more than 50 per cent of women, that Hollywood isn't producing more movies to cater to that audience. The demographic is being grossly underserved, in my opinion.","To have Hollywood tell me or other women like me that we're not a market that interests them is silly. Good stories work.","I think Margaret Thatcher was a superstar in this country, and I think we all felt we needed a superstar to play her, somebody of huge intelligence, passion, and power and warmth."],"Phyllis A. Whitney":["A writer is what I am.","I offer optimism. All my books have happy endings. I don't see any point in letting my readers down at the end. I'm an optimist - people feel that in my books.","I tell a good story.","I always want to live long enough to finish the book I'm working on and see it published. But then I start another book before the previous one is in the stores, so I always have a reason to go on.","I didn't learn to drive until I was 65 and my husband was seriously ill.","Getting the ideas are a struggle for me. I'm doing better now that I use the concentration tapes. More unusual ideas.","People have talents that are different. Where does the creative flow come from - inside us or from a higher power?

I just write it down.","The girls in my books are out solving their own problems.","I've always done what I wanted to do.","I like to write about beautiful places, interesting places to me.","I wish I could think of a suitable name for the kind of writing I do."],"Phyllis Battelle":["A broken heart is what makes life so wonderful five years later, when you see the guy in an elevator and he is fat and smoking a cigar and saying long-time-no-see.","For her fifth wedding, the bride wore black and carried a scotch and soda.","If you haven't had at least a slight poetic crack in the heart, you have been cheated by nature.","A reporter discovers, in the course of many years of interviewing celebrities, that most actors are more attractive behind a spotlight than over a spot of tea."],"Phyllis Bottome":["To be in the right is often an expensive business.","Neither situations nor people can be altered by the interference of an outsider. If they are to be altered, that alteration must come from within.","Truth, though it has many disadvantages, is at least changeless. You can always find it where you left it.","There are two ways of meeting difficulties: you alter the difficulties or you alter yourself meeting them.","It is very a dangerous thing to have an idea that you will not practice.","There is nothing final about a mistake, except its being taken as final."],"Phyllis Diller":["A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.","Aim high, and you won't shoot your foot off.","Housework can't kill you, but why take a chance?","Best way to get rid of kitchen odors: Eat out.","You know you're old when someone compliments you on your alligator shoes, and you're barefoot.","The reason women don't play football is because 11 of them would never wear the same outfit in public.","The only time I ever enjoyed ironing was the day I accidentally got gin in the steam iron.","I asked the waiter, 'Is this milk fresh?'

Then I want to move in with them.","Never go to bed mad. Stay up and fight.","A bachelor is a guy who never made the same mistake once.","My recipe for dealing with anger and frustration: set the kitchen timer for twenty minutes, cry, rant, and rave, and at the sound of the bell, simmer down and go about business as usual.","Cleaning your house while your kids are still growing up is like shoveling the walk before it stops snowing.","You know you're old if your walker has an airbag.","There's so little money in my bank account, my scenic checks show a ghetto.","We spend the first twelve months of our children's lives teaching them to walk and talk and the next twelve telling them to sit down and shut up.","Old age is when the liver spots show through your gloves.","Burt Reynolds once asked me out.

Turned out to be a trick knee.","I wanted to become me, totally me. The more me, the better. I instinctively knew this and I was right.","Most children threaten at times to run away from home. This is the only thing that keeps some parents going.","Always be nice to your children because they are the ones who will choose your rest home.","I buried a lot of my ironing in the back yard.","I admit, I have a tremendous sex drive. My boyfriend lives forty miles away.","Tranquilizers work only if you follow the advice on the bottle - keep away from children.","Any time three New Yorkers get into a cab without an argument, a bank has just been robbed.","It's a good thing that beauty is only skin deep, or I'd be rotten to the core.","His finest hour lasted a minute and a half.","My cooking is so bad my kids thought Thanksgiving was to commemorate Pearl Harbor.","My own laugh is the real thing and I've had it all my life.","If it weren't for baseball, many kids wouldn't know what a millionaire looked like.","I've been asked to say a couple of words about my husband, Fang.

Singers get applause at the end of their song no matter how bad they are.","The last thing I'd learn, well into my career, was how to get on, how to say hello, how to get in with the audience."],"Phyllis Eisenstein":["As long as I could remember, I had looked forward to a handful of wonderful events - a total eclipse of the sun, the return of Halley's Comet, and the first trip to the Moon. I've still never seen that eclipse, and Halley's comet was a disappointment, but my sense of wonder was diamond-bright on that July 20, 1969.","I have a very sardonic view of life.","I follow only one rule in my writing, and that is to be interesting. If the story is interesting to you, the writer, then it will probably be interesting to somebody else."],"Phyllis George":["Crafts make us feel rooted, give us a sense of belonging and connect us with our history. Our ancestors used to create these crafts out of necessity, and now we do them for fun, to make money and to express ourselves.","There's a fine line between being sweet and innocent and being a tough broad.","Often I used my gut instinct to ask the questions and get the answers I thought the audience wanted to hear. Sometimes the interviewees said things that surprised even them.","Banish the words 'I can't' from your vocabulary.

I've been staggered by how commonplace it is.","If you find yourself caring for a relative with dementia, the chances are you'll need help.","When somebody's calling you 'Mommy,' it's a wonderful thing. But also to have that responsibility and to know that you and your partner have this little thing that's totally relying on you - and it made me, I suppose, less selfish. Not that I was mega-selfish to start with, but it's lovely having that responsibility. It's scary.","I spend long days wearing a corset - but no pain, no gain.","If you're going out for a meal with friends, and they say they can't afford to go to such and such a place, you can't force them to afford it.","'Downton Abbey' about upper-class posh people: of course it is.","Because I came from a small town outside Glasgow, nobody from my school had ever gone into the acting profession. It was just something you didn't do. You joined the bank or became a teacher or whatever you did.","Sadly, my father died before I graduated, so he didn't see any of the success at all.","It's true as a woman, particularly: the older you get, the parts get thinner on the ground and not quite as interesting, that's for sure.","I think it's healthy to say, 'I'm 58 and, do you know what, this is what a 58-year-old woman looks like.'","I don't think you can underestimate how much carers need some support.","I worry about the world.","Why do people want to kill and maim and pillage?

But it is an earned thing. It has to be deserved, like a hug from a child.","Sisters are always drying their hair.

They think it is about advance and success for women, but it's not that at all. It is about power for the female left. And they have this, I think, ridiculous idea that American women are oppressed by the patriarchy and we need laws and government to solve our problems for us.","I think the main goal of the feminist movement was the status degradation of the full-time homemaker. They really wanted to get all women out of the homes and into the workforce. And again and again, they taught that the only fulfilling lifestyle was to be in the workforce reporting to a boss instead of being in the home reporting to a husband.","Since the women are the ones who bear the babies, and there's nothing we can do about that, our laws and customs then make it the financial obligation of the husband to provide the support. It is his obligation and his sole obligation. And this is exactly and precisely what we will lose if the Equal Rights Amendment is passed.","ERA means abortion funding, means homosexual privileges, means whatever else.","Our public school system is our country's biggest and most inefficient monopoly, yet it keeps demanding more and more money.","Anyone with a child knows that children learn about the world through binary options: up or down, hot or cold, big or little, inside or outside, wet or dry, good or bad, boy or girl, man or woman.","What I am defending is the real rights of women. A woman should have the right to be in the home as a wife and mother.","Putting women in military combat is the cutting edge of the feminist goal to force us into an androgynous society.","Every country that has experimented with women in actual combat has abandoned the idea, and the notion that Israel uses women in combat is a feminist myth.","Feminism is doomed to failure because it is based on an attempt to repeal and restructure human nature.","Sexual harassment on the job is not a problem for virtuous women.","Location is the key to most businesses, and the entrepreneurs typically build their reputation at a particular spot.","Men should stop treating feminists like ladies, and instead treat them like the men they say they want to be.","Remember, those that wait upon the Lord will rise up with wings like eagles, and they will run and not be weary. And don't you ever be weary, because the battle goes on, year after year, and we need all of you young people to join us in the battle.","No country in history ever sent mothers of toddlers off to fight enemy soldiers until the United States did this in the Iraq war.","Of course climate changes. Many changes are due to factors over which humans have no control, such as winds, ocean currents, and sun activity. But the liberals want us to believe that climate change is also caused by gases expelled when humans burn so-called fossil fuels.","The cornerstone of the political correctness that dominates campus culture is radical feminism.","Much of the demand for women in combat comes from female officers who are eager for medals and promotions.","When it comes to determining child custody, however, sexism is the rule.","Big Brother is on the march. A plan to subject all children to mental health screening is underway, and the pharmaceuticals are gearing up for bigger sales of psychotropic drugs.","In a world of inhumanity, war and terrorism, American citizenship is a very precious possession.","Sex education classes are like in-home sales parties for abortions.","The European nations' loss of sovereignty to the EU should be a warning to Americans.","There's no real substitute for the care of the real mother.","Feminists don't honor successful women. You never hear them talking about Margaret Thatcher. Take Condoleezza Rice. She's a remarkable, successful woman. You don't hear the feminists talk about her or Carly Fiorina or Jeanne Kirkpatrick.","If we don't stop immigration - this torrent of immigrants coming in - we're not going to be America anymore because most of the people coming in have no experience with limited government. They don't know what that is.","I would not want to be called a feminist. The feminists don't believe in success for women and, of course, I believe that American women are the most fortunate people who ever lived on the face of the earth, can do anything they make up their minds to do.","Feminism has changed the way women think, and it has changed the way men think, but the trouble is, it hasn't changed the attitudes of babies at all.","It would be a tragic mistake for Congress ever to adopt any public or tax policy which encourages mothers to assign child care to others and enter the labor force.","Many professors are Marxists or other varieties of radicals who hate America.","Any judge who allows an adulterer with a live-in girlfriend to terminate the life of his wife should be impeached.","The most frequent complaint I hear from college students is that professors inject their leftist political comments into their courses even when they have nothing to do with the subject.","It's not the physical location of birth that defines citizenship, but whether your parents are citizens, and the express or implied consent to jurisdiction of the sovereign.","The real fight is within the Republican Party to get it to nominate grassroots-type candidates who the public wants, and not just some 'echo' of the other side.","When I had a baby, I didn't leave the second floor for six months. I nursed my babies. I was a full-time homemaker. I taught them all how to read before I let them go to school. So I gave them that care in the early life that somehow feminists have been led to believe is demeaning and is not worth the time of an educated woman.","I went through college while working a full-time manual-labor job, and I don't regret a minute of it; it was a great learning experience.","Suppose the pay gap between men and women were magically eliminated. If that happened, simple arithmetic suggests that half of women would be unable to find what they regard as a suitable mate.","It is long overdue for parents to realize they have the right and duty to protect our children against the intolerant evolutionists.","History offers no evidence for the proposition that the assignment of women to military combat jobs is the way to win wars, improve combat readiness, or promote national security.","Forcing women in or near land combat will hurt recruiting, not help.","Bite us once, shame on the dog; bite us repeatedly, shame on us for allowing it.","People think that child-support enforcement benefits children, but it doesn't.","It is a mystery why any Americans would support the concept of the EU.","Now that judges embrace forcibly starving someone to death, Congress should use its appropriation power to starve the judicial budget.","Our runaway judiciary is badly in need of restraint by Congress.","The most dangerous area where our laws are not being faithfully executed are the laws designed to protect Americans against the millions of aliens who enter our country illegally every year.","And the first commandment of feminism is: I am woman; thou shalt not tolerate strange gods who assert that women have capabilities or often choose roles that are different from men's.","After Big Media, U.S. colleges and universities are the biggest enemies of the values of red-state Americans.","The worst censors are those prohibiting criticism of the theory of evolution in the classroom.","How can we protect homeland security unless the government stops the invasion of illegal aliens?","National Standards was not a narrative of past events but was leftwing revisionism and Political Correctness.","Congress should pass legislation to remove from the federal courts their jurisdiction to hear these outrageous challenges to the Ten Commandments and the Pledge of Allegiance.","Becoming a resident of a state may confer the right to get a driver's license, but it does not and should not confer citizenship.","There are thousands of Ten Commandments plaques or monuments all over the country, and lawsuits to remove them have popped up in more than a dozen states.","Birth on U.S. territory has never been an absolute claim to citizenship.","The United States is a giant island of freedom, achievement, wealth and prosperity in a world hostile to our values.","In politics, it's more fun to win than it is to lose.","The feminist movement is not about success for women. It is about treating women as victims and about telling women that you can't succeed because society is unfair to you, and I think that's a very unfortunate idea to put in the minds of young women because I believe women can do whatever they want.","I believe that the worst thing the liberals did in this country was the Lyndon Johnson welfare system, which broke up millions of marriages by funneling taxpayers' money solely to the woman. That made the father and husband irrelevant.","One of the favorite tricks of the Democrats is to try to get the Republicans to pass over their strongest candidate and nominate instead a candidate who will be easy to beat.","Highly placed New York kingmakers work toward 'convergence' between the Republican and Democratic parties so as to preserve their 'America Last' foreign policy and eliminate foreign policy from political campaigns.","What you learn from my life is, first of all, that anybody can be a leader. You can be a leader. I wasn't born that way - I developed it, I worked at it. And also that the grassroots can organize and take on all the powers that be and defeat them. That is the lesson.","I think the Con-Con issue is really diversionary. I've always been against Con-Con, from the very first the time the idea was raised. Everybody knows that.","I simply didn't believe we needed a constitutional amendment to protect women's rights. I knew of only one law that was discriminatory toward women, a law in North Dakota stipulating that a wife had to have her husband's permission to make wine.","American women are so fortunate. When I got married, all I wanted in the world was a dryer so I didn't have to hang up my diapers. And now women have paper diapers and all sorts of conveniences in the home. And it is the man and the technology that has made the home such a pleasant place for women to be.","My college degree is from a great university in 1944. I got my master's at Harvard graduate school, completely co-ed, in 1945. My mother got her college degree in 1920. What's the problem? Those opportunities were always there for women.","The media has bought into the whole social revolution, the Kinsey ideas, and has been completely taken over by the feminists. And the feminists, I think, are the most destructive elements in our society.","I don't think the GOP is going to die; I think Trump is going to revive it.","A country isn't sovereign if we can't control who comes in and who's allowed to come in.","We need a new leader in Congress who will represent the issues that Donald Trump ran on because they were the winning issues.","Obviously, Paul Ryan is not an 'America first' guy.","You can't be an American if you don't speak English. Our public schools should be mandated to teach all children in English.","The purpose of our military is to field the finest troops possible to defend our nation and win wars.","While women prefer to have a higher-earning partner, men generally prefer to be the higher-earning partner in a relationship.","Long ago when I went to college, campuses were about 70 percent male, and until 1970, it was still nearly 60 percent.","Boys are more likely than girls to look at the cost-benefit tradeoff of going to college. The imbalance of far more women than men at colleges has been a factor in the various sex scandals that have made news in the last couple of years."],"Phyllis Smith":["Just go for it. Don't be afraid of trying new things. You have absolutely no idea what's going to present itself to you. Don't be frightened. Just buckle down and do whatever your heart desires.","If you look at the character of Sadness, they really nailed my eyebrows.","I didn't want Sadness to be just one note.","I feel like I'm an ordinary person, but I've had extraordinary opportunities in my later life, and I never saw any of it coming. I never saw 'The Office' coming, I never saw 'Inside Out' coming, and I just feel grateful and thankful to have these opportunities and to have an actual real enthusiasm in my life.","I have always been more of a joyous person than a sad person. But I was fortunate to have a mom and dad where my mom could look at my face and know what was going on and was able to get me to talk and draw it out. As a result, I didn't have to hide an emotion. I didn't have to worry about her telling me, 'That's silly.'","I'm just a normal person, believe me.","Life is not all a bowl of cherries. There are days when you aren't going to feel up to par. And it's healthy to see it in yourself and to ask, 'Hey, what's going on?'","Everybody wants to shine a little bit, even a wallflower.","I know how difficult it is to get one job, much less an entirely new career. I'm very blessed and grateful. It's like I'm a normal person with an extraordinary journey.","Well, I think that in every character there are little bits and pieces of yourself.","As a dancer, one of my many teachers along the way made the comment that who I was onstage and who I was off were two totally different people.","In my heart, my first desire was to be a dancer. I always wanted to dance and I danced from the time I was 7 till I was well into my 30s.","IMDB's not the most accurate. Even my birth place and my age are wrong there.","When I was little, my mom would dress me up and take me downtown on the Carondelet bus, which in itself was exciting. We would go to see Santa Claus at Famous-Barr. The decorations were so pretty. The line was long, but that just gave me more time to enjoy Santa's Toyland. I loved every minute of it.","God truly had a better plan for me than I had imagined. You never know what life has in store.","One day, I was taken into a room with 25 animators, all working on Sadness. They asked me a lot of questions, and they got something of the way I move into the character.","Generally, I'm not sad. I mean, everyone has sad moments.","We're not whole people if we're just one emotion. On any given day, you can be happy, sad, angry, and so on... As you mature, you just learn to deal with each one of those emotions.","I do like comedy and drama.","I grew up when Disney was doing movies like Cinderella, and all the girls were princesses.","Hopefully, 'Inside Out' will have the longevity that those older movies have, and many years down the line, people will be able to watch it and find some kinship with it.","My love for dance was so strong.","If I wasn't going to be able to dance professionally, I wasn't going to dance. That's my all-or nothing personality coming out.","The discipline as a dancer carried over into my life.","Everybody involved in Pixar, I've not met one person who's not incredibly creative and nice and lovely and know what they're doing.","I'm not accomplished enough to over-analyze something, because I don't have the background as far as people who write and know how to break down a character or story and stuff. I mostly go by gut instincts.","When I was in casting, we would bring somebody in, have them read their lines, maybe give them a few pointers, and hire them, and then once they go to the set and you have a director who's directing them, that performance may not be anywhere near what you had in the audition, either good or bad.","For me, I want to find the truth in the word and the character and the line.","One of the first places I was ever recognized after 'The Office' came out was at Target in Los Angeles. Someone came up to me, and she said, 'Are you Phyllis from 'The Office?'' We were in different aisles, but she had recognized my voice.","I've just tried to be a responsible person and pay my bills. But whatever it is I do, I want to do the best I can.","I know how difficult it is for actors to get work, because I did casting for all those years.","I'm generally pretty happy about life.","I just wanted Sadness to be true, to come from a real place. I tried to work from the inside out, going from my gut all the time. I didn't over-analyze it. I just did it.","When we were doing 'The Office,' there was an area backstage where they worked on hair and makeup, and I was sitting there waiting to get ready to go on, and one of the writers went, 'I want you to audition for 'Bad Teacher.'' I went, 'Okay!'","Even before 'The OA,' I was a very spiritual person.","I believe in angels.","I've had an experience that... I don't know the right label to put to it, if it was an angel or Jesus or what. Nobody knows anything for sure about that, but I know that I had an encounter, and I know that things exist beyond this realm, most definitely. I'm grounded in that.","I don't really think about being pigeonholed so much.","I did ballet, tap, jazz, modern, I taught dance here in my hometown of St. Louis.","When I hurt my knee, I knew it was time to retire from dancing, and I needed a job just to pay the bills, and I ended up as a receptionist for about three-four years.","I find myself dancing in the grocery store.","I know I'm not supposed to talk about God and stuff, but my spiritual life is very strong, and I really feel that a big part of whatever success I'm having is due to that as well.","I wish I had paid more attention in my psych class in college. I would've had a broader vocabulary to draw from.","It was only after I'd had some injuries that I basically retired from the performing side of show business and then began working in casting. I did that for 19 years or so before a friend of mine decided to cast me as Phyllis Lapin-Vance on 'The Office.'","You have to understand that when you're a voice actor on an animated film, you're really just a tiny little piece of this huge process. And when you finally get to see the finished product and see all of the wonderful work that the animators & the designers & the writers did to make your character stand out, it's just so touching, so humbling.","I had one young man tell me he wished I was his mom. Another young woman told me that every time she watched 'The Office,' I reminded her of her mother, who had just passed away a year ago, and that every time she saw me she felt as if she had a piece of her mom still with her.","I have said in many interviews that God had a better plan for me than I ever anticipated. I still firmly believe that, and I am grateful for a prayer answered.","I once prayed when struggling financially and worried how I was going to be able to assist my parents in their latter years living thousands of miles away, to help me win the lottery or something. And I did win the lottery, just in a different and better way.","I used to watch, on television on Sunday nights, they had the Disney hour then and the castle coming up and 'When you wish upon a star... ' That was my very first Disney memory.","To be in a Pixar movie is just great to begin with, and it has afforded me the opportunity to do a different medium because I have never done voice-over before. And I love it.","I had a really fantastic time shooting 'Bad Teacher.' I loved every second of it.","We all have these emotions, but you never really want to own up to sadness. You want to bury it.","My family in St. Louis brings me to my roots.","When I'm home, I go back to the same routine that I've had since I was a kid.","Listen, if there's anything we need more of in this world, it's something that has a better ending or is more positive.","Sadness is a necessary emotion. It's maybe not the most pleasant one to have, but it's cathartic.","I want to do the best and be the best at what I do.","We are made up of multiple emotions. And it would be unnatural to completely eliminate even one or two or three of those. It's impossible. You'd become a robot if the emotions weren't there.","In today's world, everyone's so clued into their iPhones, and communication is going by the wayside as far as one-on-one is concerned. It's very seldom that I walk into a room and parents make their children say hello and have a social grace with one another."],"Phyllis Theroux":["Mistakes are the usual bridge between inexperience and wisdom.","I think this is what hooks one to gardening: it is the closest one can come to being present at creation.","To send a letter is a good way to go somewhere without moving anything but your heart."],"Pia Toscano":["My favorite type of music to sing is definitely those big ballads, I just love doing those power ballads.","If my life was a song the title would probably be 'Clumsy', 'cause I'm clumsy.","I don't sing in the shower at all, and I don't sing in the shower, either.","For the live shows, I'm just getting my song together. I go back to my hotel room and I just listen to my song over and over again, figure out how to make it different and put my little Pia spin on it.","When I first found out that I was an Idol finalist, I cried tears of happiness. I was just so happy, and my family was there and the fact that got to see that moment and share that moment with me was just everything to me.","This has been my dream since I was a little girl. I've worked so hard for this moment, and its finally coming true and I couldn't be more happy.","When I walk out on that stage, I just want America to know, that this is what I'm supposed to do. This is my dream.","I just want to make everybody feel what I'm singing. And just to relate to me and know that this has been dream since I was a little girl. I've worked so hard for this, and I just want them to connect with me.","You don't know for sure why things happen, but you know, it did! It was my time to go on the show and I'm excited to see what my future holds.","I'd like to do a pop album with an R and B influence. I definitely want to have those big ballads with the uptempo hits as well.","I truly don't know why the boys are getting all the votes - it could be because they are really amazing, and that's all there is to it. They're really, really good and every single boy deserves to be in the competition right now, and so do the two girls.","I'm definitely doing better. I never realized that I would get the support that I've gotten from everybody - from my fans, to people that I've idolized my whole life. So it's overwhelming, it's amazing and I believe that everything happens for a reason so I'm in a really good place right now."],"Pia Zadora":["The reason we shot it was that the script was geared to Las Vegas and it was something commercial that we wanted to have in the can in case Butterfly was a success and we needed a follow-up.","If you have a guy like Jermaine, it's a pain in the neck. When we were on the road together in Europe, Jesus, I had to kick the girls off of him. I mean, they throw themselves on the floor and take off their hats.","I have a funny name.","I actually started singing those songs six or seven years ago, when I was an opening act for Frank Sinatra.","Then I went through a whole bunch of crap with my lousy movies and pop records. I had people behind me kind of steering me in that direction, but it wasn't really my bag.","You know, it was important for me to do something like that, because nobody ever really thought I could do anything except look sexy on a poster and go shopping.","When I was 21 I stopped and got married. I tried for a while to be the perfect wife, society this, society that but it wasn't working, so after about a year I went back to work.","I'm just not comfortable with that society stuff. I mean, we were just invited to the White House, but my husband won't take me because he knows I don't want to go.","A lot of straight people think I'm nuts.","I don't consider myself a sex symbol.","The thing you do is escape from them by immersing myself in the character you're playing.","I'm gonna give them the advice that I always took myself, that it's better to get to know somebody before you jump into the sack with them. Because then if you jump into the sack and fall in love, and you liked them already, you're home free.","I love John Waters. You see, I want to be the next Divine.","And I like the way Cain writes his women. Very strong. They're kind of lusty, they know what they want, they're full of conviction. Cain's women are sexual.","Basically, I'm a romantic.","I don't like to go to the movies to see violence or some kind of spy thing with all kinds of information you have to assimilate to understand the plot.","I like to see love stories: romantic comedy or romantic drama.","Butterfly was certainly a vehicle for me, and if it died, it still would have served its purpose, in spades. We never expected it to give me the visibility it has given me. It was just a small thing as a vehicle, and suddenly the whole world knew about it.","You know, it's not the people in Hollywood who go to see movies that will make a movie successful; it's the people all around the country; it's word-of-mouth.","But there's not enough time in life to go sit at a party, have a drink, and make idle conversation. There's too many important things to do. Just being together with my husband, spending time alone, which I have very little of.","The future comes quickly. Before you know it, you turn around and it's tomorrow.","In a way, my past gives me a little credibility. Not that anybody cares what I did nineteen years ago, but I did have a career, and a legitimate one, before I met my husband.","Film, I think, is my medium.","I'm one Pia Zadora, the same way all the time. That's why I'm happy. It took me a long time to get to the point where could be myself all the time."],"Picabo Street":["My brother and Lauren are very close with me and they are in Sun Valley, so sometimes I need to go there and feel their presence. And there are times I need to see my bro' alone.","I'm not following anybody's tracks, I'm making my own baby.","I have my gold forever and no one can ever take it away from me.","There were mornings when I just didn't want to get out of bed. But once again, I'm in an adverse situation and having to deal with something new and learn how to do it.","I've made a promise to myself to be a 100% healthy person if nothing else.","Nobody needs to prove to anybody what they're worthy of, just the person that they look at in the mirror. That's the only person you need to answer to.","My knee is as strong as it was before, if not stronger, and it's a matter of getting my leg strong. I lost six years of strength in about six month's time, so it's going to take another year or two to get that leg back up to full strength, but I'm good to go so far.","I'm hoping that maybe everyone on the Olympic team thinks that I'm worthy to carry the flag. That's my next goal, to carry the flag during the opening ceremonies, if everyone chooses me.","I wasn't losing my focus but I was getting tired of focusing. What I was focusing on was becoming too routine, too ritual, not something that was interesting, new and exciting.","Here at the house, I've been decorating it and getting it organized. My best friend moved in in October so I've been getting her settled. She's my personal assistant now.","I don't know if it's just me or everyone, but the whole vibe with skiing is not so much thriving on competition against others as it is against myself and the clock.","I don't look at it like that's my rival and I have to beat her. It's more like, I have to ski this as fast as I can and the fastest of everyone out here and that's what I expect.","Every once in a while I run the Olympic downhill in Japan in my head. I think of how the energy is going to flow and then I make it all work for myself.","I get my inspiration from everyone when I need it and how I need it.","There are times everyone needs to be together for me and we all just work together; making sure that my energy is good and right when I go do what I'm going to do. That means the family needs to spend time together.","It is an everlasting desire to make my dreams come true. And it's getting to the point now where it's like, come on I want my dreams to come true so that I can get on with the rest of my life. Sometimes I think about the rest of my life when I'm done.","A lot of women don't know how to vent and deal with emotions.","I donate money to the existing foundation that funds the US Ski Team kids.","One of my dreams in life is to do fund-raising for the youth.","The whole image thing gets in the way. Then there are the guys that it excites them and it's what draws them to me. But I don't know whether they would care for me if I didn't have this image.","I'm social and I meet people and talk to people but I'm not looking for the ideal person to fit my mold and to raise my family with yet. I'm just kind of doing my thing and learning from the people I'm around and who I cross paths with.","That fat speed that I love, that sensation, that's what I want.","I'm looking forward to free skiing the most. Just groomers, big wide groomers making nice big turns.","I want kids to have a chance to dream of becoming something like I did in my life, and when you're living in a home that's dysfunctional and unhealthy that way, you don't dream like that.","But to personally satisfy my own adrenalin needs, I've been racing cars a little bit, which has been fun.","We weren't built to fly. We can do it, but we shouldn't be surprised if it feels a little unnatural."],"Pico Iyer":["A traveler is really not someone who crosses ground so much as someone who is always hungry for the next challenge and adventure.","Nearly everybody I know does something to try to remove herself to clear her head and to have enough time and space to think... All of us instinctively feel that something inside us is crying out for more spaciousness and stillness to offset the exhilarations of this movement and the fun and diversion of the modern world.","It's no coincidence that the word 'holiday' suggests a holy day, or that the longest book in the Torah concerns the Sabbath. If you wish to advance in any sphere, the best way is to take a retreat.","Where you come from now is much less important than where you're going. More and more of us are rooted in the future or the present tense as much as in the past. And home, we know, is not just the place where you happen to be born. It's the place where you become yourself.","Alas, those six unfortunate souls who have made their way through my books know that every one of them is about Emerson and Thoreau and their dark counters, Melville and Emily Dickinson. Try as I might, I can't get their inspirations, their challenges and sentences and wisdom and questions out of my head.","We can't change the world except insofar as we change the way we look at the world - and, in fact, any one of us can make that change, in any direction, at any moment.","Like any traveler, I'm always looking for those experiences that are almost unique to any place, and watching films around Alaska of the skies in winter made me want to taste those unworldly showers of light in person.","You need to rebel to see the other options and to get a much richer, fuller sense of the world. And it's only once you've worked through that and seen through that that you can come back and accept who you are. You have to try all the other options.","In the past, I've visited remote places - North Korea, Ethiopia, Easter Island - partly as a way to visit remote states of mind: remote parts of myself that I wouldn't ordinarily explore.","For centuries, Cuba's greatest resource has been its people.","Travel for me is all about transformation, and I'm fascinated by those people who really do come back from a trip unrecognizable to themselves and perhaps open to the same possibilities they'd have written off not a month before.","I think it's in human nature to want to have more, to compete with the other and, at some level, to be dissatisfied if someone else has more than you.","We readily go to the health club when our doctor suggests we need more exercise, but we regularly neglect the 'mental health club' that our well-being more truly requires.","What I treasure most at any moment is intimacy, surprise, a sense of mystery, wit, depth and love. A handful of cherished friends offer me this, and the occasional singer or film-maker or artist. But my most reliable sources of electricity are Henry David Thoreau, Shakespeare, Melville and Emily Dickinson.","Almost everybody I know has this sense of overdosing on information and getting dizzy living at post-human speeds.","I would never call Jerusalem beautiful or comfortable or consoling. But there's something about it that you can't turn away from.","It takes 25 minutes to recover from a phone call or an e-mail, researchers have found, and yet the average person receives such an interruption every 11 minutes. Which means that we're never caught up; we're always out of breath, running behind.","I've never meditated in my life. I don't practice yoga nor any religion. I'm a tourist on the realm of stillness.","I'm very happy to be a foreigner in Japan, and I can't think of a more wonderful place to live, but at the same time, I would never want to be Japanese, because they are subject to stresses that I am not.","In many a piece of music, it's the pause or the rest that gives the piece its beauty and its shape. And I know I, as a writer, will often try to include a lot of empty space on the page so that the reader can complete my thoughts and sentences and so that her imagination has room to breathe.","Movement is a fantastic privilege... but it ultimately only has meaning if you have a home to go back to.","Hello Kitty will never speak.","In the two-room flat where I live in Japan, I try to take time every day to step away from the bombardment of e-mails and opportunities and papers around my desk, for an hour, and just sit on our 30-inch terrace in the sun, reading something sustaining, whether 'The Age of Innocence' or the latest by Colm Toibin.","The more ways we have to connect, the more many of us seem desperate to unplug.","Writing is how I find out what I believe and what I care most deeply about. It's how I sort through the mess of daily experience and try to make sense of it - by stepping out of it for a while. Writing is how I train a searchlight into the darker corners of my self and the world, as I'm sure I'd never do otherwise.","Travel, for me, is a little bit like being in love because suddenly, all your senses are at the setting marked 'on.' Suddenly, you're alert to the secret patterns of the world.","'Globalization' has become the great tag phrase, but when we talk about it, it's nearly always in terms of the global marketplace or communications technology - either data or goods that are whizzing around. We forget that people are whizzing around more and more. On them, it takes a toll.","Places have charisma, in short, as much as people do.","If we do away with semi-colons, parentheses and much else, we will lose all music, nuance and subtlety in communication - and end up shouting at one another in block capitals.","Something in us is telling us we're moving too fast, at a pace dictated by machines rather than by anything human, and that unless we take conscious measures, we'll permanently be out of breath.","There are literally Internet rescue camps in China and Korea to deal with children that are addicted. Internet disorder is maybe going to count as a psychiatric disorder in a couple of years.","If we want to talk about Gross Natural Product, we have to talk about the King of Bhutan's index of Gross National Happiness, too. Certainly I have found, as many travellers before me, that people in the poorest places are often the readiest to shower me, from an affluent country, with hospitality and kindness.","For more and more of us, home has really less to do with a piece of soil than, you could say, with a piece of soul. If somebody suddenly asks me, 'Where's your home?' I think about my sweetheart or my closest friends or the songs that travel with me wherever I happen to be.","I write - though perhaps it sounds pretentious to say so - to make a clearing in the wilderness, to find out what I care about and what exactly to make of it.","Older boys were allowed to beat younger ones at my 15th-century English boarding school, and every boy had to run a five-mile annual steeplechase through the sludge and rain of an October day, as horses do. We wrote poems in dead languages and recited the Lord's Prayer in Latin every Sunday night.","American dreams are strongest in the hearts of those who have seen America only in their dreams.","The average American teenager sends or receives 75 text messages a day, though one girl in Sacramento managed to handle an average of 10,000 every 24 hours for a month.","We have more and more ways to communicate, as Thoreau noted, but less and less to say.","The central paradox of the machines that have made our lives so much brighter, quicker, longer and healthier is that they cannot teach us how to make the best use of them; the information revolution came without an instruction manual.","My Christmas present to myself each year is to see how much air travel can open up the world and take me to places as far from sheltered California and Japan as possible.","A holy day, after all, is a day for considering everything you otherwise think too little about.","When we are kids, we imagine that to define ourselves or to find ourselves means charting your own individuality, making your own destiny, and actually running away from your parents and your home and what you grew up with. Of course, as the years go on, we come to find that we become our parents.","I think writing is really about a journey of understanding. So you take something that seems very far away, and the more you write about it, the more you travel into it, and you see it from within.","You can only make sense of the online world by going offline and by getting the wisdom and emotional clarity to know how to make the best use of the Internet.","I think at this point I only write books about questions I really want to figure out. They're indulgences, essentially. I think, 'What would I like to spend five years really thinking about? What could I gain from thinking about for five years?'","Certainly, I think Canada is many years ahead of the curve and still the great global pioneer.","To see the Persia of poets and painters, hiding in plain sight behind the much-maligned Iran of our newspaper headlines, would be my fondest wish.","The first time I stepped onto the rooftop of the Potala Palace in Lhasa in 1985, I felt, as never before or since, as if I was stepping onto the rooftop of my being: onto some dimension of consciousness that I'd never visited before.","People are always asking me where I come from, and they're expecting me to say India, and they're absolutely right insofar as 100 percent of my blood and ancestry does come from India. Except, I've never lived one day of my life there. I can't speak even one word of its more than 22,000 dialects.","One of the happier ironies of recent history is that even as Tibet is being wiped off the map in Tibet itself, here it is in California, in Switzerland, in Japan. All over the world, Tibetan Buddhism is now part of the neighborhood. In 1968, there were two Tibetan Buddhist centers in the West. By 2000, there were 40 in New York alone.","I sometimes think that so much of our life takes place inside our heads - in memory or imagination or interpretation or speculation - that if I really want to change my life, I might best begin by changing my mind.","Wherever we are, any time of night or day, our bosses, junk-mailers, our parents can get to us. Sociologists have actually found that in recent years Americans are working fewer hours than 50 years ago, but we feel as if we're working more. We have more and more time-saving devices, but sometimes, it seems, less and less time.","The one thing perhaps that technology hasn't always given us is a sense of how to make the wisest use of technology.","I think one reason, obviously, that I spend so much time in one place is that I've been lucky enough to travel a lot, and now there are other different, invisible trains that are more interesting to me.","In Japan, I live in a little neighborhood in the middle of nowhere. I don't have a bicycle or a car or anything, so my only movement is within the boundaries of my feet. I feel there's a need for that kind of conscientious objection to the momentum of the world.","We all know how we can be turned around by a magic place; that's why we travel, often. And yet we all know, too, that the change cannot be guaranteed. Travel is a fool's paradise, Emerson reminded us, if we think that we can find anything far off that we could not find at home.","In barely one generation, we've moved from exulting in the time-saving devices that have so expanded our lives to trying to get away from them - often in order to make more time. The more ways we have to connect, the more many of us seem desperate to unplug.","Like teenagers, we appear to have gone from knowing nothing about the world to knowing too much all but overnight.","I've yet to use a cellphone, and I've never tweeted or entered Facebook. I try not to go online till my day's writing is finished, and I moved from Manhattan to rural Japan in part so I could more easily survive for long stretches entirely on foot, and every trip to the movies would be an event.","To me, part of the beauty of a comma is that it offers a rest, like one in music: a break that gives the whole piece of music greater shape, deeper harmony. It allows us to catch our breath.","Contractions, 'U' for 'you' and the like are wonderful to make communication brief and efficient - but we wouldn't want all our talk to be only brief and efficient. Taking pauses out of language would be like taking the net away from a tennis game. Where would all the fun go?","It's an old principle, as old as the Buddha or Marcus Aurelius: We need at times to step away from our lives in order to put them in perspective. Especially if we wish to be productive.","All of us are feeling scattered and distracted as we try to keep up with an accelerating world. But nearly all of us have an answer in our hands, in simply choosing to do nothing and go nowhere for a while.","In Vancouver, in Sydney and in Orange County, we live among fluorescent stores and streets so brightly lit that you can read a book after dark; in other places across our global body, there are blackouts and curfews every night.","A single Dallas Cowboys football game uses up as much electricity as the entire nation of Liberia in those same three hours - one reason the globe, if looked at from a certain height, is a cluster of lights surrounded by enormous patches of dark.","Home is, in the end, not just the place where you sleep, but the place where you stand.","I can still remember the afternoon, on my 15th birthday, when I opened up 'The Virgin and the Gypsy,' D.H. Lawrence's novella, in my tiny cell in boarding school, and whole worlds of possibility opened out that I had never guessed existed. The language was on fire and sang of liberation.","A book doesn't have to be a literary classic, of course, to change us forever.","The less you struggle with a problem, the more it's likely to solve itself. The less time you spend frantically running around, the more productive you are likely to be.","More and more of us feel like emergency-room physicians, permanently on call, required to heal ourselves but unable to find the prescription for all the clutter on our desk.","It's only by taking myself away from clutter and distraction that I can begin to hear something out of earshot and recall that listening is much more invigorating than giving voice to all the thoughts and prejudices that anyway keep me company twenty-four hours a day.","It takes courage, of course, to step out of the fray, as it takes courage to do anything that's necessary, whether tending to a loved one on her deathbed or turning away from that sugarcoated doughnut.","Though I knew that poverty certainly didn't buy happiness, I wasn't convinced that money did, either.","I'm no Buddhist monk, and I can't say I'm in love with renunciation in itself, or traveling an hour or more to print out an article I've written, or missing out on the N.B.A. Finals. But at some point, I decided that, for me at least, happiness arose out of all I didn't want or need, not all I did.","Not having a car gives me volumes not to think or worry about, and makes walks around the neighborhood a daily adventure.","I remember how, in the corporate world, I always knew there was some higher position I could attain, which meant that, like Zeno's arrow, I was guaranteed never to arrive and always to remain dissatisfied.","I think the world is always going to be as diverse as it always has been.","The recipe to an unhappy life in Japan is to want to be Japanese if you are not. Anyone who wants to penetrate the country is setting themselves up for tears and disappointment.","Japan functions on the basis of everyone sharing certain assumptions, where each person knows his part in a larger whole. The foreigner sits outside and is threatening. If he comes in, that's the most threatening of all.","A writer is a palmist, reading the lines of the planet.","The power of affinity lies in its mystery: the way it stands outside everything logical; you step into a crowded room and see a stranger, and somehow you feel you know her better than you know the friends you came with.","I couldn't follow the events of September 11 because I was proofreading a novel I'd just completed - on Islam and its quarrel with the West - that I'd promised, six months earlier, to deliver to my editor on September 12, 2001.","Writing reminds you of how much there is in your life that stands outside your explanations. In that way, it's almost a journey into faith and doubt at once.","Abjure all accretions and turn off the lights. Put on some music - Leonard Cohen, say, perhaps his 'Various Positions' - and let your mind cool down. Soon you'll forget there's a word called 'stress.'","I think of myself as living so much outside borders or old categories that I choose as my leaders U2, the Dalai Lama, Vaclav Havel, Sigur Ros, Desmond Tutu, Barack Obama, and the girl next door. By definition, in short, my leaders are the ones who think in terms larger, and more intimate, than any country.","If I was a parent or a kid, I would need a cell phone, and those things are invaluable, but my kids are out of the house now, and I am thrilled when I wake up to not have a cell phone, and feel like today is stretching out in front of me for 1,000 hours, as it seems.","I suppose even when I was growing up, I noticed I was most happy when I was absorbed in something, lost in the moment and forgot the time, whether was conversation, movie, or a game I was playing. That was my definition of happiness. And I was least happy when I was all over the place, distracted and restless.","In financial terms, my sense is that the distribution of wealth, unequal as it is, is self-perpetuating, and, especially in a linked and accelerating world, the rich get ever more quickly richer while the poor get ever more speedily poorer.","The poverty one still sees in America today is more shocking to me than anything I have seen in Ethiopia or Calcutta or Manila, and has made me, as someone living in a society of great wealth and someone who's never had to worry about the next meal, think seriously about what universal responsibility really means."],"Pier Luigi Bersani":["The next adventure is the government, a government of change.","I reiterate that the rigor and credibility brought to the world by Monti's government are for us a point of no return."],"Pier Luigi Loro Piana":["Sailing is in the same vein as horse riding. There's a beauty to it; it's an elegant sport. You have to employ your intelligence. It's technical, but you also have to take into account the natural elements - the wind, the water, the weather.","The Australians have a scientific approach and a very strong professionalism, a passion to do the best. Theirs is the best wool. And Loro Piana wants the best.","Being at a very high quality level was the only way for us to survive.","A vicuna alive is worth more than one dead. Now it is like a goldmine.","The best sheep breeders are in Australia and New Zealand.","Our customers are quality maniacs.","Our philosophy is always to search for the best quality. That is something our father taught us. It's one way to be different from your competitors. You can try to be cheaper, or you can try to be better.","The life of a business is not like a football team! We are not taking part in an Italy-France game or against Germany.","I don't think LVMH will want to significantly change the strategy of Loro Piana, and I don't think that they would have bought it otherwise.","Quality will save our company.","You don't have to make things which are just expensive.","Loro Piana is all about seeking quality materials.","When we started, there was lots of formalwear made with quality fabrics, but Loro Piana's innovation was to use these in casualwear, too.","I never expect business to be easy.","My family have been wool merchants since the 19th century. My first job, aged 18, was buying fabric from my father to produce and sell ties. But I was also at university in Milan.","We are very far from our potential, but you aren't going to see 500 stores; that wouldn't be consistent with the exclusivity of our brand. You also aren't going to see a Loro Piana perfume, glasses, or watches, because we are concentrating on our core business.","We check everything to make sure it is pure and of the highest quality. There is good wine and bad wine; we buy only the good wine.","My father passed me the concept that vicuna was something very special, very expensive. So it was a question of pride. I didn't want anybody else in the world to be touching vicuna before us.","My brother and I became convinced that to buy and sell legally sheared vicuna hair was the only way to help the vicuna increase in numbers. If the animal becomes useful to society, people will take care of the animal; if it's not useful, they will not take care.","Dealing with political things, it's not for me. It makes me crazy. I want to buy, you want to sell. Please make it simple.","People from the country are very simple and loyal. I like that. I prefer to deal with the campesinos rather than the political people in Lima.","I'm always on a quest to find the next best natural fiber.","Our farmers have become family.","So many young designers are focused on styling rather than materials now. We have to change that.","The Loro Piana man is a very active one: he works hard, and when he has time off, being close to nature is important to him.","Luxury is research in quality. It's quality with no compromise. What does that mean? That you don't think about how much something will cost to be able to achieve the very, very best.","Once you start compromising, once you start trying to keep cost lower, this is not luxury. Luxury is wanting the best and using the best materials with which to do that."],"Pier Paolo Pasolini":["Once life is finished it acquires a sense; up to that point it has not got a sense; its sense is suspended and therefore ambiguous.","Death does determine life."],"Pierce Brosnan":["Love means that everything is right with the world. Love and only love. Love means that you are content within your own heart and in the presence of the person that you love, who fills your day and makes you stronger and wiser, and gives you the confidence to go out into the world. Love is just the most beautiful, joyous feeling.","You can get totally messed up trying to please everyone with what you do, but ultimately, you have to please yourself.","Together we are stronger, our voices louder, and the synergy of our actions more powerful. Together we can prevail on the Navy to put commonsense safeguards in place, like requiring its ships to avoid the most sensitive marine mammal habitats and to stop their training exercises during peak migrations.","It's the ultimate goal every day you wake up, to be happy. At the end of the week, you want to be happy. Happy in love, happy in work, happy in life, happy with yourself. It's pretty simple.","I like dressing in all seasons. Every season has its own character and charm.","I realise how precious life is, probably because I've seen how it can be taken away.","I've been identified with James Bond or Thomas Crown for so long; suave, elegant, sophisticated men in suits. it's like you've been giving the same performance for 20 years.","Cancer is the most pernicious, insidious, disgusting disease of life.","My family is my sanctuary.","I'm one of those guys who believes that you need a strong woman in your life.","I think you make the best with what you've got, you know? Sometimes you have very little. And you just always try to rise to higher ground, because you're going to suffer one way or the other, so you just hope that you have strength and perseverance and good friends and faith, some kind of faith, to endure and move on to greener pastures.","We owe it to our children to be better stewards of the environment. The alternative? - a world without whales. It's too terrible to imagine.","I love the ukulele. It's got a beautiful, melodic tone to it. There's something innocent and romantic, and it's just a grand instrument to play.","When it comes to whaling, Iceland is an international outlaw. Years of global negotiations and declarations have failed utterly to end its illegal slaughter of whales. It's time to send Iceland a message it can't ignore: trade sanctions.","It always helps to have a bit of prayer in your back pocket. At the end of the day, you have to have something, and for me, that is God, Jesus, my Catholic upbringing, my faith.","I have some wonderful suits in my closet, a lovely car, some refined watches.","When people don't believe in you, you have to believe in yourself.","Oh, humiliation is poisonous. It's one of the deepest pains of being human.","People should be allowed to marry, and gay marriage should be out there. If a man or a woman has a good partner and they love each other with their heart and soul, let them marry. I am very much for gay marriage.","You get tangled up in your own ego of how you're perceived. You can lose your way.","My religious philosophy is kindness. Try to be kind. That's something worth achieving.","Be good to people, be kind to people, show up, read the lines, hit the mark, and go home.","I think Indian women are very beautiful. They have a sense of elegance and innocence.","Must whales and dolphins be subjected to deafening noise that will cause more than 3.5 million instances of temporary and/or permanent hearing loss? For species that depend on hearing for survival - to find food, migrate, and communicate - any hearing loss could be catastrophic. As one scientist noted, a deaf whale is a dead whale.","No one can escape life's pain. That's life.","Sometimes, I wonder where my place in this town called 'Hollywood' is - and that can give you a really dull headache.","The word 'star' doesn't mean an awful lot to me. 'Good actor' and having the respect of one's peers means more.","I left school at 15 feeling fairly useless and not really up to scratch in my education. And I still suffer sometimes from that lack of education.","As I've gotten older and I've watched people in productions, I go to the theater when I go back to London and see friends in Broadway, I think maybe there might come a time here to get back up there and prove oneself. It's just an itch; it's a nagging itch to go back there.","There will be time enough some day to work less.","It's good to like yourself, and that only comes from hard work, from doing. But vanity is dangerous; it can trip you badly.","James Bond is one of those heroes that all guys feel they could actually be like.","I was aware that I was not getting the good acting roles because I was either too handsome, too pretty or whatever. I was being judged in ways that left me nowhere to go. You have to be patient.","You always bump into politics in life, and as a man, I'm party to a number of environmental issues that concern me first and foremost, as a man, as a father.","I think that genetically we're programmed to battle each other.","I paint landscapes, figuratives. I painted all my life. In fact, I started as a commercial artist.","If I got into a fight in a bar, I'd miss the dude by miles. I wouldn't know how to connect. It would be a comedy.","You're always going to have to prove yourself, because acting is such a capricious game.","Cancer is a very sad thing, but you can always take something from every experience.","I enjoy the company of my fellow man and woman, and I do not wish to be sequestered away in any type of bubble.","I've been a married man most of my life; that's the way I like it.","Clive Owen would be a fantastic James Bond. Any man who does it will have to weigh his odds - whether he can get in and get out.","This man called President Bush has a lot to answer for. I don't know if this man is really taking care of America. This government has been shameful.","Someone like Roman Polanski comes with a lifetime of achievement, cinematically.","Acting allows me to explore new worlds, to discover characters by delving into their lives, and ultimately to become someone else entirely.","For me, acting is doing.","I don't see myself as the Hunk of the Month.","I had to have some balls to be Irish Catholic in South London. Most of that time I spent fighting.","My mother was the prettiest woman in the town. He was a bit older than her. They made me. And he split.","Some people have a tendency to get knocked down in this business and sulk and whine, and they just create a rod for their back, really. You have to have broad shoulders and get through it.","There's too many people in seats of power who just haven't got a clue what they're doing. They're bean counters, and it just pisses me off because consequently our kids go to see crap movies.","Dark comedy is very difficult. You have to bring the audience in and push them away at the same time.","It never felt real to me. I never felt I had complete ownership over Bond. Because you'd have these stupid one-liners - which I loathed - and I always felt phony doing them.","That's it. I've said all I've got to say on the world of James Bond.","I'm a journeyman actor.","I have no desire to look at myself.","He's a fantastic actor, Kelsey Grammer. You don't have that kind of career without having a talent, without having something to say and to give to an audience.","I've had my face sliced open one day. Stunt man went one way, and I went the same way and had a few stitches.","Dealing with death is there forever, really, you know, because we all have to face it.","I'm not a politician or political animal.","I went to a Radiohead concert with Mr. Aaron Paul and became instantly hip. He's a great tweeter and took a photograph of the two of us. He said, 'Man, look at this! We've already got 800 hits in five minutes!' So this old dog became hip.","Certain projects find you at the right time.","When you go through a long illness, certainly one of cancer, there's a certain release from it and relief that it has come to an end, because the suffering can be unbearable, as opposed to an abrupt stop to life when they go out the door and there's a loved one who never comes home because of some accident.","Being a widower is not that groovy when you lose someone you really love, and you have to go out and date again.","I am the actor that I am. I do what I do. I've been a 'leading man' playing romantic leads for a long time now.","When I got the invitation to be part of 'The Ghost' or 'The Ghost Writer,' as it's now known, from Mr. Roman Polanski, my interest level was very piqued. I was very excited and pleased to get such an offer from Mr. Roman Polanski.","I always see myself as a character actor, but Remington Steele was me. I gave up on trying to be any character. I just put myself as me in this world of Remington Steele and the grand pretender.","I know something about life and being a father and the worries and the fears of bringing up children.","I love George Clooney; I think George is brilliant.","If you want to do a female version of 'The Expendables,' I'll be in that one.","Acting for the Indian audience is surely on my bucket list; it may take some time, though.","Indian cinema is entertaining, and what I love most about it is the songs and dances in the films.","I'd my own insecurities while portraying the role of James Bond.","With such riches as I have in life, you're always nervous. Being Irish, you're waiting for something to knock it sideways.","I just find that you can become a very boring person living in L.A. I tell you, living there on a day-to-day basis is vacuous: terribly fake.","There are a lot of funny things that happen in one's life.","You want to believe in leaders, really believe in leaders. You want what they are saying to be truthful, and you want to trust them.","God has been good to me. My faith has been good to me in the moments of deepest suffering, doubt and fear.","Intrinsically, I'm the same person I was as a young lad, and I think I still have the optimism of life, still the same wants and desires to be good and great about what I do.","When I went to America, I spoke so much about who I was and gave so much away in a confessional, Irish, story-telling way that I suddenly realised I had given up a lot of myself. I had to shut up.","I thought 'Moulin Rouge' was inspirational, and 'Jesus Christ Superstar' I loved.","The life of an actor lends itself to emotion, and yet you have to be tough as old boots to stay at the table.","There's always been product placement in Bond movies.","I visit London several times a year. It is my home away from home.","I love New York City. The energy, the theatre, the art, the food, the people, the parks and streets. But I could say the same of London or Paris, too.","I always wanted to do a Western.","I should like to think that we'll find peace on this Earth at some point and come to a collective consciousness of compassion for each other, where we say, 'Enough! Let us live as one!'","I love the intimacy and the passion and the danger that go into independent filmmaking. Because it comes out of a creative necessity. It comes from people who really want to make a movie and want to make a difference and want to grab an audience by the gullet and show them something different.","Movies are somewhat diminished by blockbusters, which are great, but there's not enough choice.","I've been very fortunate that I've worked since I left drama school in 1976.","Barbara Broccoli was a great friend of my late wife's and continues to be someone who is very gracious with me, my family, and our life.","I like Chekov a lot.","My life started on the banks of the Boyne in County Meath. Navan is the name of the town; only me, Mom, Dad.","There was a beautiful church where I lived in Navan, taught by the Christian brothers: fierce, angry men, repressed.","My mother gave me boxing gloves; I wanted boxing gloves. I liked to box. So I still have them. They're still in my bookcase, very old, tattered, and they were cherished.","I can still run in a straight line, and I can still throw a punch.","I will forever be a Bond. It's a small group of men who've made this role. Someone said, More men have walked on the moon than have played James Bond.'","I always keep thinking, 'The next role - that's going to be the one that's really going to define me and show them all. I'll transform and disappear, and it will be a revelation.'","I love the finer things.","To be a young Irishman in London and go to the theater to see 'Rosemary's Baby'... it scared the crap out of me.","The forties are very cool and very pastoral. The fifties look like they're pastoral, and then you get a bit more turbulence.","Being a father is a huge responsibility but a satisfying one.","I try to be as disciplined as I possibly can. I try to live a fairly kind of clean life. I do yoga; I cycle and do weights and swim. I do whatever it takes.","I went and met with Tim Burton for the role of Batman. But I just couldn't really take it seriously; any man who wears his underpants outside his pants just cannot be taken seriously.","I held the generous, strong, beautiful hand of my first wife Cassie as ovarian cancer took her life much too soon.","I have said to my agents, 'I want to work. I want to play character roles.'","I hold Bond dear to my heart. I've traveled the world as an ambassador for that character, and I had a bloody great time doing it.","I use so much of myself in everything I do. I think every actor does because you have no one else to go to but yourself and your own imagination.","Action films can be like watching paint dry. You can just die in the trailer waiting for them to set up a shot, then you go out for a few minutes or an hour of endurance testing.","I'd love to do 'The Expendables.' It's just a kick in the pants.","The spy genre is something which, as a fan of movies, a movie geek myself, I just love that cinematic joy that they bring.","I was lucky enough to make four Bond films. It finished in rather shambolic fashion, but I have no bitterness, no resentment.","The fin whale is the second largest whale species on Earth, weighing up to 80 tons.","In 1981, I borrowed 2,000 pounds - a lot of money back then - paid 50 quid for a seat, packed my own sandwich, and hopped on a plane to America. It was a mighty leap, but one that paid off. A week later, I got a job called 'Remington Steele.'","I'm very confident that Nick Hornby always gets it right as a writer. He has the vernacular and passion. He is adroit and dry, and balances humor with the humanity of life.","Turning 60 had an impact on my heart and soul, I must say, because you're dealing with time: past, present, and future. You suddenly realize you've come down the road quite a ways.","I think Buddhism is a wonderful philosophy. I've had the good fortune to meet many wonderful teachers from that society.","There's a wonderful stable of directors I've worked with, and work I've done that has dignity and meaningfulness.","I'm an actor first and foremost. My producing credentials are just to say, 'Yeah, I love this story and now let's bring the people, the ensemble together,' and I get out of the way. I have no desire to check on schedules and shooting schedules and money and stuff like that.","I'm pretty tried-and-tested in the world of 'suit acting.'","I live a pretty domestic and normal life. I make my kids breakfast most mornings, but nothing too elaborate - soft-boiled eggs and oatmeal.","The scripts don't come pouring in; I have to fight for every part.","I like playing thieves.","To my eye, women get sexier around 35. They know a thing or two, and knowledge is always alluring.","Being an actor in Hollywood involves lots of things beyond acting. Charm really helps.","Love cannot burn constantly.","I love color. When I paint, I use a lot of color. I love art that has a vibrancy of color and compositions. I adore the Impressionists, and I'm influenced strongly by them as a self-taught artist.","I'd been brought up on... American TV: 'Lou Grant,' 'Starsky & Hutch;' 'Gilligan's Island.'","Once I found acting and found that I could get away with it and make a living out of it, I was thrilled.","Love is hard.","As you get older, there's a loosening of the ties to the ego and the posturing of who you are and how you behave.","The Danish filmmakers are a unique breed of filmmakers, with the Dogme films and Lars von Trier.","My wife loves Roger Moore.","Daniel Craig is brilliant as Bond: there is no question about that. But it's a different Bond. It's the cross pollination of 'The Bourne Identity' and 'James Bond;' that kind of style of filmmaking.","The films that I've made with my company Irish DreamTime are close to my heart. 'The Greatest' being one of them, and 'Evelyn' being another.","Some people think my singing is superb. But they're mainly on strong medication and not allowed out much.","I have not had any plastic surgery in any shape or form. No implants. And my hair is not dyed.","I found a great woman in Keely Shaye. Not if I searched a million times over would I find one as good.","Actors have an innate sense of self and humanity, the good ones do, and of being generous of heart and generous of spirit.","I've been accused of my publicist of being too confessional... it's probably my Celtic upbringing.","I have had a singing teacher in L.A. for many, many years just to work on my voice as an actor.","I think if Roman Polanski had asked me to do the phone book, I would have said, 'Yes.'","I was trained as an actor and taught to believe at a very young age that I could be anything and do anything, and then you find yourself painted into a corner by your own image or persona.","Susanne Bier's work I've always really enjoyed. She's just such a great filmmaker; she's very cool and very sexy - that always helps, too.","The Danes and the Irish have a great simpatico, that's for sure.","There's nothing like working with the best actors possible, and if you have a piece of material like, 'Long Way Down' or 'Love Punch,' which allows you to play, then it's just a joy to go to work.","I'm first and foremost an Irishman, by birth, by nature, by soul, but an American citizen through and through as well.","I had a theatre company years ago when I was a young man, and we would do street theater. This guy did a workshop one day on fire eating, and I participated, and it was just one of those party tricks that you learn. My last endeavor doing that was with the Muppets, back in 1995 or something like that. And I haven't done it since.","I love 'Maxim,' actually. It's very cool.","Being some country lad from the banks of the River Boyne, I never wanted to be wealthy. I was driven by artistic intention.","A man becomes what he dreams. And I dreamed of being in the movies. I was brought up on Steve McQueen, Clint Eastwood, Warren Beatty, and Cary Grant.","Fame is like a big piece of meringue - it's beautiful, and you keep eating it, but it doesn't really fill you up.","I know what it's like to be famous. It's good money and it's great fun. A real kick in the pants. People wave at you and smile at you. You get great tables in restaurants. They send you gifts - beautiful clothes and cars.","If I hadn't been an actor, I probably would have been a social worker.","If I knew I could never come back to Ireland, to England, I think I'd fall off the tree.","I ride horses, I love horses, I've owned horses.","I'm an artist, so I love the graphic design of Instagram."],"Pierce Brown":["My roommates are all such happy-go-lucky guys, and I carry some of the stress around a lot more.","I was learning the craft; I didn't study writing in school. Rejection was my motivation, and failure is what taught me.","'Morning Star' is the light that many sailors would use to guide them. But it's also referenced twice in the Bible - once for Lucifer and once for Jesus.","A lot of times, you had to beat the bullies at their own game. But the difficulty is not becoming the bully yourself.","I usually dislike second books in series. The only second installment I ever loved was 'The Empire Strikes Back,' and I think that was wonderful because it evolved the characters while not seeming like a bridge.","If you look at 'Golden Son,' it was just a focused, isolated battle for Mars.","I think girls have a harder time than guys do if you're switching schools. Guys don't get picked on as long as you're OK in sports.","Every high school I went to, I joined in the middle of the year, so sports helped. But you see a lot of bullies when you move to eight states, I'll say that.","I'm kind of irritated by the Hollywood scene.","My editor's main job is to cut down my worldbuilding. There's so much fun stuff in there, you know?","When you look at a lot of the military histories, and even modern military history, everyone pretty much refers to each other by nicknames.","There are so many ideas that you just come up with on a day-to-day basis when you're a writer that it's very difficult to want to go back to an old fling, so to speak.","A lot of times, I faced bullies - or the 'big dogs' at school. What I wanted 'Red Rising' to be is not necessarily an indictment on bullies, but it reflects my experiences and attitudes that I had with bullies growing up.","I have been rejected 120 times, probably because I didn't write the right book.","Conceptually, I always took issue with bullies and those who took advantage of others, whether it was a teacher's cruelty to a student, or a student who picked fights with others.","I've always looked at independent booksellers in a romantic light.","Every hero must return home. Starks to Winterfell. Harry to Privet Drive. Luke Skywalker to Tattoine. Katniss to District twelve. The fun is in seeing how they return."],"Pierfrancesco Favino":["You don't really work for awards, but when they come it's... nice.","As an actor, what you really want to do is communicate with people - this is my aim, my principle aim.","To me, the word 'hero' hasn't got positive or negative value - 'hero' is the person who leads you through the story.","In general, I think you can watch a movie in two different ways. One is the ethical point of view, one is the point of view of the story.","I know that when you talk about something that may hurt someone, reactions are normal, and you are touching some nerves... But I don't do things because people always like what I do.","You know, I think that people give you back what you gave them. I try to be... as I am."],"Pierre Bayle":["It is thus tolerance that is the source of peace, and intolerance that is the source of disorder and squabbling.","The antiquity and general acceptance of an opinion is not assurance of its truth.","There is not less wit nor less invention in applying rightly a thought one finds in a book, than in being the first author of that thought.","I know too much to be a sceptic and too little to be a dogmatist.","There is no less invention in aptly applying a thought found in a book, than in being the first author of the thought.","It is pure illusion to think that an opinion that passes down from century to century, from generation to generation, may not be entirely false.","I am a good Protestant, and in the full sense of the term, for from the bottom of my soul, I protest against everything that is said, and everything that is done.","Properly speaking, history is nothing but the crimes and misfortunes of the human race."],"Pierre Beaumarchais":["Where love is concerned, too much is not even enough.","I quickly laugh at everything for fear of having to cry.","As long as I don't write about the government, religion, politics, and other institutions, I am free to print anything.","Drinking when we are not thirsty and making love at all seasons, madam: that is all there is to distinguish us from other animals.","These days what's not worth saying gets set to music.","If a thing isn't worth saying, you sing it.","It is not necessary to understand things in order to argue about them.","Vilify, Vilify, some of it will always stick.","Because you are a great lord, you believe yourself to be a great genius. You took the trouble to be born, but no more.","I hasten to laugh at everything, for fear of being obliged to weep."],"Pierre Bonnard":["When you forget everything, there only remains yourself - and that is not enough.","I'm trying to do what I have never done - give the impression one has on entering a room: one sees everything and at the same time nothing.","Draw your pleasure, paint your pleasure, and express your pleasure strongly.","Art will never be able to exist without nature.","The precision of naming takes away from the uniqueness of seeing.","I should like to present myself to the young painters of the year 2000 with the wings of a butterfly.","Color does not add a pleasant quality to design - it reinforces it.","One always talks of surrendering to nature. There is also such a thing as surrendering to the picture.","You reason color more than you reason drawing... Color has a logic as severe as form.","Work on the accent, it will enliven the whole.","A painting that is well composed is half finished.","You cannot possibly invent painting all by yourself.","It is still color, it is not yet light.","The important thing is to remember what most impressed you and to put it on canvas as fast as possible."],"Pierre Boulez":["People see me as a theoretician, but my music is also seductive, even spiritual.","I wanted contemporary music to be treated the same as the traditional repertoire - performed regularly by people who knew each other and the music. That is the way you convince an audience.","'Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta' is a kind of expansion of chamber music.","Conducting is more difficult than playing a single instrument. You have to know the culture, to know the score, and to project what you want to hear. Some conductors are well prepared but cannot transmit their ideas to an orchestra, and others are good communicators but have nothing to transmit because they are not absorbed enough in the score.","I always think the relationship between a teacher and a student should be short and maybe violent. You don't need to spend years together. All you need is an explosion: you are the material to explode; the teacher is the detonator.","My parents were so far from the music world that they couldn't conceive how you could make a living. But for me, it was the only solution for the rest of my life.","I said if I ever conducted, I would always give myself the best chance to succeed - though sometimes, despite everything, you still fail.","Certainly I was a bully. I'm not ashamed of it at all. The hostility of the establishment to what you were able to do in the Forties and Fifties was very strong. Sometimes you have to fight against your society.","I almost chose the career of an ethnomusicologist because I was so fascinated by that music. It gives a different feeling of time.","The first time I came to New York in 1952, I was busy with music. I made the acquaintance at this period with John Cage, and also the acquaintance of Varese for the first time. We were very good friends. He gave me some scores, and we recorded them a little later.","I discovered 'Rite of Spring' when I was 21. As a matter of fact, not with orchestra first, because it was still a work which was not often performed. Don't forget that I was 19 in 1944, still the Occupation time. So it was performed slightly after the end of the war, in 1945.","Webern was a kind of 'Kamchatka of music,' an unknown country of music. That's true; for me and people of my generation, he was a radical - you couldn't be more radical than he was.","Acting and performing music is exactly the same. Therefore, an actor, for instance, who is very impressive, he's not simply imitating or trying to imitate, but he must dominate this kind of feeling, and then he transmits it in a much stronger way.","I always admired very much the virtuosity in Strauss because, really, he's a master of using the orchestra. And I like virtuosity, I must say, even if the taste of the music is not always mine.","Some members of the Vienna Philharmonic convinced me to try Bruckner, which I have never done before.

That pulled me up unconsciously because I wanted to be like them, and I wanted to draw.","There are great comic books, these great geniuses that manage to tell you a story in one frame, and that became the thing that opened my eyes.","How can you tell a story with one frame that, by its simplicity, manages to tell a story, a gag that evokes an emotion in you? That became my motto throughout all my life. Simplicity.","Every time I work on a scene or I work on the overall movie, I had my kids unconsciously in mind. Is that going to please them? Is it going to be funny for them? And if it is funny for them, is it going to be funny for their friends and their friends' friends?"],"Pierre Corneille":["We never taste a perfect joy; our happiest successes are mixed with sadness.","Self-love is the source of all our other loves.","To win without risk is to triumph without glory.","A liar is always lavish of oaths.","He who allows himself to be insulted deserves to be.","Happiness seems made to be shared.","Severity is allowable where gentleness has no effect.","We never taste happiness in perfection, our most fortunate successes are mixed with sadness.","It takes good memory to keep up a lie.","This dark brightness that falls from the stars.","To he who avenges a father, nothing is impossible.","Desire increases when fulfillment is postponed.","In recounting our woes, we often soothe them.","Each instant of life is a step toward death.","A good memory is needed after one has lied.","As great as kings may be, they are what we are: they can err like other men.","To take revenge halfheartedly is to court disaster; either condemn or crown your hatred.","He who plays advisor is no longer ambassador.","Master of the universe but not of myself, I am the only rebel against my absolute power.","Deceit is the game of petty spirits, and that is by nature a woman's quality.","Ambition aspires to descend.","One ought to have a good memory when he has told a lie.","True, I am young, but for souls nobly born valor doesn't await the passing of years.","Treachery is noble when aimed at tyranny.","To vanquish without peril is to triumph without glory.","How delicious is pleasure after torment!","The manner of giving is worth more than the gift.","Force is legitimate where gentleness avails not.","A Victory without danger is a triumph without glory.","Guess, if you can, and choose, if you dare.","When the patient loves his disease, how unwilling he is to allow a remedy to be applied.","Alas, I emerge from one disaster to fall into a worse.","To die for one's country is such a worthy fate that all compete for so beautiful a death.","I see, I know, I believe, I am undeceived.","Oh rage!

But here the secret working of self consciousness is almost too entangled with the things of the past for me to explain it.","I still have in my memory, almost agonizing impressions of a serious illness which I had when I was about eight years old. Those about me called it scarlet fever, and its very name seemed to have a diabolical quality.","I still held fast to my determination to become a minister; it still seemed to me that that was my duty. I had pledged myself, in my prayers I had given my word to God. How could I therefore break my vow?","I still went to church regularly every Sunday; that is we all went there together. I reverenced the family pew where we had assembled for so many years; and apart from that reason I hold it dear because it is associated in my memory with my mother.","It is said that many children who live in the central provinces, away from the ocean, have a great longing to see it. I who had never been away from the monotonous country surrounding us looked forward eagerly to seeing the mountains.","It seems to me that it will be very wearisome to be a man.","My emotions lose their force when I endeavor to interpret them, and my words seem very inept.","My sister and my brother, of whom I have not spoken before, were considerably older than I; it seemed almost as if we belonged to different generations.","Often, before returning home, I would take a long and roundabout way and pass by the peaceful ramparts from where I had glimpses of other provinces, and a sight of the distant country.","Painting and music were the only things I worked at industriously and faithfully.","The pyramid once passed there was still a short way to go before we confronted the Sphinx, in the middle of what our contemporaries have left him of his desert.","Unlike most other children, - especially unlike those of today - who are eager to become men and women as speedily as possible, I had a terror of growing up, which became more and more accentuated as I grew older."],"Pierre Moreau":["There is no linguistic war in Montreal.","There's no question in my mind that there's a problem with the funding of our universities here in Quebec.","If a bank is robbed by one of its employees, do you think the bank is corrupt?

And if you believe you selected the right person, then you give that person the freedom, the authority, the delegation to innovate and to lead with some very simple measure.","People want to know on an ongoing basis, 'Am I doing right? Am I moving in the right direction? Do you think I'm progressing?' Nobody's going to wait for an annual cycle to get that feedback.","Accenture has long been a champion of inclusion and diversity and, specifically, gender balance at every level of our organization, including our board of directors.","Success is no longer about changing strategies more often, but having the agility to execute multiple strategies concurrently. And success requires CEOs to develop the right leadership capabilities, workforce skills, and corporate cultures to support digital transformation.","We know from our business with clients around the world that when companies bring together people of different genders, races, cultures, and perspectives, we are smarter, more creative, more innovative, and more relevant.","Do you feel good in your role? If yes, that's the perfect time for you to experiment with something new, to get out of your comfort zone. This willingness to learn is probably the most important thing for leaders of today and tomorrow.","We are always looking ahead to anticipate what next, and our unique innovation architecture enables us to take an innovation-led approach to help our clients invent the future.","The world has always been uncertain. This is the nature of the world.","When I think about strong innovations in term of automation, robotics, cognitive computing, and artificial intelligence, they are coming a lot from the Philippines and from India as well.","We decided to significantly change the nature of the services we are providing to our clients by creating, really, a digital-first company, and digital first in two main directions: first, being the leader in providing digital services to our clients and second, making Accenture the most digitalized organization.","As traditional job descriptions become obsolete, people will need to collaborate in new ways with increasingly intelligent machines.","The Fourth Industrial Revolution demands that CEOs take responsibility for the massive transformation of their businesses and for the extraordinary impact that this transformation will have on wider society.","The need to go digital remains a top priority for clients, and we are investing aggressively to drive innovation and deliver digital transformation.","Increasingly, we are embedding artificial intelligence into the core of our clients' businesses across every function and process.","If I had a dream, it would be that most of the countries in the world, and especially in Europe and the U.S... have more alignment on a set of principles of tax and economic reform that would create an environment that would be more consistent first, definitely more stable.","Sometimes you need to speak up about what you're standing for.","Being surrounded by diverse points of view pushes us beyond our comfort zones. And when people and teams bring multiple perspectives and experiences to the table, the discussions are deeper, the decision-making process is better, and the solutions are stronger.","My background is around economics and finance; yet, of course, in professional services, talent is key. And for many of our clients, whatever the industry, they all are coming to me saying their No. 1 challenge is getting the right talent.","While the digital transformation of industries will be profound, we must keep in mind that it will have wider economic and social impact, too, as with previous revolutions driven by steam and coal, electricity and computers.","Business is doing better than governments.","Now, given the increasing importance of artificial intelligence, automation, machine learning, and other innovative technologies, we are evolving Accenture Digital to be even more relevant to our clients and drive even greater differentiation in the marketplace.","The breadth and scale of the capabilities we provide end-to-end across strategy, consulting, digital, technology, and operations are absolutely unique in the marketplace. And this is why Accenture remains the partner of choice for the world's leading companies in executing large-scale transformation programs.","The rigor and discipline we use in running our business is key to consistently executing our growth strategy. And we systematically applied the same discipline to our investments, including acquisitions.","I could spend all my time on a plane visiting multiple countries, and I would never visit enough.","The broad range of services we provide across our five businesses, together with our deep industry expertise, continues to differentiate Accenture, and we remain the partner of choice for the world's leading companies.","I am a passionate advocate for developing the future workforce, addressing complex social problems, and shaping a regulatory framework. These three subjects all revolve around greater innovation and growth.","Responsible employers who pursue bold growth agendas must embrace intelligent technologies.","Without question, intelligent technologies will continue to disrupt the world as we know it. There will be profound implications, both positive and negative.","Even in mature economies, digital's benefits to society are substantial.","Cities could open up their property and assets to sharing economy apps that make it easier to find parking spaces or homes for rent. By aligning private-sector incentives with the public good, cities will create confidence among taxpayers.","CEOs must go beyond working with policy-makers on new regulatory frameworks. They must also commit to the principle that success cannot be measured by profitability and growth alone.","Businesses that make consumer privacy a point of competitive differentiation will enjoy greater customer loyalty.","Digital companies can reach new customers immediately and at virtually zero marginal cost. They can compete in new sectors by collaborating with peers and competitors. They can massively improve quality and productivity by converging technologies and sources of data.","I am surrounded by exceptional women on Accenture's board of directors as well as my own leadership team.","I am very proud that Accenture is among corporate champions to be honored by the Women's Forum of New York for our mutual commitment to making a difference.","I want our future leaders to know what's possible and to be part of a world where diversity and gender equality aren't special programs but the natural way of operating.","An important part of my job is listening to diverse points of view at all levels - from Millennials starting their careers... to women at the highest levels of leadership... to my own wife and daughter.","Frankly, it can be lonely at the top when it comes to driving diversity.","We will continue to invest in high-growth areas... with a particular focus on digital, cloud, and security services.","We know how to make flexibility when needed.","Do you want an interesting job? Yes. Do you want a balanced life? Yes. And to make a contribution as well?

They want to understand where they are, what might happen, what their future is. And they want to understand that quickly in a very direct conversation.","If I had to probably define and characterize my job, and maybe the job of a CEO today in this global world, highly volatile, uncertain, and when you need to transform is to be the catalyst for change. That's probably the definition I would give to my job. I'm the catalyst.","As CEO of Accenture, I am not French anymore. When I'm in India, I am Indian. We are a company with no physical headquarters. We operate on a virtual level. Our leadership meetings are teleconferences, which is why the Board asked me to stay on in France. And I tell others to stay in their own countries.","We have to continue to build on our strengths and remain successful.","Leveraging cloud, mobility, you process things in a different way. For example, in insurance, you can access more claims through cloud, which makes a big difference in emerging markets, where the populations are large.","The Accenture culture is the same worldwide.","More and more, our clients expect not only relevant advice, not only setting a road map or helping them plan, but being committed to business results.","We are one of the largest enterprise app developers in the world as well as very active in the Internet of Things through our connected platform. So we could connect people to people, device to device, machine to machine, almost everything with everything.","I had good coaches and mentors. They helped me a lot, and I trusted them when they tapped on my shoulder to move to the next level. And maybe I've been smart enough to always say yes more than no when I've been proposed a new and challenging jobs.","I feel I'm probably the luckiest guy on the planet to lead Accenture.","I truly believe Accenture is a magnet for top talent in the new, not only because of the work we do for clients but because our culture supports employees who want to make a difference in the community where we live and work.","The Accenture hybrid class solution for Microsoft Azure will provide a new wave for our clients to transform to a truly enterprise wide hybrid cloud environment.","We continue to operate in a fast-changing environment driven by so much disruption, and in this context, we see significant opportunity and demand for Accenture's highly relevant and differentiated services.","We've truly transformed Accenture capabilities to help our clients embrace the new, applying innovation and intelligence at the heart of their organizations.","As a professional services company, our people ultimately make the difference in delivering high-quality services to clients. This is why we are so focused on attracting the best people and investing to further develop their skills.","Accenture Interactive is working with many of the world's leading brands to transform the customer experience.","Increasingly, the work we do is enabled more and more by new IT, including automation, robotics, and intelligent platforms.","We have the largest digital design studio in the world.","In Dublin, we open The Dock, our new multidisciplinary innovation R&D and incubation hub where all elements of our innovation architecture come to life.

I'd love to track that guy down and tell him that he gave pretty good casting advice.","After months of preparation working with a stylist who explained to me how a fashion house runs and the process of making a dress, I developed a respect for the patience and skill it takes to design these dresses.","I grew up watching Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton.","When preparing a role, I work first on the body language and physical aspects of the performance; the psychological dimension comes naturally once I'm in character."],"Pierre Omidyar":["If you give people the opportunity to do the right thing, you'll rarely be disappointed.","Everyone is born equally capable but lacks equal opportunity.","What I'm really focused on is connecting people around shared interests, so together they can make good stuff happen. I'm more focused on helping people discover their power as individuals, but through those connections with one another.","What makes eBay successful - the real value and the real power at eBay - is the community. It's the buyers and sellers coming together and forming a marketplace.","I do like to fly under the radar. When I walk around town, the only people I want to recognise me and call me by my name are the folks at Starbucks.","When I started eBay, it was a hobby, an experiment to see if people could use the Internet to be empowered through access to an efficient market. I actually wasn't thinking about it in terms of a social impact.","In the early days of eBay, I articulated for the very first time this belief that people are basically good.","I had always been interested in markets - specifically, the theory that in financial markets, goods will trade at a fair value only when everyone has access to the same information.","My parents made me believe I could do anything I wanted to do. They were really into empowering me.","A well-functioning microfinance bank can actually be a profitable business as well. So it became a perfect proof point that, through business, you can provide an experience that leads to individual self-empowerment.","Ebay's success as a company depends on the success of the community of sellers.","Long-term sustainable change happens if people discover their own power.","A lot of people don't just go ahead and try things.","I had the notion that, OK, so now we have all of this wealth, we could buy not only one expensive car, we could buy all of them. As soon as you realize that you could buy all of them, then none of them are particularly interesting or satisfying.","In terms of my belief that one individual can make a difference - that belief comes from my parents.","In 1991, I co-founded my first start-up, Ink Development, which made software for an early tablet computer.","In February of 1996, about six months after I created eBay, I started receiving a spate of complaints. Everyone was complaining about each other. I felt very much like I was a parent who had to adjudicate the brothers beating each other up.","As a philanthropist, I try to help people take ownership. Everything I've done is rooted in the notion that every human being is born equally capable. What people lack is equal opportunity.","News organisations that have been around a while have a lot of traditions and ways of doing things that may have served them for many years but perhaps make them less flexible in the digital era. As an entrepreneur, it just makes more sense to start something new.","I'm a technologist by origin and by training, but I'm focused on philanthropy.","When you have mass surveillance, it's impossible to meet the intent of the First Amendment because reporters can't talk to sources because sources are afraid to talk.","Technologists come at a problem from the point of view that the system is working a certain way, and if I engage in that system and actually change the rules of the system, I can make it work a different way.","Advertisers don't want to put their ads next to the investigative story; it's extremely difficult to do that. And very few people today actually read those serious news stories on the Web now.","eBay's business is based on enabling someone to do business with another person, and to do that, they first have to develop some measure of trust, either in the other person or the system.","If you can get over this initial distrust that people have of strangers, you can do remarkable things.","You can invest in companies, you can help grow companies, you can be a venture capitalist - and be a philanthropist at the same time.","In the same way that you're driven in your business to keep innovating - Facebook is a wonderful example of constant innovation - think about doing that in philanthropy.","I developed an interest in supporting independent journalists in a way that leverages their work to the greatest extent possible, all in support of the public interest.","My dad was a physician. As a kid, I remember driving around with him on weekends so he could do his rounds at the hospital and talk to patients. We'd spend time in the car talking about what was going on with them, their stories.","In order to access private capital, you have to provide competitive return on investment. In order to give competitive returns to investors, you've got to operate on a profitable basis and be thinking of yourself as a business.","Microfinance initiatives are very high-touch models. The loan officer meets with local groups of borrowers every week, they share tips and techniques.

If he's got time for mistresses after all that, what the hell difference does it make?","I am not very introspective.","I had been in so many towns and cities in America with John Kennedy, but I was not with him in Dallas, Texas, on November 21, 1963.","I lost two of the greatest men I've ever known to assassination - and a son to suicide.","I may be plucky, but I am not stupid.","I was one of the first people to learn that Jackie was going to marry Aristotle Onassis.","I've had at least my share of tragedy, but I have had far more than my share of happiness.","Jackie Kennedy was magnificent in the days and weeks immediately following her husband's assassination. She was especially wonderful to me.","On several occasions President Kennedy encouraged me to take a lover, an obvious sign he also had some himself.","Onassis was a man who loved to walk, to walk and talk, and he was the kind of man who doesn't go to sleep at night-he talks and talks.","One of the problems with a candidate like Bob Kennedy, and his brother before him, was that people assumed they didn't need contributions.","President Kennedy was a voracious reader and was forever coming up with fascinating bits of information.","The day I became press secretary to the President of the United States, I was in an entirely different world from the one I'd been in the day before.","The death of JFK to the resignation of Richard Nixon marked a great turning point in American life.","The French were mystified about the Watergate scandal.","There have not been children of comparable youth in the White House since the Kennedy era.","To outlive one's child is a terrible thing, but to do so because your child has taken his or her life is horrible.","Whole generations have forgotten history."],"Pierre Schaeffer":["Take a sound from whatever source, a note on a violin, a scream, a moan, a creaking door, and there is always this symmetry between the sound basis, which is complex and has numerous characteristics which emerge through a process of comparison within our perception.","Sound is the vocabulary of nature.","In contrast, traditional classical music starts from an abstract musical schema. This is then notated and only expressed in concrete sound as a last stage, when it is performed.","Barbarians always think of themselves as the bringers of civilization.","The impressionists, Debussy, Faure, in France, did take a few steps forward.","The world changes materially. Science makes advances in technology and understanding. But the world of humanity doesn't change.","Noises have generally been thought of as indistinct, but this is not true.","First, it doesn't surprise me that traditional music has experienced a kind of exhaustion in the 20th century - not forgetting that many musicians started to look outside the traditional structures of tonality.","Has it struck you that the music which is regarded as the most sublime in western civilization, which is the music of Bach, is called baroque?","I'm very aware of what you're talking about as I was involved with the radio in Africa in the same period as I was doing Concrete - I was doing both at the same time.","It's ridiculous that time and time again we need a radioactive cloud coming out of a nuclear power-station to remind us that atomic energy is extraordinarily dangerous.","Morally, the world is both better and worse than it was. We are worse off than in the middle ages, or the 17th and 18th centuries, in that we have the atomic menace.","People who share the same language, French or Chinese or whatever, have the same vocal cords and emit sounds which are basically the same, as they come from the same throats and lungs.","The moment at which music reveals its true nature is contained in the ancient exercise of the theme with variations. The complete mystery of music is explained right there.","The only hope is that our civilization will collapse at a certain point, as always happens in history. Then, out of barbarity, a renaissance.","The whole problem of the sound-work is distancing oneself from the dramatic.","The world has just got more dangerous because the things we use have got more dangerous."],"Pierre Teilhard de Chardin":["The most satisfying thing in life is to have been able to give a large part of one's self to others.","Someday, after mastering the winds, the waves, the tides and gravity, we shall harness for God the energies of love, and then, for a second time in the history of the world, man will have discovered fire.","We are not human beings having a spiritual experience. We are spiritual beings having a human experience.","The world is round so that friendship may encircle it.","It is our duty as men and women to proceed as though the limits of our abilities do not exist.","Love is an adventure and a conquest. It survives and develops, like the universe itself, only by perpetual discovery.","Being happy is a matter of personal taste.","We spend our lives, all of us, waiting for the great day, the great battle, or the deed of power. But that external consummation is not given to many: nor is it necessary. So long as our being is tensed, directed with passion, towards that which is the spirit of all things, then that spirit will emerge from our own hidden, nameless effort.","In the final analysis, the questions of why bad things happen to good people transmutes itself into some very different questions, no longer asking why something happened, but asking how we will respond, what we intend to do now that it happened.","Growing old is like being increasingly penalized for a crime you haven't committed.","We are one, after all, you and I, together we suffer, together exist and forever will recreate each other.","I give the name of cosmic sense to the more or less confused affinity that binds us psychologically to the All which envelops us. The existence of this feeling is indubitable, and apparently as old as the beginning of thought... The cosmic sense must have been born as soon as man found himself facing the forest, the sea and the stars.","Nothing can resist the person who smiles at life - I don't mean the ironic and disillusioned smile of my grandfather, but the triumphant smile of the person who knows that he will survive, or that at least he will be saved by what seems to be destroying him.","A sense of the universe, a sense of the all, the nostalgia which seizes us when confronted by nature, beauty, music - these seem to be an expectation and awareness of a Great Presence.","Love is the affinity which links and draws together the elements of the world... Love, in fact, is the agent of universal synthesis.","It doesn't matter if the water is cold or warm if you're going to have to wade through it anyway.","One mustn't close one's eyes to difficulty and to shortcomings; the more one recognizes them, the less they upset one.","Love alone is capable of uniting living beings in such a way as to complete and fulfill them, for it alone takes them and joins them by what is deepest in themselves.","If we are to be happy, we must first react against our tendency to follow the line of least resistance, a tendency that causes us either to remain as we are, or to look primarily to activities external to ourselves for what will provide new impetus to our lives.","The longer I live, the more I feel that true repose consists in 'renouncing' one's own self, by which I mean making up one's mind to admit that there is no importance whatever in being 'happy' or 'unhappy' in the usual meaning of the words.","If there is one thing I fear less than everything else, it is, I believe, persecution for my opinions. There are a good many points about which I may be diffident, but when it comes to questions of Truth and intellectual independence, there is no holding me - I can envisage no finer end than to sacrifice oneself for a conviction.","Let man live at a distance from God, and the universe remains neutral or hostile to him. But let man believe in God, and immediately all around him the elements, even the irksome, of the inevitable organize themselves into a friendly whole, ordered to the ultimate success of life.","Humanity is still advancing; and it will probably continue to advance for hundreds of thousands of years more, always on condition that we know how to keep the same line of advance as our ancestors towards ever greater consciousness and complexity.","For me, the Immaculate Conception is the feast of 'passive action,' the action that functions simply by the transmission through us of divine energy. Purity, in spite of outward appearances, is essentially an active virtue, because it concentrates God in us and on those who are subject to our influence.","The profoundly 'atomic' character of the universe is visible in everyday experience, in raindrops and grains of sand, in the hosts of the living, and the multitude of stars; even in the ashes of the dead.","The universe as we know it is a joint product of the observer and the observed.","I owe the best of myself to geology, but everything it has taught me tends to turn me away from dead things.","Christ has conquered death, not only by suppressing its evil effects, but by reversing its sting. By virtue of Christ's rising again, nothing any longer kills inevitably, but everything is capable of becoming the blessed touch of the divine hands, the blessed influence of the will of God upon our lives.","Morality arose largely as an empirical defence of the individual and society. Ever since intelligent beings began to be in contact, and consequently in friction, they have felt the need to guard themselves against each other's encroachments.","Is evolution a theory, a system, or an hypothesis? It is much more: it is a general condition to which all theories, all hypotheses, all systems must bow and which they must satisfy henceforward if they are to be thinkable and true.","How great is the mystery of the first cells which were one day animated by the breath of our souls! How impossible to decipher the welding of successive influences in which we are forever incorporated! In each one of us, through matter, the whole history of the world is in part reflected.","He that will believe only what he can fully comprehend must have a long head or a very short creed.","Love in all its subtleties is nothing more, and nothing less, than the more or less direct trace marked on the heart of the element by the psychical convergence of the universe upon itself.","Long before the awakening of thought on earth, manifestations of cosmic energy must have been produced which have no parallel today.","Through fidelity, we situate ourselves and maintain ourselves in the hands of God so exactly as to become one with them in their action.","Truly, there is a Christian note which makes the whole World vibrate, like an immense gong, in the divine Christ. This note is unique and universal, and in it alone consists the Gospel.","I have finally decided to write my book on the spiritual life. I mean to put down as simply as possible the sort of ascetical or mystical teaching that I have been living and preaching so long. I call it 'Le Milieu Divin,' but I am being careful to include nothing esoteric and the minimum of explicit philosophy.","From a purely positivist point of view, man is the most mysterious and disconcerting of all the objects met with by science.","Evolution is a light illuminating all facts, a curve that all lines must follow.","Everywhere on Earth, at this moment, in the new spiritual atmosphere created by the appearance of the idea of evolution, there float, in a state of extreme mutual sensitivity, love of God and faith in the world: the two essential components of the Ultra-human.","Love is a sacred reserve of energy; it is like the blood of spiritual evolution.","In the divine milieu, all the elements of the universe touch each other by that which is most inward and ultimate in them. There they concentrate, little by little, all that is purest and most attractive in them without loss and without danger of subsequent corruption.","The earth's crust has not yet stopped heaving and plunging under our feet. Mountain ranges are still being thrust up on the horizon. Granites are still growing under the continental masses. Nor has the organic world ceased to produce new buds at the tips of its countless branches.","Certain though I am - and ever more certain - that I must press on in life as though Christ awaited me at the term of the universe, at the same time I feel no special assurance of the existence of Christ. Believing is not seeing. As much as anyone, I imagine, I walk in the shadows of faith.","We have but one permanent home: heaven - that's still the old truth that we always have to re-learn - and it's only through the impact of sad experiences that we assimilate it.","In each soul, God loves and partly saves the whole world which that soul sums up in an incommunicable and particular way.","Driven by the forces of love, the fragments of the world seek each other so that the world may come to being.","At the heart of every being lies creation's dream of a principle that will one day give organic form to its fragmented treasures. God is unity.","Religion and science are the two conjugated faces or phases of one and the same complete act of knowledge - the only one which can embrace the past and future of evolution and so contemplate, measure and fulfil them.","A Religion of Evolution: that, when all is said and done, is what Man needs ever more explicitly if he is to survive and 'superlive,' as soon as he becomes conscious of his power to ultra-hominize himself and of his duty to do so.","By its birth, and for all time, Christianity is pledged to the Cross and dominated by the sign of the Cross. It cannot remain its own self except by identifying itself ever more intensely with the essence of the Cross.","I feel a distaste for hunting, first because of a kind of Buddhist respect for the unity and sacredness of all life, and also because the pursuit of a hare or chamois strikes me as a kind of 'escape of energy,' that is, the expenditure of our effort in an illusory end, one devoid of profit.","Man can be understood only by ascending from physics, chemistry, biology, and geology. In other words, he is first of all a cosmic problem.","To say that Christ is the term and motive force of evolution, to say that he manifests himself as 'evolver,' is implicitly to recognize that he becomes attainable in and through the whole process of evolution.","The Hindu religions gave me the impression of a vast well into which one plunges in order to grasp the reflection of the sun.","For ninety per cent of those who view him from outside, the Christian God looks like a great landowner administering his estates, the world. Now this conventional picture, which is too well justified by appearances, corresponds in no way to the dogmatic basis or point of view of the Gospels.","Have you ever thought how humiliating and distressing it was to be placed upon a sphere? For friendship it is a boon never to be able to be further apart than the antipodes. But suppose that you are leaving together to go on and on; it is impossible. To go beyond a certain point is to return to where you began.","In a way, the whole tangible universe itself is a vast residue, a skeleton of countless lives that have germinated in it and have left it, leaving behind them only a trifling, infinitesimal part of their riches.","By the sole fact of his entering into 'Thought,' man represents something entirely singular and absolutely unique in the field of our experience. On a single planet, there could not be more than one centre of emergence for reflexion.","The mineral world is a much more supple and mobile world than could be imagined by the science of the ancients. Vaguely analogous to the metamorphoses of living creatures, there occurs in the most solid rocks, as we now know, perpetual transformation of a mineral species.","I am not enough of a mathematician to be able to judge either the well-foundedness or the limits of relativity in physics.","Death surrenders us totally to God: it makes us enter into him; we must, in return, surrender ourselves to death with absolute love and self-abandonment since, when death comes, all we can do is to surrender ourselves completely to the domination and guidance of God.","For ideas to prevail, many of their defenders have to die in obscurity. Their anonymous influence makes itself felt.","Man is unable to see himself entirely unrelated to mankind, neither is he able to see mankind unrelated to life, nor life unrelated to the universe.","The Church is like a great tree whose roots must be energetically anchored in the earth while its leaves are serenely exposed to the bright sunlight. In this way, she sums up a whole gamut of beats in a single living and all-embracing act, each one of which corresponds to a particular degree or a possible form of spiritualisation.","The pagan loves the earth in order to enjoy it and confine himself within it; the Christian in order to make it purer and draw from it the strength to escape from it.","Mankind, the spirit of the earth, the synthesis of individuals and peoples, the paradoxical conciliation of the element with the whole, and of unity with multitude - all these are called Utopian, and yet they are biologically necessary.","To our critical eyes, the threads of which the past is woven are, by nature, endless and indivisible. Scientifically speaking, we cannot grasp the absolute beginning of anything: everything extends backwards to be prolonged by something else.","Personal success or personal satisfaction are not worth another thought if one does achieve them, or worth worrying about if they evade one or are slow in coming. All that is really worth while is action - faithful action, for the world, and in God.","The quantity and quality of consciousness, one may say, have always been growing throughout geological times. In this respect man, in whom nervous organisation and therefore psychological powers have attained an undisputed maximum, may be considered, scientifically, as a natural centre of evolution of the primates.","Whether one welcomes or deplores it, nothing is more surely and exactly characteristic of modern times than the irresistible invasion of the human world by technology. Mechanism invading like a tide all the places of the earth and all forms of social activity.","We must accept what science tells us, that man was born from the earth. But, more logical than the scientists who lecture us, we must carry this lesson to its conclusion: that is to say, accept that man was born entirely from the world - not only his flesh and bones but his incredible power of thought.","How can one preach goodness and love to men without at the same time offering them an interpretation of the World that justifies this goodness and this love?","Historically, the stuff of the universe goes on becoming concentrated into ever more organized forms of matter.","At the extreme temperature occurring in the stars, matter can only survive in its most dissociated states. Only simple bodies exist on these incandescent stars.","The earth was probably born by accident; but, in accordance with one of the most general laws of evolution, scarcely had this accident happened than it was immediately made use of and recast into something naturally directed.","Regarded zoologically, man is today an almost isolated figure in nature. In his cradle, he was less isolated.","There is neither spirit nor matter in the world. The stuff of the universe is spirit-matter. No other substance but this could have produced the human molecule.","However far back I go into my childhood, nothing seems to me more characteristic of, or more familiar in, my interior economy than the appetite or irresistible demand for some 'Unique all-sufficing and necessary reality.'","At the age when other children, I imagine, experience their first 'feeling' for a person, or for art, or for religion, I was affectionate, good, and even pious: by that I mean that under the influence of my mother, I was devoted to the Child Jesus.","Deep down, there is in the substance of the cosmos a primordial disposition, sui generis, for self-arrangement and self-involution.","All I know is that, thanks to a sort of habit which has always been ingrained in me, I have never, at any moment of my life, experienced the least difficulty in addressing myself to God as to a supreme Someone.","The facts tell us that no religious Faith releases - or ever has released at any moment in History - a higher degree of warmth, a more intense dynamism of unification than the Christianity of our own day - and the more Catholic it is, the truer my words.","When all is said and done, what constitutes the impregnable superiority of Christianity over all other types of Faith is that it is ever more consciously identified with a Christogenesis: in other words, with an awareness of the rise of a certain universal Presence which is at once immortalizing and unifying.","What is imponderable in the world is greater than what we can handle.","All ways of living can be sanctified, and for each individual, the ideal way is that to which our Lord leads him through the natural development of his tastes and the pressure of circumstances.","I think that man has a fundamental obligation to extract from himself and from the earth all that it can give; and this obligation is all the more imperative that we are absolutely ignorant of what limits - they may still be very distant - God has imposed on our natural understanding and power.","It seems to me that terrestrial beings, as they become more autonomous, psychologically richer, shut themselves up in a way against one another, and at the same time gradually become strangers to the cosmic environment and currents, impenetrable to one another, and incapable of exteriorizing themselves.","For me, the real earth is that chosen part of the universe, still almost universally dispersed and in course of gradual segregation, but which is little by little taking on body and form in Christ.","Man the individual consoles himself for his passing with the thought of the offspring or the works which he leaves behind.","The incomparable greatness of the religions of the East lies in their having been second to none in vibrating with the passion for unity. This note, which is essential to every form of mysticism, has even penetrated them so deeply that we find ourselves falling under a spell simply by uttering the names of their Gods.","We often represent God to ourselves as being able to draw from non-being a world without sorrows, faults, dangers - a world in which there is no damage, no breakage. This is a conceptual fantasy and makes it impossible to solve the problem of evil.","It is a curious thing: man, the centre and creator of all science, is the only object which our science has not yet succeeded in including in a homogeneous representation of the universe. We know the history of his bones, but no ordered place has yet been found in nature for his reflective intelligence.","Religion, born of the earth's need for the disclosing of a god, is related to and co-extensive with not the individual man, but the whole of mankind.","To be Catholic is the only way of being fully and utterly Christian.","The more nobly a man wills and acts, the more avid he becomes for great and sublime aims to pursue. He will no longer be content with family, country, and the remunerative aspect of his work. He will want wider organisations to create, new paths to blaze, causes to uphold, truths to discover, an ideal to cherish and defend.","The problem of evil, that is to say the reconciling of our failures, even the purely physical ones, with creative goodness and creative power, will always remain one of the most disturbing mysteries of the universe for both our hearts and our minds.","The history of the kingdom of God is, directly, one of a reunion. The total divine milieu is formed by the incorporation of every elected spirit in Jesus Christ.","What I cry out for, like every being, with my whole life and all my earthly passion, is something very different from an equal to cherish: it is a God to adore.","To discover and know has always been a deep tendency of our nature. Can we not recognize it already in caveman?","The number of known human fossils only increases slowly. But the manner of regarding and assessing them is capable of progressing rapidly, as indeed it does. In the absence of any absolutely sensational discovery in prehistory, there is an up-to-date and scientific manner of understanding man, which is solidly based on palaeontology.","Humanity at the centre of the primates, Homo sapiens, in humanity, is the end-product of a gradual work of creation, the successive sketches for which still surround us on every side.","Progressively saved by the machine from the anxieties that bound his hands and mind to material toil, relieved of a large part of his work and compelled to an ever-increasing speed of action by the devices which his intelligence cannot help ceaselessly creating and perfecting, man is about to find himself abruptly plunged into idleness.","I would like to express the thoughts of a man who, having finally penetrated the partitions and ceilings of little countries, little coteries, little sects, rises above all these categories and finds himself a child and citizen of the Earth.","My roots are in Paris, and I will not pull them up.","Neither the Christian attitude of love for all mankind nor humane hopes for an organized society must cause us to forget that the 'human stratum' may not be homogeneous.","Death is acceptable only if it represents the physically necessary passage toward a union, the condition of a metamorphosis.","I came to China to follow my star and to steep myself in the raw regions of the universe.","I am a little too absorbed by science to be able to philosophise much; but the more I look into myself, the more I find myself possessed by the conviction that it is only the science of Christ running through all things, that is to say true mystical science, that really matters. I let myself get caught up in the game when I geologise.","Surely the wake left behind by mankind's forward march reveals its movement just as clearly as the spray thrown up elsewhere by the prow.","Everyone, no doubt, remains first and foremost a man of his own country and continues to draw from it his motive force.","I greatly enjoyed the Hawaiian Islands. They are a real little paradise in spite of the influx of Americans who have made it one of their most pleasant 'centers of resort': the soft climate and luxuriance of the tropics; the greenness, the fragrance, the flowers - extraordinary flowers covering the tallest trees and turning them into huge bouquets."],"Pierre Trudeau":["Canada will be a strong country when Canadians of all provinces feel at home in all parts of the country, and when they feel that all Canada belongs to them.","My life is one long curve, full of turning points.","I bear solemn witness to the fact that NATO heads of state and of government meet only to go through the tedious motions of reading speeches, drafted by others, with the principal objective of not rocking the boat.","We wish nothing more, but we will accept nothing less. Masters in our own house we must be, but our house is the whole of Canada.","Living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant. No matter how friendly and even-tempered is the beast, if I can call it that, one is affected by every twitch and grunt.","Luck, that's when preparation and opportunity meet.","The state has no business in the bedrooms of the nation.","The essential ingredient of politics is timing."],"Pierre de Coubertin":["The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not winning but taking part; the essential thing in life is not conquering but fighting well.","For each individual, sport is a possible source for inner improvement.","May joy and good fellowship reign, and in this manner, may the Olympic Torch pursue its way through ages, increasing friendly understanding among nations, for the good of a humanity always more enthusiastic, more courageous and more pure.","Holding an Olympic Games means evoking history.","The important thing in life is not to triumph but to compete.","The Olympic Spirit is neither the property of one race nor of one age.","The important thing in life is not victory but combat; it is not to have vanquished but to have fought well.","The Olympic Games were created for the exhaltation of the individual athlete.","The Olympic Games are the quadrennial celebration of the springtime of humanity.","A country can truly call itself sporting when the majority of its people feel a personal need for sport.","Olympism seeks to create a way of life based on the joy found in effort, the educational value of a good example and respect for universal fundamental ethical principles.","The day when a sportsman stops thinking above all else of the happiness in his own effort and the intoxication of the power and physical balance he derives from it, the day when he lets considerations of vanity or interest take over, on this day his ideal will die.","In our view the Olympic idea involves a strong physical culture supplemented on the one hand by mobility, what is so aptly called 'fair play', and on the other hand by aesthetics, that is the cultivation of what is beautiful and graceful.","The Olympic Games are for the world and all nations must be admitted to them.","Sport must be the heritage of all men and of all social classes.","Sport is part of every man and woman's heritage and its absence can never be compensated for.","Racial distinctions should not play a role in sport.","If he is knocked out of the competition, he encourages his brothers with his words and presence.","All sports for all people.","Swifter, higher, stronger.","The Games were created for the glorification of the individual champion.","The Olympic Movement gives the world an ideal which reckons with the reality of life, and includes a possibility to guide this reality toward the great Olympic Idea.","Sport must be accessible to working class youth.","Sport is the habitual and voluntary cultivation of intensive physical effort.","For me sport was a religion... with religious sentiment.","In no way can sport be considered a luxury object.","All sports must be treated on the basis of equality.","Olympism... exalting and combining in a balanced whole the qualities of body, mind and will.","Success comprises in itself the seeds of its own decline and sport is not spared by this law.","In the Olympic Oath, I ask for only one thing: sporting loyalty."],"Pierre de Fermat":["I have found a very great number of exceedingly beautiful theorems.","It is impossible for any number which is a power greater than the second to be written as a sum of two like powers. I have a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain.","And perhaps, posterity will thank me for having shown it that the ancients did not know everything.","I am more exempt and more distant than any man in the world.","But it is impossible to divide a cube into two cubes, or a fourth power into fourth powers, or generally any power beyond the square into like powers; of this I have found a remarkable demonstration. This margin is too narrow to contain it.","I will share all of this with you whenever you wish."],"Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang":["It's a great honour to be recognised and appreciated by your fellow colleagues.","Real Madrid? There is no agreement, but I promised my grandfather I would play there one day. Why wouldn't I want to discover new things? As I've said several times, I'd like to play in Spain and have good weather for once in my life!","The only club that could lure me away from Dortmund is Real Madrid.","It's great to see my hard work paying off, even if it's not finished.","It is France. I know the league well. It is my mother tongue. Inevitably, there is an attraction for me. A return? It might not be my first choice, but of course, it is not impossible.","I believe, and, when I pray, I ask to become one of the best attackers on the planet.","I am feeling very well here and want to achieve much more with BVB and win titles. I am here and nowhere else: not at Arsenal, not at Barcelona, and not on the moon.","I have said in the past that I dream of playing in Spain, but Dortmund has become my second home. I love this club, its fans, and this city.","The most important thing is that I continue to improve.","Klopp would reproach me for not tracking back properly. I took things on board, and I listened to him. I worked hard in training; I stayed behind after training. That's what helped me to shine in the Bundesliga because I scored quite a lot of goals despite some difficult games in the league.","Dortmund is a fantastic club, critical for my career. But my Spanish grandfather on my mother's side always wished that I play in Spain. And if, then at Real Madrid.","People talk about me, and that's good, but a lot of it has been down to how my team-mates have supported me.","I have progressed. I have worked a lot in front of goal, trying to keep a cool head, trying not to force things.","I have the full confidence of the coach, and that's extremely important to me.","The interaction with Marco Reus is also very good. We understand each other very well, both on and off the pitch. If we get along privately, then that affects things on the pitch. We're almost like brothers.","Lewandowski is very complete. He can hold on to the ball and build play; he can dribble. He can score goals from anywhere. He is fast, strong in the air.","No one can predict the future.","I focus only on the work with my team-mates with Dortmund and Gabon.","Never would I switch to Bayern.","Real is the club of my heart, and I promised my grandfather that I would play there one day. I hope that it will happen.","It's true that PSG have the ambition to win the Champions League, so they could be interesting for a player like me.","Tuchel shows me how to move and what I could do better. He wants to take me to absolute top level.","As far as I know, Mr. Watzke has not said he would sell me if somebody offered 100m. He has emphasised that the club would like to continue working with me. The club is just greedy for success - and so am I.","Robert Lewandowski is a fantastic forward. He challenges me in every match with his performances and goals.","Our style of play is increasingly based on possession of the ball. It suits me as a forward. We've got an attacking approach, and that means that I get a lot of chances; otherwise, I would have not been able to score so many goals.","The Torjagerkanone means a lot to me. It was a great effort - made by the whole team.","I am grateful to everybody: the training staff, my fellow players, and everybody who works for the club. It is just great.","It's frustrating when you make the efforts but the conditions are not there to make a great tournament.","I want to thank my team mates in the national team and also at Dortmund. It is their work that helps me to score goals.","For the parents of the youth of Africa, please give your kids a chance to realise their dreams.","I am really pleased to sign permanently with St. Etienne. It was my ambition in coming to St. Etienne. This is one of the finest passages of my young career.","To join a great club is nice and all, but you have to play the games.","I have no dream. I shall no longer speak of Madrid. They don't want me. This is not a problem. I move forward; I am well in Dortmund.","China, I didn't take it seriously; it was a lack of professionalism. They delayed to send us a written offer - It was a disaster.","I hope Dortmund can reach the final of the Champions League again... why not?","We had an agreement with Borussia that I could leave. It didn't happen. It is a disappointment. But I'm also happy to stay.","Milan offered me something. I was very interested by the project. It did not happen for many reasons.","I like staying here very much, as I feel at home in Dortmund.","A lot of people would like to see me in England. This is not necessarily the league that attracts me the most, though. It would allow me to develop further, though.","I really like the Spanish league and find it attractive.","The French league is clearly developing. It is really pleasing to see. Paris, for me, is above everyone else in France. When they come for you, it is always attractive.","I'll never go to Bavaria, that's for sure. That would be too hard for the Dortmund fans. No matter what they offer me, I would say no. Absolutely no way.","I've played for St. Etienne, and the fans told me I should never go to Lyon. So I didn't go.","I'm like this. When I feel something, I want to do something, I do it - I just do it. So I'm like this also in my life: if I want to wear some crazy clothes, I put it on.","If I want to do something like the Batman mask, I just do it. I was like this all the time; I think nobody can change me.","It's amazing - you know, you just look up, and you say, 'Wow, that's amazing.' It's 25,000 people only on one side, so of course you enjoy it. Every time when you go on the pitch, it's just crazy. They know when we need some energy; they have a button, so it's perfect. But you feel it; you feel it, of course.","In France, sometimes, you have some players or coaches say, 'If we go there, and we come back with one point, it's okay.' Here? No chance of this! Everybody wants to win. I think every team is playing to win matches, so the game is hard and fast, intensive. I really like the Bundesliga for that.","I know many people said I couldn't go to China because it would be a step backwards in football terms, but I think anyone would at least consider such an offer.","I want to get the maximum out of my career. Football is my life. And when my career is over, I want to look after my family to help my children. That is all.","I was never tempted by the Premier League. It's simply a personal opinion.","My childhood dream? To play at Real Madrid. In 2014, before he died, I promised my grandfather who was from Avila, 110 kilometers from Madrid, that I would play there. It will be complicated, but it sits in a corner of my head.","When I was a kid, I watched Hugo Sanchez videos. The backflip I sometimes do when I score is actually an homage to him.","I will choose England before any other destination. My dream has always been to play in one of the top two leagues in the world. Newcastle is a good club, and St James's Park is a monumental stadium where there is passionate fans.","In football, nothing lasts forever.","Klopp gave me strength of character and helped me progress. He's a charismatic person, and I have a lot of respect for this man.","Klopp helped me play my favourite position again - centre-forward.","If Spurs ever came back in me for me, I'd say no.","Lots of people think that the Premier League would be good for me, but my mum is Spanish, and I really have that dream to play over there.","Some players have ambitions, and therefore, they leave and want to experience something new, you know.","If Real want me, they will call me one day, and, if not, no problem. I live my life and am optimistic about the future.","You can take it for granted that I am not going to waste any time thinking about giving up how happy I am at Borussia, in the city of Dortmund, and with this team.","If I didn't believe that I could win titles with Dortmund, then I wouldn't be here.","Samuel Eto'o I know well. We see each other often; we send each other messages, and we call each other. It's good."],"Pierre-Gilles de Gennes":["What do we mean by soft matter? Americans prefer to call it 'complex fluids.' This is a rather ugly name, which tends to discourage the young students.","Surfactants allow us to protect a water surface and to generate these beautiful soap bubbles, which are the delight of our children.","Usually a fiber, after being dipped in a liquid, shows a string of droplets, and thus, for some time, people thought that most common fibers were non-wettable.","I have emphasized experiments more than theory. Of course, we need some theory when thinking of soft matter.","The essential property of insoluble bilayers is that they optimise their area at fixed surfactant number.","Benjamin Franklin performed a beautiful experiment using surfactants: on a pond at Clapham Common, he poured a small amount of oleic acid, a natural surfactant which tends to form a dense film at the water-air interface."],"Pierre-Joseph Proudhon":["When deeds speak, words are nothing.","Communism is inequality, but not as property is. Property is exploitation of the weak by the strong. Communism is exploitation of the strong by the weak.","I build no system. I ask an end to privilege, the abolition of slavery, equality of rights, and the reign of law. Justice, nothing else; that is the alpha and omega of my argument: to others I leave the business of governing the world.","A common danger tends to concord. Communism is the exploitation of the strong by the weak. In Communism, inequality comes from placing mediocrity on a level with excellence.","All parties without exception, when they seek for power, are varieties of absolutism.","Property is theft.","The great are only great because we are on our knees. Let us rise!","The possessions of the rich are stolen property."],"Piers Anthony":["When one person makes an accusation, check to be sure he himself is not the guilty one. Sometimes it is those whose case is weak who make the most clamour.","In fact, I believe that we need better sex education in our own culture, here in America, so that young folk learn about things like venereal disease before they encounter it.","But I don't read or listen for pleasure. I have too much else to do.","One reason I don't suffer Writer's Block is that I don't wait on the muse, I summon it at need.","Normally I work out a general summary of what I mean to do, then start writing, and the details can be different from my anticipation. So there is considerable flow, but always within channels.","All things make sense; you just have to fathom how they make sense.","That most dangerous of opponents: the one who took pains to comprehend the position of his adversary.","As for collaboration - I have done a lot, 26 books, and found publishers increasingly resistive to them. It's not that the books are bad; editors won't even read them.","At present I answer about 100 letters a month, and read 300 emails.","At the time I wrote Xone I had never been on the Internet.","Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker series also shows the potential of lighter fantastic fiction. I read the first, and listened to a tape of a later one, and it's fun.","Have a working spouse, because you won't earn a living from writing - not at first, if ever. My wife worked for years to support us.","I did not know at first that it would be a series; I discovered after the first novel that I had more to say about it, so I did another. And another, and then the readers demanded yet more.","I do one Xanth novel a year, because at the moment that is all that publishers will accept; they don't want any other type of fiction from me, so Xanth pays my way.","I don't want ever to be guilty of what my critics claim: doing formula without original elements.","I have always admired the work of Phil Farmer and was glad for the chance to work with him. Readers today may be too young to remember his classics like The Lovers.","I hope to read a Harry Potter novel soon, to see what it's all about. I admit to being annoyed that many good light fantasy writers have had trouble getting published, in England and elsewhere, when it is obvious the readers were waiting for us all along.","I maintain an ongoing survey of Internet Publishing and self publishing, so that it is now possible for any writer with a book to get it published at nominal cost or free, and to have it on sale at booksellers like Amazon.com.","I never do a full outline, and if I did, I would not feel bound to it, because the view from inside a scene can be different from the view outside it. But neither do I just start writing and see what happens; I am far more disciplined than that.","I turned my home state of Florida into the Land of Xanth.","I wish my readers took less of my time - about a third of my working time goes to them - but I love and need them all.","If every editor turns you down, maybe you should take a second look at your text, however, just in case.","It would be easier to write a novel without reader input, but I feel the fiction is richer for it.","Keep writing, because not only does practice improve skill, it gives you more chances to score on the market. I did that for eight years before making my first sale.","No novel is a clone of any preceding one, though with a background cast of characters and things that has grown to thousands, there are many familiar aspects.","Princess Rose should indeed be a TV movie, assuming something doesn't go wrong. I don't know how good a movie it will be, because the way movie folk think is different from the way writers think, and I distrust what isn't done my way. This is what I call a healthy paranoia.","SF is the literature of the theoretically possible, and F is the literature of the impossible.","What I like least is dealing with publishers who simply don't want collaborations regardless of their merit.","When I started writing this, I found that I simply couldn't take fantasy seriously, so it became humorous, and continued from there."],"Piers Corbyn":["Polar bears did very well in the warmer times. They didn't die out at all; they didn't die out in the last 10,000 years, nor during the previous interglacial, nor the one before that. So, they're just used as a deceitful heartthrob; you know, to pluck your heartstrings because the polar bears might die out.","We have to keep up the fight for evidence-based science and policy.","Computer modelling for weather forecasting, and indeed for climate forecasting, has reached its limits.","It's not the case that carbon dioxide drives temperatures. When you leave Ice Ages, it's the other way around: The temperatures go up first, and then carbon dioxide levels go up.","My view is that climate changes have happened in the last 80 years, that is, the world has got a little bit warmer, although not as warm as it has been in Medieval times, or the Bronze Age.","The general trend in the last 4,000 years is that carbon dioxide and temperature have been moving against each other.","I gained a first class degree in Physics at Imperial College London in 1968 and did research in solid state physics, but did not pursue meteorology matters until gaining an M.Sc. in astrophysics from Queen Mary College London in 1981, after which I investigated and attempted to construct theories of solar activity.","The weather records of the U.S.A. are the best kept and most accessible in the world, thanks to consistent government/military taxpayer support. There are longer European data sets, but the U.S.A. data is enough to forecast major extreme events.","The key thing to understand is that solar activity causes shifts in the jet stream with consequent changes in weather patterns and triggers processes that lead to storm formation."],"Piers Morgan":["There is a certain advantage to the British accent. I do notice that Americans love it; they think the we Brits are smarter than perhaps we are.","Most of the men that sue in Hollywood are all about 5' 2'. They wake up every day, know they're tiny and feel very angry about it, so they go out and sue people.","There are many different ways of categorizing news. It doesn't have to be just war and famine and serious politics.","I want to interview the most important people in the world and have everyone in America the next day going, 'Did you see that?'","There is a type of snobbish, pompous journalist who thinks that the only news that has any validity is war, famine, pestilence or politics. I don't come from that school.","Bill O'Reilly is like a comfortable pair of shimmeringly angry slippers, but you know every night what you're going to get."],"Piet Mondrian":["Everything is expressed through relationship. Colour can exist only through other colours, dimension through other dimensions, position through other positions that oppose them. That is why I regard relationship as the principal thing.","We need words to name and designate things. But we have only a static language with which to express ourselves.","Just as pure abstract art is not dogmatic, neither is it decorative.","Art is the path to being spiritual.","Reality only appears to us tragical because of the disequilibrium and confusion of its appearances.","It is not important to make many pictures but that I have one picture right.","To move the picture into our surroundings and give it real existence has been my ideal since I came to abstract painting.","Experience was my only teacher; I knew little of the modern art movement. When I first saw the works of the Impressionists, van Gogh, van Dongen, and Fauves, I admired it. But I had to seek the true way alone.","I want to abolish time, especially in the contemplation of architecture.","I do not know how I shall develop, but for the present, I am continuing to work within ordinary, generally known terrain, different only because of a deep substratum, which leads those who are receptive to sense the finer regions.","Subjectivity ceases to exist only when the mutation-like leap is made from subjectivity to objectivity, from individual existence to universal existence.","The rhythm of relations of color and size makes the absolute appear in the relativity of time and space.","I think that the destructive element is too much neglected in art.","Things are beautiful or ugly only in time and space. The new man's vision being liberated from these two factors, all is unified in one unique beauty.","If the universal is the essential, then it is the basis of all life and art. Recognizing and uniting with the universal therefore gives us the greatest aesthetic satisfaction, the greatest emotion of beauty.","The desire for freedom and equilibrium (harmony) is inherent in man (due to the universal in him).","We must look not to the negative (the misery, the bestial in life), although we undergo it and sympathize with it, but rather to the burgeoning life around us, which is strengthened by the negative.","One can rightly speak of an evolution in plastic art. It is of the greatest importance to note this fact, for it reveals the true way of art - the only path along which we can advance.","Let us note that art - even on an abstract level - has never been confined to 'idea'; art has always been the 'realized' expression of equilibrium.","All individual thought is dissolved in universal thought, as all form is dissolved in the universal plastic means of Abstract-Real painting.","I came to the destruction of volume by the use of the plane. This I accomplished by means of lines cutting the planes. But still, the plane remained too intact. So I came to making only lines and brought the colour within the lines. Now the only problem was to destroy these lines also through mutual oppositions.","The position of the artist if humble. He is essentially a channel.","Dance, theatre, etc. as art, will disappear along with the dominating 'expression' of tragedy and harmony: the movement of life itself will become harmonious.","Only conscious man can mirror the universal: he can consciously become one with the universal and so can consciously transcend the individual.","I am only satisfied insofar as I feel 'Broadway Boogie Woogie' is a definite progress, but even about this picture I am not quite satisfied. There is still too much of the old in it.","If the paying public demands naturalistic art, then an artist can use his skills to produce such pictures - but these are to be clearly distinguished from the artist's own art.","Intuition enlightens and so links up with pure thought. They together become an intelligence which is not simply of the brain, which does not calculate, but feels and thinks.","The positive and negative states of being bring about action. They cause the loss of balance and of happiness. They cause the eternal revolutions - the changes that follow one upon the other. They explain why happiness cannot be achieved in time.","Many appreciate in my former work just what I did not want to express, but which was produced by an incapacity to express what I wanted to express - dynamic movement in equilibrium. But a continuous struggle for this statement brought me nearer. This is what I am attempting in 'Victory Boogie Woogie.'","It has become progressively clearer that the plastic expression of true reality is attained through dynamic movement in equilibrium. Plastic art affirms that equilibrium can only be established through the balance of unequal but equivalent oppositions.","The clarification of equilibrium through plastic art is of great importance for humanity. It reveals that although human life in time is doomed to disequilibrium, notwithstanding this, it is based on equilibrium. It demonstrates that equilibrium can become more and more living in us.","The most advanced minds as well as the least advanced are obliged to use the same words. If we adopt new words, it will be even more difficult - if not impossible - to make ourselves understood. The new man must therefore express himself in conventional language.","The meaning of words has become so blurred by past usage that 'abstract' is identified with 'vague' and 'unreal,' and 'inwardness' with a sort of traditional beatitude... The conception of the word 'plastic' has also been limited by individual interpretations.","The spiritual (i.e. the supersensory) has many degrees; thus, the term 'spiritual' is used both for the scale of degrees away from the physical towards the spirit, but also only for the spiritual proper.","I began as a naturalistic painter. Very quickly I felt the urgent need for a more concise form of expression and an economy of means. I never stopped progressing toward abstraction.","By turning from the surface, one comes closer to the inner laws of matter, which are also the laws of the Spirit.","All that is base in the masses is temporary, no doubt serving only to prevent evolution (that of the elite, as well) from proceeding too quickly and thus not becoming 'reality.'","The natural does not have to be a specific representation. I am now working on a thing which is a reconstruction of a starry sky, yet I make it, nevertheless, without a given in nature.","Whoever says he is starting from a given in nature may be right, and so is he who says he is starting from nothing!","True Boogie-Woogie I conceive as homogeneous in intention with mine in painting: destruction of melody, which is the equivalent of destruction of natural appearance, and construction through the continuous opposition of pure means - dynamic rhythm.","Non-figurative art is created by establishing a dynamic rhythm of determinate mutual relations which excludes the formation of any particular form.","As tradition, the female element clings to the old art and opposes anything new - precisely because each new art moves further away from the natural appearance of things.","Through the very culture of representation through form, we have come to see that the abstract - like the mathematical - is actually expressed in and through all things, although not determinately.","The artist sees the tragic to such a degree that he is compelled to express the non-tragic.","The subjectivization of the universal in art brings the universal downward on one hand, while on the other it helps raise the individual toward the universal."],"Pieter Zeeman":["The magnetic cleavage of the spectral lines is dependent on the size of the charge of the electron, or, more accurately, on the ratio between the mass and the charge of the electron.","Had we really succeeded therefore in altering the period of vibration, which Maxwell, as I have just noted, held to be impossible? Or was there some disturbing circumstances from one or more factors which distorted the result?","We studied the light source in the direction of the magnetic force, we perforated the poles of the magnet; but even in the direction of the magnetic lines of force we found that our result was confirmed.","The rotation of the polarization plane is extraordinarily small in all gases, thus also in sodium vapour.","On the basis of Lorentz's theory, if we limit ourselves to a single spectral line, it suffices to assume that each atom (or molecule) contains a single moving electron.","Now if this electron is displaced from its equilibrium position, a force that is directly proportional to the displacement restores it like a pendulum to its position of rest.","Now all oscillatory movements of such an electron can be conceived of as being split up into force, and two circular oscillations perpendicular to this direction rotating in opposite directions.","Nature gives us all, including Prof. Lorentz, surprises. It was very quickly found that there are many exceptions to the rule of splitting of the lines only into triplets.","Moreover, photography has made it possible to fix these images and now provides us with a permanent record of each observed spectrum, which can be measured out at any time.","It was not simply out of a spirit of contradiction that I exposed a light source to magnetic forces. The idea came to me during an investigation of the effect discovered by Kerr on light reflected by magnetic mirrors.","In the absence of a magnetic field the period of all these oscillations is the same. But as soon as the electron is exposed to the effect of a magnetic field, its motion changes.","I should point out, however, that at first some difficulty was experienced in observing the phenomena predicted by the theory, owing to the extreme smallness of the variations in the period of oscillation.","I count myself fortunate to be able to contribute to this work; and the great interest which the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has shown in my work and the recognition that it has paid to my past successes, convince me that I am not on the wrong track.","According to well-known electrodynamic laws, an electron moving in a magnetic field is acted upon by a force which runs perpendicular to the direction of motion of the electron and to the direction of the magnetic field, and whose magnitude is easily determined."],"Pietro Aretino":["I am, indeed, a king, because I know how to rule myself.","I love you, and because I love you, I would sooner have you hate me for telling you the truth than adore me for telling you lies.","I keep my friends as misers do their treasure, because, of all the things granted us by wisdom, none is greater or better than friendship.","I am a free man. I do not need to copy Petrarca or Boccaccio. My own genius is enough. Let others worry themselves about style, and so cease to be themselves. Without a master, without a model, without a guide, I go to work and earn my living, my well-being and my fame.","A high heart ought to bear calamities and not flee them, since in bearing them appears the grandeur of the mind and in fleeing them the cowardice of the heart.","With a goose-quill and a few sheets of paper, I mock myself of the universe.

He's going to be the leader of the whole Western world, you know?

Wow, that's original. Know what I mean?","When you watch the films that I'm inspired by - from the '60s and '70s - it's not about the special effects: it's about the story; it's about characters and relationships.","If it was up to me, we would eliminate close-ups and beautiful light and sound - because we want to go back to basics.","I used to read reviews - I read a lot of the reviews when I did 'Borgen,' but the thing is, people were so harsh that I talked to my wife about it, and I said this is too tough - the people are too personal and too idiotic to understand it, in my mind.","I don't know - the whole leading man, I don't buy it.","The leading character isn't always the most important or interesting character; when people think that the protagonist is the character portrayed, it's people who haven't read Shakespeare.","On 'Ghost In The Shell,' I'm looking forward more to working with Scarlett Johannson and Rupert Sanders than portraying a lead!","As a private person, I am maybe more 'Eurovision' than Kasper Juul.","I'm trying to have a family and a career.","I'm a father first.","Films come and go.

I love that it's so unpredictable.","I think all interesting characters have some kind of a complex.","For me, it's very important that the people I'm working with are feeling happy.","Honestly, I think it's kind of corny to sit and watch your own work.","With 'A Hijacking' I didn't talk to anyone who had been hijacked, but with 'A War,' I talked to as many soldiers as possible trying to understand how is it in Afghanistan.","In 'A Hijacking,' the characters are low-status people.","It was great fun being part of a TV series that I'd been a fan of for five years. I've been watching it every single Monday when with my wife.

The laws of the country are not subject to the Koran.","If you allow immigrants into your country, then you're responsible for them.","Animal welfare must be a priority, and we need to switch to less industrial production methods.","I have no desire to go through the emancipation of women and homosexuals all over again."],"Pina Bausch":["I'm not interested in how people move, but what moves them.","I want to feel something, as a person. I don't want to be bored.","When I first began choreographing, I never thought of it as choreography but as expressing feelings. Though every piece is different, they are all trying to get at certain things that are difficult to put into words. In the work, everything belongs to everything else - the music, the set, the movement and whatever is said.","Everything must come from the heart, must be lived.","It was not like I planned even to be a choreographer. It just happened to me somehow.","What I try to do is find a language for life."],"Pindar":["The best of healers is good cheer.","Whatever is beautiful is beautiful by necessity.","Learn what you are and be such.","Seek not, my soul, the life of the immortals; but enjoy to the full the resources that are within thy reach.","Every gift which is given, even though it be small, is in reality great, if it is given with affection.","A graceful and honorable old age is the childhood of immortality.","The test of any man lies in action.","The days that are still to come are the wisest witnesses.","Even wisdom has to yield to self-interest.","Great deeds give choice of many tales. Choose a slight tale, enrich it large, and then let wise men listen.","Not every truth is the better for showing its face undisguised; and often silence is the wisest thing for a man to heed.","Men are the dreams of a shadow.","The present will not long endure."],"Pinetop Perkins":["I play blues old-timey style.","I grew up hard. I picked cotton and plowed with the mule and fixed the cars and played with the guitar and the piano.","What I learned I learned on my own. I didn't have much school. Three years.","I taught myself off records, Memphis Slim, them old piano players, then added to it. Yeah, hard and loud, beat it to pieces.","What little family I got is in Mississippi. A whole lot of them died before I left, and my sister died a long time ago, before my mama did.","I play any piano with a good tune."],"Pink":["You can't move mountains by whispering at them.","Once you figure out what respect tastes like, it tastes better than attention. But you have to get there.","My dad raised me with some good advice: 'Always tell the truth. Always shoot from the hip. You might not have many friends, but you'll never have enemies, because people will always know where you're coming from.'","The willow is my favorite tree. I grew up near one. It's the most flexible tree in nature and nothing can break it - no wind, no elements, it can bend and withstand anything.","Sometimes I wish I was poetic and subtle. I write very bold and blunt and tell it like it is.","I know my strong points: I work hard, I have talent, I'm funny, and I'm a good person.","'Sexy' doesn't have to come with the price tag of being dumb.","I just get bored easily. As I'm sure other people do too.","When you have a dark side, nothing is ever as good as it seems.","I read all the time. I love it. My fantasy would be to be locked into a library. I'd be very, very happy.","Loads of my friends are lesbians, and it really annoys me that gay people aren't allowed to get married in most parts of America. I'd go on a march for gay rights any time.","The aggressive side of me comes across in my music, but I'm just a sweet girl.","Women have fought so long and hard for our rights and equality, and now all our attention is put on being a size 0.","I like feeling strong. It keeps my mental floor higher.","My mom took all of my behavior personally. Everything I did, she thought it was an act of rebellion against her. But it was just me being me.","Every album, I'm worried that I'm a dork and a fraud - 'What if I can't sing anymore?' Then I stop thinking and start playing guitar, and I realize that it's okay to suck, and move forward.","I'm very involved with PETA - People for Ethical Treatment of Animals - and Greenpeace and a lot of women's shelter and clothing giveaways.","I wanted to do it my way with my career, and I had this arrogant notion that people weren't just interested in my music but me as a person. That was my bit of arrogance, I guess. That's something I learned from Madonna. I was a fan right from the first time I heard 'Holiday.'","Consumerism diverts us from thinking about women's rights, it stops us from thinking about Iraq, it stops us from thinking about what's going on in Africa - it stops us from thinking in general.","For me, there is only love and fear.","Cutting, and suicide, two very different symptoms of the same problem, are gaining on us. I personally don't know a single person who doesn't know at least two of these victims personally.","Pink is what I do. Alecia is who I am. The world has taken Pink and turned it into this thing, a brand - a snarl.","A lot of people have problems with public confrontation, but it doesn't worry me at all. I can handle myself. I know my martial arts.","I have no idea why anyone likes me! I am very polarizing. It's either absolutely love or absolutely can't-be-around-for-more-than-three-seconds.","I was extreme... from skateboarder to hip-hopper to rave child to lead singer of a rock band - I did it all, and all at the same time.","I love the shows that are in dingy little dark clubs, smoky, no production whatsoever.","Beautiful has never been my goal.","I've always loved to prove people wrong. I want to be able to cross color lines, because in music, there really is no barrier.","Sage is cleansing and sacred.","I'm an asthmatic. I have to be on that treadmill singing to get my lungs right.","I was a very defensive kid 'cause I was really sensitive underneath and didn't want people to know. So I came off as very tough and very angry.","I want art to make me think. In order to do that, it may piss me off, or make me uncomfortable. That promotes awareness and change, or at least some discussion.","I'm very much in the trenches, and I don't live in the lap of luxury. I come from a working-class military family. We watch the news and read the paper and vote, so there's always something to be upset about. I always have a certain amount of angst in my back pocket.","I've always felt like the underdog, and I'm comfortable with that label.","Long-term relationships are an everyday choice. It's harder to be in a marriage than it is to bounce from one relationship to the next.","I feel like I 'get' boys. I've always been a boy's girl. Boys are easy; they just break stuff.","I write from my life, my experience. I'm selfish that way.","There's always a backlash when you challenge people's convictions and their heroes.","Having a child is the best thing that could happen.","I'm kind of psychotic and I like to talk about things. I'm a Virgo, too, so I like to analyze and overprocess.","Big productions, to me, are great - like, I love going to Vegas and seeing shows - but I think that sometimes it's distracting, especially when you are there to listen to the music.","I think you learn more about yourself in the context of a relationship than you can outside of it.","I'm taking my rats. Those are my friends for the tour. Thelma and Louise. They're so cute.","Cameron Diaz was so cute at the MTV Movie Awards when she pulled her skirt up and wiped her armpits.","I change my mind so much I need two boyfriends and a girlfriend.","For the first few years we paid all the bills first and divided what was left as salary. Sometimes that was $50 a week.","Today, charting your own course isn't just more necessary than ever before. It's also much easier - and much more fun.","The only problems I've ever had with being honest is telling people how I feel about them or saying how I feel about other people.","I've learned I'm not lying by not saying anything, so I just don't say it anymore.","I decided at 15 that I didn't want to be one of those artists that gets up and sings love songs they don't mean. I decided that I was going to be me to the fullest extent, that my songs were going to reflect relationships I've had, things I've been through, and even the stuff I'm embarrassed about.","I have to speak for myself. As far as videos go - casting, the artwork, everything - I'm completely hands-on. You have to be if you want your points across.","People are always so surprised when they meet me. Firstly, that I'm 'so tiny', and secondly that I'm 'so sweet'. They seem surprised that they're not scared of me.","I have never really encountered anybody that was rude to me. Well, not to my face anyway.","My favorite books, art pieces, films, and music, always have something jarring about them.","I'm never the kind of person who's sitting at home reading the charts and basing how I feel about myself or even my career on stats. I've always based it on, 'Am I doing the best that I can do?'","I've been asked to do 'American Idol' and 'X Factor.' I'm an Ed McMahon kind of girl. 'Star Search?' I'm in, all day long. It felt more authentic, and the market wasn't oversaturated with karaoke contests.","Gymnasts are short, stocky, muscular powerhouses.","I sing my life. It's like I'm having group therapy 350 days a year, and the people who come to the show get that, and they're there for that - whether it's to be lifted up, or to be lifted out, or just entertained or inspired, or to feel not so alone.","My stage show is raw and unpredictable.","There's something about breaking up with someone - you just look hotter than you ever did before.","My parents divorced, and I didn't have much of a daddy growing up.","I live in America. I love being an American.","There are 50 new tabloids every year, and I'm in them, and I read them, and I do stupid things.","I always wrote poetry as a teenager and it was always so dark, but it made me feel good to get it out.","Record companies, I found out, can put out compilations without your permission.","In the late '90s, R&B was dominant in the radio, and the white kids were taking it mainstream.","I don't like working with hitmakers. I don't want hits! You're not even allowed to say that word around me.","When I'm on tour, I'm in really good shape. When I get home, I cook, I eat, I get fat and happy.","My mom has always wished me a daughter just like me.","My mom never wanted to be a grandmom. She never wanted to be a mom, really.","I'd love to have time to do my hair, honestly. I'd love to be Victoria Beckham just for one day - to look that good. But I can't.","I don't live in the Hollywood bubble. I never have and I never will.","I was brought up to question authority, and thank God for that.","I'm such a control freak, and it's very hard for me to lose my inhibitions without something chemical inside me.","The whole 'sell out' word to me is such a tired, tired word.","When I first appeared, people couldn't figure out whether I was gay, straight, black, white or whatever, and I loved that. I loved the fact it scares people."],"Piper Laurie":["The fact is, I never wanted to be a movie star.","I never forget, remember that. Not an action, not a name, not a face.","Back then, everyone was Lana and Rock. No one had ethnic names.","I've always felt robbed of something by people not knowing I was a Jew.","I dropped the script in the fireplace, called my agent and said, they can jail me, sue me, but I'm never acting again, unless I can do something worthwhile.","I was so flattered to be asked to be in the movies - the idea of being paid to act was heady stuff.","I'm one of those people who has always been a bridesmaid.","And if real life was like the movies, I should have lived happily ever after.","Believe me, when an actress is told that her very name is synonymous with bad acting, she's had it.","One thing is certain. The old Piper Laurie is no more.","It took a long time, but I have learned that you just can't take anything you want out of life without putting something back in exchange.","And even then when you take it, you've got to take it with your whole heart."],"Piper Perabo":["There's no changing your mind about whom you love. That's part of the tough thing about being in love - it's sort of undeniable.","I really like to just jump in a truck with your backpack and just drive and go somewhere.","In Texas it's always hot, dry, sunny, not a cloud in the sky.","I don't know how you get dressed if you live in Wales, because it's pouring rain and then it's hot sunshine, and then it might hail. It's just so confusing.","It takes a lot of guts to get up on top of a bar and dance.","Let me tell you who I am: I'm a girl from New Jersey who moved to New York and worked in a bar while trying to make a living at what I really wanted to do, which was act.","It was so much fun to play, that I've now had a taste for it and want to play more villains now.","But at school, I wasn't athletic, and if you're not athlete in high school, it's kind of hard to find your place, so play practice seemed perfect, especially if you were as uncoordinated as I was.","I live not too far from it in New York City.","I was bookish and dorky in high school, so the best part of this movie was getting to be on the other side.","I was never the girl who walked down the centre of the hallway snapping people out of her way.","In Wales, it's eight different weathers in a day.","So I started to learn guitar right away.","I had just done what she does in the story just about a year earlier - I moved from New Jersey and came to New York and was working at a bar, and you know, trying to make it.","So it was just funny to read a script that was just similar to what had been going on in my life.","I went to college in Ohio, at Ohio University, and I graduated two years ago.","I can only pay my electric bill for my last two years on my acting.","I mean, its hard to be an actor in the city - trying to make it as an actor - because you waitress all night, you get home really late and you're super tired and your feet hurt.","I got lost a lot, and I was a really bad waitress... I got lost on the subway.","She tries to get a waitressing job for a while - I mean, she's looking for a while before she finds Coyote Ugly - and it's hard to get a waitressing job in the city.","There are a lot of people who wait tables. And especially because you can do it at night and you can do your work in the day, she and I had a very similar experience.","It's like a blind turn on a highway: You can't see what's coming, so you don't really know how to prepare.","I've never been one for sitting on beaches.","What I'd really like to do is do a film or two a year and then do theater in New York the rest of the year.","Nobody got Punk'd and he was still in his season for that show when we were filming. So the kids were very aware that it was filming and that was his show and they were very much on the lookout for that.","Well, usually when I finish one character, I'm looking for a role that's really different.","I can understand in some sense, having played the character, how unimaginably frustrating it is for people to tell you that you can't love who you love, because you ain't going to change it, and so they have to get out of your way.","But Paulie gives all of herself away, and so to create a love like that and a person who would give themselves away was what I thought was going to be difficult. I was little scared of such a challenge.","That's what I think we're all looking for - an honest love wherever you can find it.","I think that you love who you love, and there are people who you love that people aren't going to understand why, and that sort of doesn't really matter.","Well, love is confusing at all ages, but especially when you're 17.","I'm not lost, they just moved my street.","You can only really open yourself up so far to someone that you don't truly love - you keep something back when you know somewhere in your gut that this relationship is going to be forever."],"Pippa Evans":["Until I was about 14, I was a fat boy, or at least I looked like a fat boy. I think that being funny was a bit of a defence mechanism for me, so I ended up being a bit of a joker.","I told the ambulance men the wrong blood type for my ex, so he knows what rejection feels like.","I don't know if I was funny as a child, though I always thought my parents really enjoyed listening to me sing.","Health food shops can make people feel very important; it's like a brand new religion with people trying to convert you to quinoa.","A problem shared is attention gained.","I was a precocious child.","The strangest thing about writing a sitcom, is never knowing if it will become anything but words on a page.","I knew 'Be Our Guest' would be performed on a set and in costume, but anyone with a history in Theatre In Education will know that can mean anything.","If you had of told me age 10 that in 19 years time I would be on a stage in Salford performing with Les Dennis in a sitcom I had written, I would have believed you.","You get very comfortable doing the open mic circuit, turning up to the same places and playing to 20 people. In that situation, it won't matter if you aren't great on that night because no one will really remember who you are. Then suddenly you are doing rooms to 400 people and you have to up your game."],"Pippa Middleton":["I remember the noise of the bells ringing at school as the effigy of Guy Fawkes we'd prepared earlier was carried out on a canvas stretcher, hoisted on to the huge bonfire and set alight. Then the revelry would begin. My school friends and I would all have sparklers we passed around, lighting one from another.","There is no real need for decorations when throwing a barbecue party - let the summer garden, in all its vibrant and luscious splendour, speak for itself.","It's a bit startling to achieve global recognition before the age of 30 on account of your sister, your brother-in-law and your bottom. One day I might be able to make sense of this. In the meantime I think it's fair to say that it has its upside and its downside.","When hosting a party, move any clutter from the space where you're entertaining.","I certainly have opportunities many can only dream of - but in most ways I'm a typical girl in her 20s trying to forge a career and represent herself in what can sometimes seem rather strange circumstances. One of the most attractive has been the chance to publish 'Celebrate.'","As a child, I felt that Hallowe'en was a time when creatures of the night suddenly came to life - we would turn off all the lights in the house and let flickering candlelight conjure up scary shadows and create the effect of imaginary figures lurking in dark corners.","I have finally perfected my signature. It took hours of practicing... I decided early on just to write Pippa, not Middleton.","I can assure you that it feels even stranger to me than it probably does to you to have seen so much written about me when I have done so little to paint a picture of myself.","I just feel really fortunate to build a career as a writer.","I'm a real foodie.","When I was a child, my December weekends were spent making cards, decorating the tree, hanging the wreath and preparing brandy butter and peppermint creams.","Turkeys are perfect for feeding larger gatherings.","My interest in food really began with a month's cookery course in Frome, Somerset, after my A-levels. I left the course not an incredible cook, alas, but a real enthusiast. Food and cooking is at the core of entertaining, and my passion grew and grew.","Why not collect and clean chicken wishbones in the run-up to Christmas, spray them silver and use each to pinch together a white hem-stitch napkin?","'Celebrate' is meant to be a guide to party planning and, as such, it has to cover the basics. If I were to write a cookery book, for instance, I would be compelled to say that, to make an omelette, you have to break at least one egg. Actually, that's not a bad idea. Or maybe I should write a sequel and call it 'Bottoms Up?'","My father has developed a tradition of surprising us at some point by appearing in fancy dress. He buys a new costume each year and typically gets carried away. A couple of Christmases ago he appeared in an inflatable sumo outfit. It's endearing, really, and only quite embarrassing.","Entertaining on any scale can be stressful and daunting.","As I have found out, recognition has its upside, its downside and - you may say - its backside."],"Pir Vilayat Khan":["In dream consciousness... we make things happen by wishing them, because we are not only the observer of what we experience but also the creator.","A perfect human being: Man in search of his ideal of perfection. Nothing less."],"Pitbull":["If you continue to work hard, let that be the fuel to your fire.","I'm taking all the negatives in my life, and turning them into a positive.","You can't get much whiter than me.","I won't perform in Cuba until there's no more Castro and there's a free Cuba. To me, Cuba's the biggest prison in the world, and I would be very hypocritical were I to perform there.","In any country when you throw something in somebody's face, it's disrespectful.","I'm taking a lot of freestyle music and flipping it.","With all the negativity going on in the world right now, people need an escape. When you give them a hit record or a great record, it allows them to escape for at least three to four minutes. They're not thinking bills or economy or immigration or war when you create that kind of ambiance.","I work hard. But I play hard, too.","Every time I reach a new audience, that means I'm doing something right.","The people in Cuba, they know what I stand for, and there's a lot of people in Cuba that stand for the same. But they can't say it.","I already had three strikes against me. One, I have light skin. Two, I'm from Miami, which wasn't getting looked at at the time. Three, I'm Cuban. But now, I've made everything that stacked against me into a virtue.","I think of fans like a barbershop. I want that debate.","Look, Pitbull is a product.","I look at this game from a different perspective.","My owner is life and that's what I fight for.","I'm here to entertain.","I'm no longer an artist, I'm a business partner.","Any time I see anything moving onstage, I'm cautious about it.","This industry is 90 percent business, 10 percent talent.","When I get in the studio the idea is just to work and bang out as many as I can.","I grew up around salsa, merengue, bachata, bass music, freestyle, hip-hop, techno, house, rave.","As Americans, which I suffer from myself, we have ADD.","I feel like I've been fighting in music and creating new ways and new opportunities to make things work even when people thought it wouldn't.","Music to me is something I did as a hobby.","It's all about music, because music is basically what's... been my avenue out of maybe being involved in things I shouldn't be.","One night I'll be in Los Angeles and it'll be a Latin crowd, and then another night I'll go to Fresno and it'll be an all-black crowd. To me, that's the beauty of the music.","I like to keep my money at the end of the day.","Music is my hustle.","I'm in the major league now.","My kids can't eat awards.","I'm definitely someone who enjoys life and wakes up with a ball of energy.","I don't agree when the USA, that lives by a constitution, says, OK, just because you look this way, we're going to ask you for your documentation, or you gotta go back to your country.","I make music with no boundaries."],"Pixie Lott":["I'm a really bad liar. My mom finds out every time, especially now that she's got Facebook.","I long for the old days of Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn, stars who had real glamour and mystique. We only knew so much about their lives; the rest was a mystery.","I don't believe in open relationships. If you want to be with someone else, you shouldn't be in a relationship in the first place.","I like the big smoky eyes look, and I always do my eyes first when I'm putting on my make-up.","The worst thing about me is my toes. I've thick joints from wearing pointe ballet shoes - I went to a dance school from the age of 11 and danced every day.","I would really love to go to Thailand as so many people have told me how wonderful it is.","I just like boys who are good-looking, really! I like people who are tall with a good sense of style. My faves are the indie look, the smart look or the surfer look.","The paparazzi stuff is a little weird. I used to leave the house in my pajamas. I can't do that anymore, but I'm not complaining!","I like to mix it up, but I do like a lot of '60s fashion. But I like to make it a bit more edgier, sometimes a bit more rockier, sometimes a bit more classic.","I just always wanted to be a singer. My mom said I was even singing in my cot!","I take my inspiration for the song writing from little experiences, not even if I've experienced them myself but say if something has made me sad, I will use that emotion. I just use everyday life and write about it.","I don't do lies!","I love to have Heinz Salad Cream on all my food!","What's good is that my music is different from everyone else's. It's got the soul element, like Duffy, but it's not very retro. It's a contemporary, pop, fresh sound. That's what makes it different.","I always prefer to write songs about emotional situations and heartbreak because I like getting into the character.","I don't think I'd get caught up in the crazy side of the music industry because it's just not in my nature.","I'm not going to do anything that will damage my voice because my voice is my career and singing is my passion. I was singing in the cot and I'll still be singing when they're nailing down my coffin.","As a kid, I'd watch MTV and think how great it would be to have my own music videos on those shows. Now I turn on MTV and, along the bottom of the screen, it often reads, 'Coming next... Pixie Lott.' That's so strange that I can't even begin to make sense of it.","The biggest turn-off for me is people who think the world of themselves. Arrogance is not a sexy quality, and it really gets on my nerves.","I love dressing for the winter - especially in baggy chunky cardigans.","My two style icons are Edie Sedgwick and Brigitte Bardot.","My favourite designer is Mulberry - their bags are lovely, but their clothes are amazing, I don't think people realise. I love D&G, Fendi, Moschino, Chanel, Armani - all the classics!","When I was born, I was born very prematurely so I was very tiny and small. And so, my mom just nicknamed me Pixie, like a little fairy.","I've actually been compared to every female singer going from Britney, Christina, Mariah, Duffy, Amy Winehouse, everyone. And they are so different, so I think it's cool that people see me as so many different artistes but I think I'm a little different, yeah.","I always feel like I want to write a song when I'm really upset. And when I'm in an argument with my family, I go straight to the piano and just kind of take it out on the piano and get all emotional.","Hmm... my bedroom's really messy. It's probably the messiest bedroom you could ever think of. Like, you think it's messy, but when you go there, you can't see one bit of floor anywhere. Clothes, makeup... I'm getting sent loads of clothes and stuff, so it's just piling up everywhere. I've to jump over it in order to get into my bed.","I like to wear girlie things, but only if I can rock them up with biker boots or a jacket.","When I was younger I was really shy, but I'd always be singing, driving my family crazy. Apparently I was even singing when I was in the cot. That probably didn't sound too good!","I don't really follow any fashions. I just wear what I want to wear each day. I don't care if they clash or not.","I don't want to be one of those people who falls out of cabs drunk. But I don't want to be known as some boring girl who just sits at home and doesn't do anything.","Every time I get up and sing for people, I get such a high. I just want to do it again and again.","I can't imagine ever not making music, making albums, writing songs, doing shows. That's all I really know, and that's all I really do.","When I was growing up, I read Britney Spears' and Mariah Carey's biographies. I just wanted to see how they did it because I was so eager to get into the biz.","Every year since I was very small, my family - Mum, Dad, sister Charlie-Ann and brother Stephen - and I have been holidaying in Carvoeiro in the Algarve, so that has very fond memories for me.","I'm not afraid to use my personal experiences and put them into a song. I think that's when you get the best stuff anyway, when it's real emotion.","I knew I wanted to be a singer from the age of five. I've been lucky to be so single-minded - some of my friends still don't know what they want to do, and they're finding it hard. There are home videos of me singing and taking centre stage at family parties when I'm about three.","We all like music in my family, but I'm the only one who's made it my life.","I'm not afraid of hard work. I like it! It's the other bit - the not working - I find more problematic. If I'm not busy, I just get antsy. I've been this way since I was a child. Sitting still is like torture for me.","You won't see a picture of me rolling around in a gutter, but I sometimes have a photo taken when I'm leaving a club looking tired, and there'll be headlines saying, 'She's out of control'. You can't prepare yourself for those things; you just have to shrug them off.","I don't try to pretend to be what I'm not. I don't feel I need to do anything outrageous.","I find some really cool, unique stuff in vintage shops. The good thing about vintage if that it doesn't quite fit you can customise it, like, make it shorter. The shorter the better!","I've always loved '60s fashion; it's so sexy."],"Piyush Goyal":["The speed of decision making is the essence of good governance.","Electricity can transform people's lives, not just economically but also socially.","I like to set aggressive targets; without them, you will get ordinary performances.","Renewable energy is not more expensive than fossil fuel when you factor in life-cycle costs.","A visionary leadership is required to harness rapid technological change for positive benefit rather than allowing to become disruptive and further exacerbate economic inequality.","Even a poor man doesn't ask alms unless he sees you have the ability to give.","Corruption is the by-product of discretion when there is scope for interpretation of policies.","Productive and sustainable job creation, along with increased and better-targeted social expenditure, are the only routes to permanently beat the poverty trap and to bring our social indicators on par with developed countries.","It's equal opportunity for all, and we don't play favourites.","I have told many times I am always a student willing to learn new things.","I can't tell my people that you will get power only from 6 A.M. to 5 P.M., and after that, we live in darkness. You need 24-hour power; you need a baseload, and that baseload for India is coal. We are looking at clean coal technologies to reduce the impact of pollution.","I do not think the Nobel institution gives you a certificate that everything you say is always right.","There is no room any more for the divisive agenda which has been sought to be foisted on the common man.","Anyone leaving the Congress' camp and joining - or even indirectly praising - the BJP-led NDA coalition immediately stands the risk of losing this Congress-issued certificate of secularism. It is a travesty!","India's infrastructure deficit in terms of roads, railways, power, and ports needs to be addressed on a fast-track basis.","Reforms ensure that everybody benefits and the state generates financial resources to provide for the really deserving.","Use of energy-efficient LEDs, pumps, fans, and air-conditioners will save power consumption and reduces the peak load.","We can learn from all around the world. Germany, particularly, has been successful with rooftop solar generation. Other countries like Norway and Sweden have done work on it. Some of them have done offshore wind projects. So we're looking at learning from the best from all across the world. My approach is to get the best out of each one.","Solar growth will support landowners to derive income and solar industry to build their business.","Politics is involved when you don't tackle inefficiency and burden people with higher tariffs.","My solar energy programme alone will generate about a million jobs.","I believe if we simplify the process of tariff-fixing with lesser tariff slabs and rationalise the process, it will reduce corruption, and simultaneously, it will enable supply of adequate and cheap power to the poor as well as to farmers.","I am a person always with an open mind.","I am a happier person living in a country which has surplus of everything rather than shortages.","Of course we have to use coal... the renewable energy sources will supplement the supply from coal.","In New York, lights are on the whole night; there are offices where not a single person is working, but all lights are on. The street lights at the White House are lit all the day. Why? And we are being told not to use coal.","People of India deserve to be complimented for making the 2014 elections a referendum on the misrule of the Congress-led UPA and demonstrating their faith in a proven new leadership.","I am an optimist.","In most riots in India, Congress has had a direct or indirect involvement.

This will also reduce the electricity bills of people.","You only expect something from somebody you have confidence can deliver.","I don't interfere with regulators.","You can't sell thermal power without the competitive bidding.","India has been developing its green energy resources.","We have been working towards providing a clean environment to the people of India, and we are doing it out of our own conviction.","Unless you empower your domestic investor and domestic industry and domestic confidence in the sector, no foreigner is going to come.","Cost-plus is an inefficient way to do things.","Very often, state utilities do not buy electricity even if they need it, as every unit purchased increases their losses.","Allocating coal linkage to a generating company rather than to a specific plant gives companies the freedom to use the fuel in the most efficient way.","States are the architects of UDAY, not the central government.","Transparency is the hallmark of Prime Minister Modi's government.","I don't want projects to take 10 years to set up.

We can have better roads, healthcare, education, and improve the life of farmers.","If inflation is brought down, interest rates will fall. Once rates fall, we have the opportunity to maybe achieve the goal of 'housing for all' faster; take roads, infrastructure to India's interiors.","More taxes mean more money to spend for public welfare.","Gujaratis are smart people.","The Gujarat government knows what's in the interest of consumers. When they plan, they ensure they can save every single rupee or earn every single rupee for the state government and bring power at lowest cost to the consumer. They are tightfisted in their approach.","I can't inject renewables into a grid that doesn't have base load.","When a product is market driven, it should be able to pay for all its raw materials at market prices.","For me, as the Government of India, the interest of the poorest of the poorest is paramount.","The Modi government believes that the industrialist, the capitalist, has to pay for the assets of the government which belong to the people of India.","My father studied under a street light in a small town in Haryana.","I trust the regulatory mechanism; it is a fair and independent mechanism, and the politicians and government do not interfere with the regulators.","24/7 power is going to happen; it is not a question of possible or impossible.","I don't get carried away by any praise; I know I have miles to go.","When you give a good offer, people take it.","Prime Minister Modi keeps challenging the system to keep performing better and better. He sets aggressive targets, and the whole system has to act.","People have seen the Modi government's track record, and now they believe that if we say something, it will happen.","I am a tough minister.","Energy is not a political issue for the Modi government. It is our commitment to provide electricity to every household of the country.","Power for all includes people who are interested in getting a connection. It cannot be for people who don't want the connection. Having said that, I am confident everybody will apply for power once they are sure that they will not be short-charged.","PM Modi has provided visionary leadership with his focus on the welfare of the poor and inclusive nature taking along his whole team, including states, parties, all schools of thought, all sections of society.","Foreign and domestic investors will come only when they know that you have enough power.","Extra capacity makes manufacturing competitive, keeps pricing in control.","When PM goes for a foreign visit, he represents a country and not the party.","I believe investigative agencies should be run in an autonomous manner, and there shouldn't be any interference from the government's side.","The 100 gigawatt target for solar should not be a constraint. India won't stop at 100 GW.","We need to draw up a regime where government can be an enabler for manufacturing to compete at good quality and prices.","Western countries have gone through their development cycle and enjoyed the fruits of ruining the environment over many years and are now giving us homilies and pontificating on responsibilities to the environment. I think they need to look inward.","I am still fairly confident we will come out better than the West in terms of our overall development versus damage.","I'm not crying over surplus capacity... Surplus capacity is good for India. Surplus capacity means we can get more investors, can get more households and promise them 24/7 power.","I have very often held a view - and I am public about it - that if you run your operations inefficiently, you can't expect your consumer to pay for your inefficiencies.","As more and more money is coming into the formal economy, one can look at more attractive tax rates and lower tax slabs. Even if half the people who were in the informal sector move in to the formal economy and more taxes get collected, more money can be spent on the welfare.","We cannot have a system that everything can be passed on to the final consumer in the garb of cost being recovered without being sensitive to their own problems and affordability.","Ramifications of small decisions can be pretty large.","Centrally, I cannot interfere in states.","I will reach out to all states uniformly... I can assure you I will take two steps for every step they extend.","I am very friendly with the people of India, and corporates are also a part of that.","Indians have become very demanding. Gone are the days where you could get away with power outages.","UDAY is meant for financial and operational turnaround of discoms.","I can't tell the people of India that we'll burden you with high costs because the West has polluted the world, now India will pay for it. Not acceptable to us.","India doesn't take responsibility for the problems that the world is facing because of thermal coal.","Our pollution out of carbon emissions is still very, very low compared to the world.","I want to reignite the interest in hydro-electric investments.","Western countries can cut down coal and replace it by renewables; I will need to have more coal.","I feel there is huge potential for India and the U.K. to work together both on the technology space and on the investment space.","If you are moving the informal economy into the formal economy, and if the transactions which for years were never reported as part of GDP are now transacted through banking channels, it will only add to the GDP, not reduce the GDP.","Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, we are looking to make India self-reliant in terms of power requirement, along with providing carbon-free sources of power, thus improving India's position globally.","Wind developers have realised the importance of transparent method of price discovery, which was demonstrated in the solar sector. They realise that bidding brings in efficiency, and tariff is right-sized.","You have to decide that you will be the best.","You can fool the people once, twice, but you can't fool them all the time.

I carved out a niche with the Wagnerian repertoire since I am attracted by its theatrical intensity.","Should it happen tomorrow, I would fall to my knees to give thanks to God for such a career.","The public made me and then encouraged me for many years, and my future even now depends upon it.","The public is a part of my real life.","But I won't deprive myself of singing opera as long as my voice follows.","I will prove that a great conducting career is expecting me.","I have always studied my parts with the orchestral score and not with the piano reduction.","I feel at home in an orchestral score.","The atmosphere of the theater is my oxygen.","My strength is my enthusiasm.","The press regularly proclaims my ambitions and my financial demands.","Let us be clear: I take ten times more money for a concert than for an opera performance.","This season, over eight productions, I am presenting four young tenors.","When a young artist is ready, one has to bring him into the limelight.","Young singers are much better educated musically, much better informed, through discs and videos, than I was.","I attended less than two years of Conservatory in Mexico City.","I was married at 16, a father at 17 and divorced at 18.","It is strange, but nobody is shocked when pop singers make a fortune in the space of two years."],"Plato":["Wise men speak because they have something to say; Fools because they have to say something.","Music is a moral law. It gives soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and charm and gaiety to life and to everything.","Human behavior flows from three main sources: desire, emotion, and knowledge.","A good decision is based on knowledge and not on numbers.","Thinking: the talking of the soul with itself.","Music is the movement of sound to reach the soul for the education of its virtue.","Let parents bequeath to their children not riches, but the spirit of reverence.","Ignorance, the root and stem of all evil.","For good nurture and education implant good constitutions.","The beginning is the most important part of the work.","Opinion is the medium between knowledge and ignorance.","The greatest wealth is to live content with little.","Love is a serious mental disease.","This City is what it is because our citizens are what they are.","The measure of a man is what he does with power.","Dictatorship naturally arises out of democracy, and the most aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme liberty.","We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.","There are three classes of men; lovers of wisdom, lovers of honor, and lovers of gain.","Good people do not need laws to tell them to act responsibly, while bad people will find a way around the laws.","No evil can happen to a good man, either in life or after death.","There are two things a person should never be angry at, what they can help, and what they cannot.","Man - a being in search of meaning.","A hero is born among a hundred, a wise man is found among a thousand, but an accomplished one might not be found even among a hundred thousand men.","Every heart sings a song, incomplete, until another heart whispers back.

At the touch of a lover, everyone becomes a poet.","One of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics is that you end up being governed by your inferiors.","We are twice armed if we fight with faith.","There will be no end to the troubles of states, or of humanity itself, till philosophers become kings in this world, or till those we now call kings and rulers really and truly become philosophers, and political power and philosophy thus come into the same hands.","Better a little which is well done, than a great deal imperfectly.","For a man to conquer himself is the first and noblest of all victories.","Honesty is for the most part less profitable than dishonesty.","If a man neglects education, he walks lame to the end of his life.","To be sure I must; and therefore I may assume that your silence gives consent.","Cunning... is but the low mimic of wisdom.","When men speak ill of thee, live so as nobody may believe them.","Courage is knowing what not to fear.","People are like dirt.

But as an artist, as a portrait photographer, my job is to tell the truth and to capture someone's spirit on a certain day. And it's never the whole truth; it's the truth I experience in a very intense and intimate fashion.","People are at their best when they can be natural. And that's the hardest thing as a photographer.","I always wanted to be the underdog. For me, as a portrait photographer, it's the kiss of death to become well known. I did my best work when no one knew who I was. People weren't threatened by me because they didn't think I was a big deal.","Perhaps the most important people that I should photograph are the people who don't have a voice.","Mugabe had a very strange quality about him. He was dapper. He had the strangest skin - it looks very shiny, but it's not oily. It's stretched very finely over his flesh. His eyes have layers of cyan crystals in them. It was a quiet, dark moment when I took his picture.","I am not a photojournalist and certainly not used to the Jason Bourne type stuff that some photographers have to deal with.","My father is an architect, so I often think like a designer or an architect. I remember when I was admiring buildings, I would look up at them and see this perspective and this awesome power of the monument in front of me.","Photography can be a volatile situation. It can be very potent.","I never think about a shoot before I do it. Because there's no formula for people. What I try to do is to strip everything away rather than go in with preconceived notions. If I do that, I might miss a gem or a jewel that the person is offering me.","It's very intimidating to be photographed, but if I kneel down and chat with you, so you're looking down at me, it makes you feel less threatened.","I've always had a healthy disregard for authority - it allows me to do my job as a portrait photographer and not as someone who is playing the power game.","I'm not a politician or a scholar or political historian. I'm just a photographer who's trying to capture a spirit.

Few had financial worries due to large incomes and little taxes.","Of course, Hollywood is still making some excellent pictures which reflect the great artistry that made Hollywood famous throughout the world, but these films are exceptions, judging from box office returns and press reviews.","I then remained in Berlin until Dec. 1938, spending my time between pictures at my villa on the Riviera.","I agree with Marjorie Rosen's good psychological analysis of my acting ability.","Alas, in 1929 came the Stock Market crash and everything changed and became worrisome. People started practicing conservatism because of financial losses, myself included."],"Poliana Okimoto":["Pool swimmers are very slim, and they're stronger. Marathon swimmers have to train an awful lot, and they end up losing a bit of muscle mass. So we need to have a bit more fat, though that's not the case with me. Many swimmers have a little bit of extra fat though, so that they can deal with the cold and get through what is an exhausting event.","The difference between the swimming marathon and the pool events is mainly down to the weather. Nature always gives us external factors to deal with.","I think marathon swimming makes you work more on your upper body, your abdomen, trapezius, and your arms. When you finish a race, your arms and abdomen are more tired than your legs. Your legs are tired because you've just sprinted for the line, but at the end of the race, when you start to relax, it's your arms that hurt.","With marathon swimming, I think you have to use your head more than you do in pool events, which are more automatic. You can just go out and replicate your training pace in competition. With the marathon, though, you have to contend with nature, physical contact, and time."],"Polly Bergen":["I'm one of those people who always needs a mountain to climb. When I get up a mountain as far as I think I'm going to get, I try to find another mountain.","The thing is, when you see your old friends, you come face to face with yourself. I run into someone I've known for 40 or 50 years, and they're old. And I suddenly realize I'm old. It comes as an enormous shock to me.","Baltimore is one of the most beautiful towns, really. And trust me, I don't say that about every place. There is just something so quaint, old and beautiful about this place.","I came to Southbury because I wanted to live a more simple life. When I was a child, I saw lots of movies about happy people living in Connecticut. And ever since then, that was where I wanted to live. I thought it would be like the movies. And it really is. It's exactly what I hoped it would be.","I always said, 'A blind dog with three legs could get a standing ovation for singing 'I'm Still Here!'","As soon as my foot is in the light onstage, I am home. It is what I love to do. It is what I have always loved to do.","It suddenly struck me - I'm 70 years old. I wonder if I could possibly end my life the way I started it: doing the most joyful thing I ever did, which is to sing.","I started having a lot of problems with my voice in my mid-30s.","The interesting thing about me is that I was born poor, and I've lived rich and I've lived poor, and I know how to do both. People think rich is better. I don't know.","You look at the road you could have taken, you know, I just think that's interesting... I've been on a lot of roads and I had to hitchhike on a couple of 'em... I have to be very honest: There's not an awful lot of regret in my life. I think that, you know, you learn from everything, and then, sometimes, you don't.","When I was young, they just gave me the lead. And when I got old, they wouldn't see me at all.","I was fanatically ambitious. All I ever wanted was to be a star. I didn't want to be a singer. I didn't want to be an actress. I wanted to be a star.","The secret I've lived by ever since I started earning money is this: Always buy a house with an extra bedroom adjoining the master. And that's always my closet."],"Polly Berrien Berends":["The gain is not the having of children; it is the discovery of love and how to be loving.","Parenthood always comes as a shock. Postpartum blues? Postpartum panic is more like it. We set out to have a baby; what we get is a total take-over of our lives.","A sense of worthiness is a child's most important need.","The parent is the strongest statement that the child hears regarding what it means to be alive and real. More than what we say or do, the way we are expresses what we think it means to be alive. So the articulate parent is less a telling than a listening individual.","We can see that the baby is as much an instrument of nourishment for us as we are for him.","Most of us would do more for our babies than we have ever been willing to do for anyone, even ourselves.","My list of things I never pictured myself saying when I pictured myself as a parent has grown over the years."],"Polly Toynbee":["Happiness is a real, objective phenomenon, scientifically verifiable. That means people and whole societies can now be measured over time and compared accurately with one another. Causes and cures for unhappiness can be quantified.","One in six people suffer depression or a chronic anxiety disorder. These are not the worried well but those in severe mental pain with conditions crippling enough to prevent them living normal lives.","People want the right to die at a time of their own choosing. Too many families have watched helplessly as a relative dies slowly, longing for death.","Could a government dare to set out with happiness as its goal? Now that there are accepted scientific proofs, it would be easy to audit the progress of national happiness annually, just as we monitor money and GDP.","But how odd that in this heathen nation of empty pews, where churches' bare, ruined choirs are converted into luxury loft living, a Labour government - yes, a Labour government - is deliberately creating a huge expansion of faith schools.","It is now possible to quantify people's levels of happiness pretty accurately by asking them, by observation, and by measuring electrical activity in the brain, in degrees from terrible pain to sublime joy.","Crime is only the worst example, but it is a paradigm for other Labour policy disasters. No one tells the voters that crime is falling: let them stay scared senseless.","But the single overwhelming reason why jails are bursting is longer sentences given for more crimes.","So what really works? Treatments in jail do some good, but it's mostly too late: finding a family and a job or just growing older make most prisoners eventually give up crime.","Is anyone serious about the politics of happiness? David Cameron dipped a toe in the water, using the word lightly, but denying the hard policies it implies. Labour shies away from it, but should take up the challenge.","The strongest predictor of unhappiness is anyone who has had a mental illness in the last 10 years. It is an even stronger predictor of unhappiness than poverty - which also ranks highly.","Working lives are for the state to influence. Unemployment makes people unhappy. So does instability.","Inequality makes everyone unhappy, the poor most of all, and that is well within the remit of the state. More money gives less extra happiness the richer we get, yet we are addicted to earning and spending more every year.","My Lords temporal, today is the day to rise up against the regiment of Lords spiritual and proclaim the values of enlightenment, compassion and common sense.","In the polls, over 80% support the right to die and have done for the last 25 years. Even 80% of practising Catholics and Protestants support it, plus 76% of Church Times readers.","Most people come to fear not death itself, but the many terrible ways of dying.","The best care on earth cannot prevent us all dying in the end.","Thresholds of pain, indignity and incapacity are entirely personal.","Openness about death has led to greater care about all aspects of dying.","My mother begged doctors to end her life. She was beyond the physical ability to swallow enough of the weak morphine pills she had around her. When she knew she was dying I promised to make sure she could go at a time of her choosing, but it was impossible. I couldn't help.","How do you make any sense of history, art or literature without knowing the stories and iconography of your own culture and all the world's main religions?","There is all the difference in the world between teaching children about religion and handing them over to be taught by the religious.","This is indeed a clash of civilisations, not between Islam and Christendom but between reason and superstition.","But instead of standing up for reason, our government is handing education over to the world of faith."],"Polly Walker":["Sometimes Italian fashion, especially in the summer, is bright and gaudy and tarty, so I'd be buying these bright pink and bright orange things, and when I got home, I'd just go, 'What was I thinking? I can't wear this!'","I love cooking. People seem to enjoy my food, but I absolutely love it. I'm one of those people who will buy a cookery book and take it to bed and read it.","If I wasn't an actress, I'd like to cook. I'm pretty obsessed by it. Rome was great in that sense, going to amazing cookery bookshops. No wonder their food is good because the quality and wide range of their produce is so good. It's not fair, really.","I was married to an Italian, and my son was born there. I've got lots of connections there, and I lived in the north, in the country about an hour outside of Milan, for quite a few years. I speak fluent Italian."],"Pollyanna Chu":["As a general rule, I am very passionate about any business that I engage in.","When I came back to Hong Kong in 1992, I decided to pursue a new career challenge.","In our eyes, the success of Franck Muller and Sincere is synonymous.","Franck Muller has been very supportive during our acquisition process.","Taking a backseat role is not in my nature."],"Polybius":["For the mob, habituated to feed at the expense of others, and to have its hopes of a livelihood in the property of its neighbors, as soon as it has got a leader sufficiently ambitious and daring, being excluded by poverty from the sweets of civil honors, produces a reign of mere violence.","Those who know how to win are much more numerous than those who know how to make proper use of their victories."],"Polykarp Kusch":["To those of you who study history, economics, sociology, literature and language I present the challenge of the utilization of the enormous resources in our grasp to the problem of creating a genuinely good life for yourselves and your children.","No single achievement in science is possible without the painstaking work of the many hundreds who have built the foundation on which all new work is based.","The destiny of our society is yours to make and you have a vastly greater importance to the world than we do.","The increase of scientific knowledge lies not only in the occasional milestones of science, but in the efforts of the very large body of men who with love and devotion observe and study nature.","I count myself fortunate to be able to participate in the life of science in this era.","I feel, sometimes, as the renaissance man must have felt in finding new riches at every point and in the certainty that unexplored areas of knowledge and experience await at every turn.","If, on occasion, the knowledge brought by science leads to an unhappy end, this is not to the discredit of science but is rather an indication of an imperfect ability to use wisely the gifts placed within our hands.","Indeed science alone may perhaps be sterile when pursued without an understanding of the world in which scientific knowledge is created and in which the fruits of science are used.","Science is the greatest creative impulse of our time. It dominates the intellectual scene and forms our lives, not only in the material things which it has given us, but also in that it guides our spirit.","Science shows us truth and beauty and fills each day with a fresh wonder of the exquisite order which governs our world.","The knowledge and understanding of the world which science gives us and the magnificent opportunity which it extends to us to control and use the world for the extension of our pleasure in it has never been greater than it now is.","We live, I think, in the century of science and, perhaps, even in the century of physics."],"Pom Klementieff":["There are so many forms of love. Spending time with friends, love stories. I enjoy showing my love by baking a cake for somebody and writing his or her name on it, and seeing his or her reaction. I love to offer flowers, too!","Sometimes I like to be comfortable and wear black jeans with a blazer, a really comfortable t-shirt, and low boots with heels. Sometimes I like to be feminine and preppy.","Being resilient is the essence of my life.","I always loved the Marvel movies. It was my dream to one day have superpowers, and that came true.","In life, I have male friends. They're just friends, and there's nothing going on, and it's beautiful.","It felt like a pretentious fantasy to say, 'I want to be an actress.'","It's crazy that, as women, we are taught to be cute and nice and polite when we should learn to be less nice sometimes.","In everyday life, I use positive thoughts, sense of humor, Taekwondo, running, and yoga to make me stronger.","I never believed in God, and I will never believe in it.","My mom named me Pom because she said it sounded like a combination of Korean words that mean 'spring' and 'tiger.' So, it's very unique!","I would love to be the lead in an action movie. I would love to be like Emily Blunt in 'Edge of Tomorrow.'","Oh, my gosh! Can you imagine learning boxing from Sylvester Stallone's character? I would die!","I'll be at the airport, and people will say, 'Mantis!' and I'm like, 'Wait! How do you know I'm here?' It's just crazy.","I love to create looks. It's just like you're a different character every day.","I think it's important to show that... you can't be perfect, and you have to embrace the fact that you're original, and it's what makes you interesting."],"Pontius Pilate":["Ye have a watch; go your way, make it as sure as ye can.","I am innocent of the blood of this just person; see ye to it.","Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people; and behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him.","What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?","Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?","Art thou the King of the Jews?","Whether will the twain will ye that I release unto you?","What shall I do then with Jesus, which is called Christ?","Answerest thou nothing? Behold how many things they witness against thee.","Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?"],"Pontus Hulten":["Paris is an ideal place to become informed, while Venice is a place to think and write.","Tinguely wasn't the first artist to work with machines. But others were more interested in precision, in what machines are meant to do. What made him different was the random element. He introduced the mechanical accident. He was always interested in the immaterial, in sound, smoke, speed, light, shadows.","The bohemian life that reigned in Paris until the end of the '50s is gone. The artists had more time to think, to reflect; success didn't come so suddenly.","American museums have become cautious, because it is very hard to get money to do something different or controversial."],"Pooch Hall":["Rapping for me is more about being entertaining and giving something back to the fans. I want people to say, 'There goes Pooch holding his own with Consequence, Rick Ross, and Drake.'","I'm not ashamed; I work hard to look how I do.","I'm trying to get my next job as a biracial action hero.","I don't want to disrespect hip-hop by being something I'm not. I'm Pooch Hall. My strength is in front the camera and holding dialogue.","However people feel about Kanye is their opinion, but I think he's a genius.","I think athletically I can be okay with any role, but I'm willing to go over and beyond for my work. My fan base is so strong and loyal, and they wanna see me evolve. I'm where I'm supposed to be and I want to challenge myself with the people that are doing it real big."],"Pooja Hegde":["I see travelling as a great learning process, and my biggest dream is to travel the world.","As a person, I am someone who wants to give my the best in every take. I wouldn't say it was easy for me to get into the industry because I come from a background where no one has been in films. But I do believe if you work hard, you will get noticed. Modeling gave me that courage to stand in front of the camera.","I felt like an ugly duckling back in school. I was a complete tomboy with short hair. Never in my dreams did I imagine that I would walk the ramp with 6-inch heels. My friends can't believe that I'm an actor, because I was such an introvert in school.","Bengaluru is home for me. Being from Udupi, Karnataka, I have many relatives in Bengaluru. I used to come down for Bangalore Fashion Week. It was a lot of fun, and I had made so many good friends.","I got into the industry after Miss India, but I actively started modeling in 2010. I never even dreamed that a simple girl like me could act, let alone become an actress. Slowly, as I started giving acting a shot, I realised how much I enjoyed it and how happy it makes me.","Besides acting, I love reading books, dancing, singing, and following a few sports. My favorite sport is tennis. I love travelling, and I see a new place every year. Luckily, my job helps me do that very easily. In my spare time, I also spend time watching English TV shows like 'Grey's Anatomy,' 'Modern Family,' 'House MD' and a few others.","I love Madhuri Dixit, Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence, Leonardo Di Caprio, and Sandra Bullock.","I come from a middle-class South Indian family, and we speak Tulu at home. I never led a lavish life, and I have my feet on the ground.","When I was young, for some reason, I thought a postman's job was quite cool, and once, I even contemplated becoming a lawyer. Finally, I decided to dabble in something creative like fashion designing or photography. Till I joined college, I had no clue that one day, I will face the camera.","Back in school, there was this guy who had a huge crush on me. One day, when he mustered the courage to propose to me on a Rose Day, my friends burst out laughing right in front of him. I'm sure we all have had such experiences, and I've had crushes in the past. Right now, all I can think about is my films and deliver my best.","I feel I am blessed. So many actresses went without doing a period film in their career, and I got a chance to do one in my first film.","I am born and brought up in Mumbai. I have grown up watching Hindi films. So I belong here, I feel.","I want to explore a new place each year, and it can be within India. When I was shooting for 'Mohenjo Daro', I couldn't travel out of the country for two years. But it gave me an opportunity to explore new places within India. I'm sure there are so many places to explore in India, and I would love to go there.","I saw singer Pink doing aerial flips during one of her performances at Grammy Awards. It got me inspired, and I started doing it, too. It has made me very flexible. I couldn't even touch my toes a few years ago, but now I find myself to be extremely fit.","I am bound by a contract to not accept other films until 'Mohenjo Daro''s release.","I really miss working in Telugu and Tamil. Fans there adore you.","When 'Mohenjo Daro' came to me, I decided to go by my gut instincts. If something big comes up, you need to give it that time and effort.","If my mom came to the sets, we would speak to her in Tulu, and no one would understand. That's an advantage when you know any South Indian language.","You can't do anything about a film's fate at the box office.","Women-centric films are being made, and they are doing well.","The fact that I have done films down South didn't boost or hamper my chances here. In fact, I was still shooting for both my Telugu films when I met Ashu sir for 'Mohenjo Daro.' During the audition, he gave me five scenes with lengthy dialogues. Once I cleared them, he gave me a song to dance to. So, my Bollywood entry was no cakewalk.","As far as the type of movies I am offered is concerned, it's a mix. I have been offered both period films and the regular fare."],"Poorna Jagannathan":["I find myself changing my entire lifestyle every three years or so, and I'm comfortable in being an outsider. I have grown up like that.","I've always wanted to be an actor, but I didn't know how to become one.","I think the best thing I ever did was never tell anyone I wanted to be an actor. I find if you tell people what you're dreaming about, they'll usually come up with lots of reasons to not chase your dreams.","The first time my parents found out I was acting was when a friend told them they had just come back from a play I was in."],"Pope Benedict XVI":["God does not change; he is Love, ever and always. In himself, he is communion, unity in Trinity, and all his words and works are directed to communion.","Not all moral issues have the same moral weight as abortion and euthanasia. There may be legitimate diversity of opinion even among Catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty, but not... with regard to abortion and euthanasia.","The Church is not self-made, it was created by God and is continuously formed by Him. This finds expression in the Sacraments, above all in that of Baptism: I enter into the Church not by a bureaucratic act, but with the help of this Sacrament.","To me, it really seems visible today that ethics is not something exterior to the economy, which, as technical matter, could function on its own; rather, ethics is an interior principle of the economy itself, which cannot function if it does not take account of the human values of solidarity and reciprocal responsibility.","Prudence does not mean failing to accept responsibilities and postponing decisions; it means being committed to making joint decisions after pondering responsibly the road to be taken.","True friends challenge us and help us to be faithful on our journey.","I would say that normally it is the creative minorities that determine the future, and in this sense, the Catholic Church must understand itself as a creative minority that has a heritage of values that are not things of the past, but a very living and relevant reality.","All the great works of art, the cathedrals - the Gothic cathedrals and the splendid Baroque churches - are a luminous sign of God, and thus are truly a manifestation, an epiphany of God.","The church is not a political power; it's not a party, but it's a moral power.","An important function of theology is to keep religion tied to reason and reason to religion. Both roles are of essential importance for humanity.","The Eucharistic sacrifice of the body and blood of Christ embraces in turn the mystery of our Lord's continuing passion in the members of his mystical body, the church in every age.","We have to see that the human person needs the infinite. If God's not there, if the infinite isn't available, the human person creates its own paradises, giving the appearance of 'infinitude' that can only be a lie.","The reality of the Eucharistic sacrifice has always been at the heart of Catholic faith; called into question in the 16th century, it was solemnly reaffirmed at the Council of Trent against the backdrop of our justification in Christ.","God of peace, bring your peace to our violent world: peace in the hearts of all men and women and peace among the nations of the Earth.","Choose the path of dialogue rather than the path of unilateral decisions.","We are moving toward a dictatorship of relativism which does not recognize anything as for certain and which has as its highest goal one's own ego and one's own desires.","Having a clear faith, based on the creed of the church is often labeled today as fundamentalism. Whereas relativism, which is letting oneself be tossed and swept along by every wind of teaching, look like the only attitude acceptable to today's standards.","The Gospel purifies and renews: it bears fruit wherever the community of believers hears and welcomes the grace of God in truth and lives in charity. This is my faith; this is my joy.","It is very important for a priest, in the parish itself, to see how people trust in him and to experience, in addition to their trust, also their generosity in pardoning his weaknesses.","The truth touches us. We try to be guided by this contact.","Down through the centuries, the Czech Republic, the territory of the Czech Republic has been a place of cultural exchange.","Artificial intelligence, in fact, is obviously an intelligence transmitted by conscious subjects, an intelligence placed in equipment. It has a clear origin, in fact, in the intelligence of the human creators of such equipment.","I would say it simply: No one can give that which he doesn't personally possess, which means we cannot transmit the Holy Spirit in an effective way, render the Spirit perceptible, if we ourselves aren't close to the Spirit.","Above all, we must have great respect for these people who also suffer and who want to find their own way of correct living. On the other hand, to create a legal form of a kind of homosexual marriage, in reality, does not help these people.","Human rights, of course, must include the right to religious freedom, understood as the expression of a dimension that is at once individual and communitarian - a vision that brings out the unity of the person while clearly distinguishing between the dimension of the citizen and that of the believer.","An Adult faith does not follow the waves of fashion and the latest novelties.","We must respect the interior laws of creation, of this Earth, to learn these laws and obey them if we want to survive.","Celibacy is not a matter of compulsion. Someone is accepted as a priest only when he does it of his own accord.","I would like everyone to feel loved by the God who gave his son for us and showed us his boundless love. I want everyone to feel the joy of being Christian.","Every State has the primary duty to protect its own population from grave and sustained violations of human rights, as well as from the consequences of humanitarian crises, whether natural or man-made.","Our Earth is talking to us, and we must listen to it and decipher its message if we want to survive.","In the 20th century, in the darkest period of German and European history, an insane racist ideology, born of neopaganism, gave rise to the attempt, planned and systematically carried out by the regime, to exterminate European Jews. The result has passed into history as the Shoah.","A just laicism allows religious freedom. The state does not impose religion but rather gives space to religions with a responsibility toward civil society, and therefore it allows these religions to be factors in building up society.","Dear brothers and sisters, after the great Pope John Paul II, the cardinals have elected me - a simple, humble worker in the vineyard of the Lord.","The wrath of God is a way of saying that I have been living in a way that is contrary to the love that is God. Anyone who begins to live and grow away from God, who lives away from what is good, is turning his life toward wrath.","Standards of conduct appropriate to civil society or the workings of a democracy cannot be purely and simply applied to the Church.","Liberty isn't liberalism, arbitrariness, but it's connected; it's conditioned by the great values of love and solidarity and in general by the good.","Both need each other: The agnostic cannot be content to not know, but must be in search of the great truth of faith; the Catholic cannot be content to have faith, but must be in search of God all the time, and in the dialogue with others, a Catholic can learn more about God in a deeper fashion.","In our heart, in the heart of each of you, let there be always the joyous certainty that the Lord is near, that he does not abandon us, that he is near to us, and that he surrounds us with his love.","Loving the church also means having the courage to make difficult, trying choices, having ever before oneself the good of the church and not one's own.","We pray that the Lord may help us to produce His light in ourselves, even in dark days, so that we might be light for others, illuminating the world and life in this world.","Those who love desire to share with the beloved. They want to be one with the beloved, and Sacred Scripture shows us the great love story of God for his people which culminated in Jesus Christ.","God guides his church, maintains her always, and especially in difficult times. Let us never lose this vision of faith, which is the only true vision of the way of the church and the world.","The fact that the church is convinced of not having the right to confer priestly ordination on women is now considered by some as irreconcilable with the European Constitution.","I don't know if the term 'liberation theology,' which can be interpreted in a very positive sense, will help us much. What's important is the common rationality to which the church offers a fundamental contribution, and which must always help in the education of conscience, both for public and for private life.","The Church must introduce the individual Christian into an encounter with Jesus Christ and bring Christians into His presence in the sacrament.","The family unit is fundamental for the educational process and for the development both of individuals and states; hence there is a need for policies which promote the family and aid social cohesion and dialogue.","If it is true that the great missionaries of the 16th century were convinced that one who was not baptized was lost - and that explains their missionary commitment - in the Catholic Church after the Second Vatican Council, that conviction was definitely abandoned.","I wrote the text of the resignation. I cannot say with precision when, but at the most two weeks before. I wrote it in Latin because something so important you do in Latin. Furthermore, Latin is a language in which I know well how to write in a more appropriate way.","I too hope in this short reign to be a man of peace.","For me, it's a great joy to be together with priests: in the end, the bishop of Rome is the bishop and brother of all priests. His mandate is to confirm the brothers in the faith.","It's a great responsibility before God, the judge who guides us, who draws us to truth and good, and in this sense the church must unmask evil, rendering present the goodness of God, rendering present his truth, the truly infinite for which we are thirsty.","Faith is not a product of reflection, nor is it even an attempt to penetrate the depths of my own being.","We all see that, today, man can destroy the foundation of his existence: his Earth.","The principle of tolerance and respect for freedom promoted by the reforms of the Second Vatican Council are today being manipulated and erroneously taken too far.","You can't talk about what you haven't felt.","I realized that everything I had to do I could not do on my own, and so I was almost obliged to put myself in God's hands, to trust in Jesus who - while I wrote my book on him - I felt bound to by an old and more profound friendship.","The traditional teaching of the church has proven to be the only failsafe way to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.","The counterweight to the dominion of evil can consist in the first place only in the divine-human love of Jesus Christ that is always greater than any possible power of evil.","Attempts to construct an ethic from the rules of evolution, or from psychology and sociology, end up being simply inadequate.","If we may not remain silent about evil in the Church, then neither should we keep silent about the great shining path of goodness and purity which the Christian faith has traced out over the course of the centuries.","It is of great concern that the fabric of African life, its very source of hope and stability, is threatened by divorce, abortion, prostitution, human trafficking, and a contraception mentality.","Today, I, too, wish to reaffirm that I intend to continue on the path toward improved relations and friendship with the Jewish people, following the decisive lead given by John Paul II.","On the one hand, faith is a profoundly personal contact with God, which touches me in my innermost being and places me in front of the living God in absolute immediacy in such a way that I can speak with Him, love Him, and enter into communion with Him.","The fact that the Lord can work and act even with insufficient means consoles me, and above all I entrust myself to your prayers.","We must have great respect for these people who also suffer and who want to find their own way of correct living. On the other hand, to create a legal form of a kind of homosexual marriage, in reality, does not help these people.","Our Christian conviction is that Christ is also the messiah of Israel. Certainly it is in the hands of God how and when the unification of Jews and Christians into the people of God will take place.","Although the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin, it is more or less strong tendency ordered to an intrinsic moral evil, and thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder.","To me, its seems necessary to rediscover - and the energy to do so exists - that even the political and economic spheres need moral responsibility, a responsibility that is born in man's heart and, in the end, has to do with the presence or absence of God.","We can learn from him that suffering and the gift of himself is an essential gift we need in our time.","The Christian faith can never be separated from the soil of sacred events, from the choice made by God, who wanted to speak to us, to become man, to die and rise again, in a particular place and at a particular time.","The real 'action' in the liturgy in which we are all supposed to participate is the action of God himself. This is what is new and distinctive about the Christian liturgy: God himself acts and does what is essential.","The Cross is the approbation of our existence, not in words, but in an act so completely radical that it caused God to become flesh and pierced this flesh to the quick; that, to God, it was worth the death of his incarnate Son.","Today we bury his remains in the earth as a seed of immortality. Our hearts are full of sadness, yet at the same time of joyful hope and profound gratitude.","The abuse of faith has to be resisted precisely.","I leave from where the apostle arrived.","The new pope knows that his task is to make the light of Christ shine before men and women of world - not his own light, but that of Christ.","Art is elemental. Reason alone as it's expressed in the sciences can't be man's complete answer to reality, and it can't express everything that man can, wants to, and has to express. I think God built this into man. Art along with science is the highest gift God has given him.","When the danger is great, one must not run away.","If a Pope clearly realizes that he is no longer physically, psychologically, and spiritually capable of handling the duties of his office, then he has a right and, under some circumstances, also an obligation to resign.","The Lord has placed next to me many people, who, with generosity and love for God and the church, have helped me and been close to me.","If we look to the saints, this great luminous wake with which God has passed through history, we truly see that here is a force for good that survives through millennia; here is truly light from light.","The outpouring of Christ's blood is the source of the church's life.","How much we need, in the church and in society, witnesses of the beauty of holiness, witnesses of the splendour of truth, witnesses of the joy and freedom born of a living relationship with Christ!","Since politics fundamentally should be a moral enterprise, the church in this sense has something to say about politics.","In Latin America in general, it's very important that Christianity not be simply a thing of reason, but also of the heart.","Each generation, as it seeks to advance the common good, must ask anew: 'What are the requirements that governments may reasonably impose upon citizens, and how far do they extend? By appeal to what authority can moral dilemmas be resolved?'","The Catholic tradition maintains that the objective norms governing right action are accessible to reason, prescinding from the content of revelation.","In the name of freedom, there has to be a correlation between rights and duties, by which every person is called to assume responsibility for his or her choices, made as a consequence of entering into relations with others.","The life of the community, both domestically and internationally, clearly demonstrates that respect for rights, and the guarantees that follow from them, are measures of the common good that serve to evaluate the relationship between justice and injustice, development and poverty, security and conflict.","I no longer wield the power of the office for the government of the church, but in the service of prayer I remain, so to speak, within St. Peter's bounds. St. Benedict, whose name I bear as pope, shall be a great example in this for me. He showed us the way to a life which, active or passive, belongs wholly to the work of God.","We have to pay attention to developing well, in the correct manner, the human aspects also in the professions, in respect of other persons, in being concerned for others, which is the best way of being concerned for ourselves.","A form of reason that in some way wished to strip itself of beauty would be diminished; it would be a blinded reason.","This obedience to the voice of the Earth is more important for our future happiness... than the desires of the moment.","The hatred and contempt for men, women and children that was manifested in the Shoah was a crime against God and against humanity.","Germany has an established and well-furnished Catholicism, often with employed Catholics who handle the church like a labor union. For them, the church is simply the employer.","In the harshness of the world of technology - in which feelings do not count anymore - the hope for a saving love grows, a love which would be given freely and generously.","We need Grace and forgiveness.","Mercy is what moves us toward God, while justice makes us tremble in his sight.","For me, it is one of the 'signs of the times' that the idea of God's mercy is becoming increasingly central and dominant.","We let ourselves be molded and transformed by Christ and continually pass from the side of one who destroys to that of the one who saves.","A weak point of mine was maybe little resolve in governing and making decisions.","In reality, I am more a professor, one who reflects and mediates on spiritual questions. Practical governance is not my strong point, and this is certainly a weakness. But I do not see myself as a failure. For eight years, I carried out my work.","It is evident that the Church is always abandoning more the old traditional structures of European life and, therefore, is changing its appearance and living new forms in itself. It's clear most of all that the de-Christianization of Europe is progressing, that the Christian element is always vanishing more from the fabric of society.","Liturgy, in truth, is an event by means of which we let ourselves be introduced into the expansive faith and prayer of the Church. This is the reason why the early Christians prayed facing east, in the direction of the rising sun, the symbol of the returning Christ.","I use both the 'I' and the 'we.' For on many, many matters, I am not simply expressing ideas that have happened to occur to Joseph Ratzinger, but I am speaking out of the common life of the Church's communion.","Today we have to learn all over again that love for the sinner and love for the person who has been harmed are correctly balanced if I punish the sinner in the form that is possible and appropriate.","The prevailing mentality was that the Church must not be a Church of laws but, rather, a Church of love; she must not punish. Thus, the awareness that punishment can be an act of love ceased to exist. This led to an odd darkening of the mind, even in very good people.","At any rate, we can see that they are given into our care, that we cannot just do whatever we want with them. Animals, too, are God's creatures.","Certainly a sort of industrial use of creatures, so that geese are fed in such a way as to produce as large a liver as possible, or hens live so packed together that they become just caricatures of birds, this degrading of living creatures to a commodity seems to me in fact to contradict the relationship of mutuality that comes across in the Bible.","I would designate as science fiction in the best sense: they are visions and anticipations by which we seek to attain a true knowledge, but, in fact, they are only imaginations whereby we seek to draw near to the reality.","Where human lives are concerned, time is always short, yet the world has witnessed the vast resources that governments can draw upon to rescue financial institutions deemed 'too big to fail.'","There are those who would advocate that the voice of religion be silenced, or at least relegated to the purely private sphere.","There are those who argue that the public celebration of festivals such as Christmas should be discouraged, in the questionable belief that it might somehow offend those of other religions or none.","God does not become more divine when we push him away from us in a sheer, impenetrable voluntarism; rather, the truly divine God is the God who has revealed himself as logos and, as logos, has acted and continues to act lovingly on our behalf.","The positive aspects of modernity are to be acknowledged unreservedly: we are all grateful for the marvellous possibilities that it has opened up for mankind and for the progress in humanity that has been granted to us.","While we rejoice in the new possibilities open to humanity, we also see the dangers arising from these possibilities, and we must ask ourselves how we can overcome them.","God is not distant: he is 'Emmanuel,' God-with-us. He is no stranger: he has a face, the face of Jesus.","God in fact does not change: he is faithful to himself.","One sees in Latin America, and also elsewhere, among many Catholics a certain schizophrenia between individual and public morality.","We can see that the sacramental presence of the Lord in the Eucharist is an essential gift for us and give us also the possibility to love the others and to work for the others.","It is essential that God created men and women to be one, as it is said in the first chapters of the Bible. So I think even if our culture is against marriage as essential form of relations between human beings, between women and men. I think our nature is always present, and we can understand it if we will understand it.","It is absolutely important to make accessible the Gospel for all people and also understandable for Jewish people.","If the protection of the environment involves costs, they should be justly distributed, taking due account of the different levels of development of various countries and the need for solidarity with future generations.","The cardinals have elected me, a simple, humble worker in the Lord's vineyard.","The myth of my solitude makes me laugh.","The Church must actualize, be present in the public debate, in our struggle for a true concept of liberty and peace.","Interreligious dialogue in the strict sense of the term is not possible without putting one's own faith into parentheses.","My plans never progressed as far as a clear desire for a family.","It is important to learn to understand in a historical text, a text from the past, the living Word of God, that is, to enter into prayer and thus read Sacred Scripture as a conversation with God.","It is important to be in the 'we' of the Church, in the 'we' of the life of the Liturgy."],"Pope Francis":["Human rights are not only violated by terrorism, repression or assassination, but also by unfair economic structures that creates huge inequalities.","Even today we raise our hand against our brother... We have perfected our weapons, our conscience has fallen asleep, and we have sharpened our ideas to justify ourselves as if it were normal we continue to sow destruction, pain, death. Violence and war lead only to death.","Life is a journey. When we stop, things don't go right.","Although the life of a person is in a land full of thorns and weeds, there is always a space in which the good seed can grow. You have to trust God.","We must restore hope to young people, help the old, be open to the future, spread love. Be poor among the poor. We need to include the excluded and preach peace.","A little bit of mercy makes the world less cold and more just.","Abortion isn't a lesser evil, it's a crime. Taking one life to save another, that's what the Mafia does. It's a crime. It's an absolute evil.","Every man, every woman who has to take up the service of government, must ask themselves two questions: 'Do I love my people in order to serve them better? Am I humble and do I listen to everybody, to diverse opinions in order to choose the best path?' If you don't ask those questions, your governance will not be good.","Each of us has a vision of good and of evil. We have to encourage people to move towards what they think is good... Everyone has his own idea of good and evil and must choose to follow the good and fight evil as he conceives them. That would be enough to make the world a better place.","Find new ways to spread the word of God to every corner of the world.","Together with a culture of work, there must be a culture of leisure as gratification. To put it another way: people who work must take the time to relax, to be with their families, to enjoy themselves, read, listen to music, play a sport.","If one has the answers to all the questions - that is the proof that God is not with him. It means that he is a false prophet using religion for himself. The great leaders of the people of God, like Moses, have always left room for doubt. You must leave room for the Lord, not for our certainties; we must be humble.","A person once asked me, in a provocative manner, if I approved of homosexuality. I replied with another question: 'Tell me: when God looks at a gay person, does he endorse the existence of this person with love, or reject and condemn this person?' We must always consider the person.","This is important: to get to know people, listen, expand the circle of ideas. The world is crisscrossed by roads that come closer together and move apart, but the important thing is that they lead towards the Good.","We all have the duty to do good.","Instead of being just a church that welcomes and receives by keeping the doors open, let us try also to be a church that finds new roads, that is able to step outside itself and go to those who do not attend Mass, to those who have quit or are indifferent.","A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges is not Christian. This is not in the Gospel.","Grace is not part of consciousness; it is the amount of light in our souls, not knowledge nor reason.","Truth, according to the Christian faith, is God's love for us in Jesus Christ. Therefore, truth is a relationship.","From my point of view, God is the light that illuminates the darkness, even if it does not dissolve it, and a spark of divine light is within each of us.","Jesus teaches us another way: Go out. Go out and share your testimony, go out and interact with your brothers, go out and share, go out and ask. Become the Word in body as well as spirit.","There is a need for financial reform along ethical lines that would produce in its turn an economic reform to benefit everyone. This would nevertheless require a courageous change of attitude on the part of political leaders.","If investments in banks fall, it is a tragedy, and people say, 'What are we going to do?' but if people die of hunger, have nothing to eat or suffer from poor health, that's nothing.","This is me, a sinner on whom the Lord has turned his gaze. And this is what I said when they asked me if I would accept my election as pontiff. I am a sinner, but I trust in the infinite mercy and patience of our Lord Jesus Christ, and I accept in a spirit of penance.","Wretched are those who are vindictive and spiteful.","Let us all remember this: one cannot proclaim the Gospel of Jesus without the tangible witness of one's life.","I believe in God - not in a Catholic God; there is no Catholic God. There is God, and I believe in Jesus Christ, his incarnation. Jesus is my teacher and my pastor, but God, the Father, Abba, is the light and the Creator. This is my Being.","God never gives someone a gift they are not capable of receiving. If he gives us the gift of Christmas, it is because we all have the ability to understand and receive it.","Worshipping the Lord means giving Him the place that he must have; worshipping the Lord means stating, believing - not only by our words - that He alone truly guides our lives; worshipping the Lord means that we are convinced before Him that He is the only God, the God of our lives, the God of our history.","Money has to serve, not to rule.","You tell me: Can you live crushed under the weight of the present? Without a memory of the past and without the desire to look ahead to the future by building something, a future, a family? Can you go on like this? This, to me, is the most urgent problem that the Church is facing.","If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge? We shouldn't marginalise people for this. They must be integrated into society.","Christmas is joy, religious joy, an inner joy of light and peace.","You cannot be in a position of power and destroy the life of another person.","When I was a seminarian, I was dazzled by a girl I met at an uncle's wedding. I was surprised by her beauty, her intellectual brilliance... and, well, I was bowled over for quite a while.","Since many of you do not belong to the Catholic Church and others are non-believers, from the bottom of my heart I give this silent blessing to each and every one of you, respecting the conscience of each one of you but knowing that each one of you is a child of God.","We have observed that, in society and the world in which we live, selfishness has increased more than love for others, and that men of good will must work, each with his own strengths and expertise, to ensure that love for others increases until it is equal and possibly exceeds love for oneself.","Among us, who is above must be in service of the others. This doesn't mean we have to wash each other's feet every day, but we must help one another.","The Church is or should go back to being a community of God's people, and priests, pastors and bishops, who have the care of souls, are at the service of the people of God.","Sometimes negative news does come out, but it is often exaggerated and manipulated to spread scandal. Journalists sometimes risk becoming ill from coprophilia and thus fomenting coprophagia: which is a sin that taints all men and women, that is, the tendency to focus on the negative rather than the positive aspects.","I have a dogmatic certainty: God is in every person's life. God is in everyone's life. Even if the life of a person has been a disaster, even if it is destroyed by vices, drugs or anything else - God is in this person's life. You can - you must - try to seek God in every human life.","It is true that going out on to the street implies the risk of accidents happening, as they would to any ordinary man or woman. But if the church stays wrapped up in itself, it will age. And if I had to choose between a wounded church that goes out on to the streets and a sick, withdrawn church, I would definitely choose the first one.","God always has patience.","Right now, we don't have a very good relation with creation.","Agape, the love of each one of us for the other, from the closest to the furthest, is in fact the only way that Jesus has given us to find the way of salvation and of the Beatitudes.","Since God created the world, He also created reality.","Those who today always look for disciplinarian solutions, those who long for an exaggerated doctrinal 'security,' those who stubbornly try to recover a past that no longer exists - they have a static and inward-directed view of things. In this way, faith becomes an ideology among other ideologies.","My choices, including those related to the day-to-day aspects of life, like the use of a modest car, are related to a spiritual discernment that responds to a need that arises from looking at things, at people and from reading the signs of the times. Discernment in the Lord guides me in my way of governing.","Young people are just as attracted to the truth as they are convenience and expediency.","We cannot insist only on issues related to abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods. The teaching of the church is clear, and I am a son of the church, but it is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time.","We need to avoid the spiritual sickness of a church that is wrapped up in its own world: when a church becomes like this, it grows sick.","I am always wary of decisions made hastily. I am always wary of the first decision, that is, the first thing that comes to my mind if I have to make a decision. This is usually the wrong thing. I have to wait and assess, looking deep into myself, taking the necessary time.","Inconsistency on the part of pastors and the faithful between what they say and what they do, between word and manner of life, is undermining the Church's credibility.","Perhaps I can say that I am a bit astute, that I can adapt to circumstances, but it is also true that I am a bit naive. Yes, but the best summary, the one that comes more from the inside and I feel most true is this: I am a sinner whom the Lord has looked upon.","I am a sinner. This is the most accurate definition. It is not a figure of speech, a literary genre. I am a sinner.","The root of this possibility of doing good - that we all have - is in creation.","An example I often use to illustrate the reality of vanity, is this: look at the peacock; it's beautiful if you look at it from the front. But if you look at it from behind, you discover the truth... Whoever gives in to such self-absorbed vanity has huge misery hiding inside them.","When we walk without the cross, when we build without the cross and when we proclaim Christ without the cross, we are not disciples of the Lord. We are worldly. We may be bishops, priests, cardinals, popes, all of this, but we are not disciples of the Lord.","The Lord has redeemed all of us, all of us, with the blood of Christ: all of us, not just Catholics. Everyone! 'Father, the atheists?' Even the atheists. Everyone!","I see the church as a field hospital after battle. It is useless to ask a seriously injured person if he has high cholesterol and about the level of his blood sugars. You have to heal his wounds. Then we can talk about everything else.","Unrestrained liberalism only makes the strong stronger and the weak weaker and excludes the most excluded.","The confessional is not a torture chamber, but the place in which the Lord's mercy motivates us to do better.","These days there is a lot of poverty in the world, and that's a scandal when we have so many riches and resources to give to everyone. We all have to think about how we can become a little poorer.","I dream of a church that is a mother and shepherdess.","Despite the slowness, the infidelity, the errors and sins it committed and might still commit against its members, the Church, trust me, has no other meaning and goal but to live and witness Jesus.","Human self-understanding changes with time, and so also human consciousness deepens.","Vanity, showing off, is an attitude that reduces spirituality to a worldly thing, which is the worst sin that could be committed in the church.","I like it when someone tells me 'I don't agree.' This is a true collaborator. When they say 'Oh, how great, how great, how great,' that's not useful.","Politics is a noble activity. We should revalue it, practise it with vocation and a dedication that requires testimony, martyrdom, that is to die for the common good.","Worshipping is stripping ourselves of our idols, even the most hidden ones, and choosing the Lord as the centre, as the highway of our lives.","Sin, also for those who don't have faith, exists when one goes against one's conscience. To listen to and obey it means, in fact, to decide in face of what is perceived as good or evil. And on this decision pivots the goodness or malice of our action.","In our ecclesiastical region there are priests who don't baptize the children of single mothers because they weren't conceived in the sanctity of marriage. These are today's hypocrites. Those who clericalize the church. Those who separate the people of God from salvation.","I love tango, and I used to dance when I was young.","You might say, 'Can't we have a more human Christianity, without the cross, without Jesus, without stripping ourselves?' In this way we'd become pastry-shop Christians, like a pretty cake and nice sweet things. Pretty, but not true Christians.","To say that you can kill in the name of God is blasphemy.","The worship of the golden calf of old has found a new and heartless image in the cult of money and the dictatorship of an economy which is faceless and lacking any truly human goal.","There is a danger that threatens everyone in the church, all of us. The danger of worldliness. It leads us to vanity, arrogance and pride.","Religion has the right to express its opinion in the service of the people, but God in creation has set us free: it is not possible to interfere spiritually in the life of a person."],"Pope Gregory VII":["I have loved justice and hated iniquity: therefore I die in exile.","It is the custom of the Roman Church which I unworthily serve with the help of God, to tolerate some things, to turn a blind eye to some, following the spirit of discretion rather than the rigid letter of the law."],"Pope John Paul II":["Marriage is an act of will that signifies and involves a mutual gift, which unites the spouses and binds them to their eventual souls, with whom they make up a sole family - a domestic church.","An excuse is worse and more terrible than a lie, for an excuse is a lie guarded.","You will reciprocally promise love, loyalty and matrimonial honesty. We only want for you this day that these words constitute the principle of your entire life and that with the help of divine grace you will observe these solemn vows that today, before God, you formulate.","The future starts today, not tomorrow.","Have no fear of moving into the unknown. Simply step out fearlessly knowing that I am with you, therefore no harm can befall you; all is very, very well. Do this in complete faith and confidence.","Stupidity is also a gift of God, but one mustn't misuse it.","Freedom consists not in doing what we like, but in having the right to do what we ought.","Social justice cannot be attained by violence. Violence kills what it intends to create.","As the family goes, so goes the nation and so goes the whole world in which we live.","When freedom does not have a purpose, when it does not wish to know anything about the rule of law engraved in the hearts of men and women, when it does not listen to the voice of conscience, it turns against humanity and society.","To maintain a joyful family requires much from both the parents and the children. Each member of the family has to become, in a special way, the servant of the others.","Violence and arms can never resolve the problems of men.","The question confronting the Church today is not any longer whether the man in the street can grasp a religious message, but how to employ the communications media so as to let him have the full impact of the Gospel message.","You are priests, not social or political leaders. Let us not be under the illusion that we are serving the Gospel through an exaggerated interest in the wide field of temporal problems.","Pervading nationalism imposes its dominion on man today in many different forms and with an aggressiveness that spares no one. The challenge that is already with us is the temptation to accept as true freedom what in reality is only a new form of slavery.","The great danger for family life, in the midst of any society whose idols are pleasure, comfort and independence, lies in the fact that people close their hearts and become selfish.","The vow of celibacy is a matter of keeping one's word to Christ and the Church. a duty and a proof of the priest's inner maturity; it is the expression of his personal dignity.","Humanity should question itself, once more, about the absurd and always unfair phenomenon of war, on whose stage of death and pain only remain standing the negotiating table that could and should have prevented it.","Radical changes in world politics leave America with a heightened responsibility to be, for the world, an example of a genuinely free, democratic, just and humane society.","Wars generally do not resolve the problems for which they are fought and therefore... prove ultimately futile.","Today, for the first time in history, a Bishop of Rome sets foot on English soil. This fair land, once a distant outpost of the pagan world, has become, through the preaching of the Gospel, a beloved and gifted portion of Christ's vineyard.","Do not abandon yourselves to despair. We are the Easter people and hallelujah is our song.","Love is never defeated, and I could add, the history of Ireland proves it.","I kiss the soil as if I placed a kiss on the hands of a mother, for the homeland is our earthly mother. I consider it my duty to be with my compatriots in this sublime and difficult moment.","Young people are threatened... by the evil use of advertising techniques that stimulate the natural inclination to avoid hard work by promising the immediate satisfaction of every desire.","Science can purify religion from error and superstition. Religion can purify science from idolatry and false absolutes.","I have a sweet tooth for song and music. This is my Polish sin.","The historical experience of socialist countries has sadly demonstrated that collectivism does not do away with alienation but rather increases it, adding to it a lack of basic necessities and economic inefficiency.","From now on it is only through a conscious choice and through a deliberate policy that humanity can survive.","The cemetery of the victims of human cruelty in our century is extended to include yet another vast cemetery, that of the unborn.","The United Nations organization has proclaimed 1979 as the Year of the Child. Are the children to receive the arms race from us as a necessary inheritance?","There are people and nations, Mother, that I would like to say to you by name. I entrust them to you in silence, I entrust them to you in the way that you know best.","The unworthy successor of Peter who desires to benefit from the immeasurable wealth of Christ feels the great need of your assistance, your prayers, your sacrifice, and he most humbly asks this of you.","War is a defeat for humanity.","I hope to have communion with the people, that is the most important thing.","You are our dearly beloved brothers, and in a certain way, it could be said that you are our elder brothers."],"Pope John XXIII":["Consult not your fears but your hopes and your dreams. Think not about your frustrations, but about your unfulfilled potential. Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do.","Men are like wine - some turn to vinegar, but the best improve with age.","Christ's flock is made up of sheep that not only listen to their shepherd, but are also able to recognize his voice, to follow him, faithfully and with full awareness, on the pastures of eternal life.","It is easier for a father to have children than for children to have a real father.","Christ's Church is, above all, the spiritual temple where every Christian knows he has his place: he knows he has it, and he is aware of his duty to keep it with honor, dignity, and grace.","I have looked into your eyes with my eyes. I have put my heart near your heart.","The feelings of my smallness and my nothingness always kept me good company.","The family is the first essential cell of human society.","Every Christian must be convinced of his fundamental and vital duty of bearing witness to the truth in which he believes and the grace that has transformed him.","Anybody can be Pope; the proof of this is that I have become one.","Italians come to ruin most generally in three ways, women, gambling, and farming. My family chose the slowest one.","It often happens that I wake up at night and begin to think about a serious problem and decide I must tell the Pope about it. Then I wake up completely and remember that I am the Pope.","In this world of ours, every believer must be a spark of light, a center of love, a vivifying ferment for the mass; and it will be that all the more as, in the depths of his being, he lives in communion with God.","It is now for the Catholic Church to bend herself to her work with calmness and generosity. It is for you to observe her with renewed and friendly attention.","Authority is mainly a moral power; therefore, it must first call upon the conscience, that is, upon the duty that each person has to contribute willingly to the common good.","See everything, overlook a great deal, correct a little.","Born poor, but of honored and humble people, I am particularly proud to die poor.","Every man has the right to life, to bodily integrity.","Here I am at the end of the road and at the top of the heap.","A peaceful man does more good than a learned one.","I am able to follow my own death step by step. Now I move softly towards the end.","I must consider myself as the man of the cross and love the one that God gives me without thinking any further.","Christian life means sacrifice.","The true and solid peace of nations consists not in equality of arms, but in mutual trust alone.","The council now beginning rises in the Church like the daybreak, a forerunner of most splendid light."],"Pope Paul VI":["Nothing makes one feel so strong as a call for help.","All life demands struggle. Those who have everything given to them become lazy, selfish, and insensitive to the real values of life. The very striving and hard work that we so constantly try to avoid is the major building block in the person we are today.","Somebody should tell us, right at the start of our lives, that we are dying. Then we might live life to the limit, every minute of every day. Do it! I say. Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows.","The world calls for, and expects from us, simplicity of life, the spirit of prayer, charity towards all, especially towards the lowly and the poor, obedience and humility, detachment, and self-sacrifice. Without this mark of holiness, our word will have difficulty in touching the heart of modern man.","If you want peace work for justice.","A dimple on the chin, the devil within.","Of all human activities, man's listening to God is the supreme act of his reasoning and will.","The work of art, just like any fragment of human life considered in its deepest meaning, seems to me devoid of value if it does not offer the hardness, the rigidity, the regularity, the luster on every interior and exterior facet, of the crystal.","Never reach out your hand unless you're willing to extend an arm.","The Eucharistic mystery stands at the heart and center of the liturgy since it is the fount of life by which we are cleansed and strengthened to live not for ourselves but for God and to be united in love among ourselves.","We believe with all the strength of our spirit that mankind has a supreme, primary and irreplaceable need which can be satisfied only through Jesus Christ, the first-born among men, the head of the new humanity, in whom each individual reaches full self-realization.","Technological society has succeeded in multiplying the opportunities for pleasure, but it has great difficulty in generating joy.","Think how many blameless lives are brightened by the blazing indiscretions of other people.","Liturgy is like a strong tree whose beauty is derived from the continuous renewal of its leaves, but whose strength comes from the old trunk, with solid roots in the ground.","Every mother is like Moses. She does not enter the promised land. She prepares a world she will not see.","In youth, the days are short and the years are long. In old age, the years are short and days long.","Anger is as a stone cast into a wasp's nest.","No more war! Never again war! If you wish to be brothers, drop your weapons.","Are there memories left that are safe from the clutches of phony anniversaries?","Physics does not change the nature of the world it studies, and no science of behavior can change the essential nature of man, even though both sciences yield technologies with a vast power to manipulate the subject matters.","I met a hundred men going to Delhi, and every one is my brother.","You must strive to multiply bread so that it suffices for the tables of mankind, and not rather favor an artificial control of birth, which would be irrational, in order to diminish the number of guests at the banquet of life.","We consider Christmas as the encounter, the great encounter, the historical encounter, the decisive encounter, between God and mankind. He who has faith knows this truly; let him rejoice.","Never give advice in a crowd.","The older the fiddler, the sweeter the tune."],"Pope Shenouda III":["Egypt is not a country we live in but a country that lives within us.","As temples of the Holy Spirit. we should have communion with the Holy Spirit. The work of any believer is not only the work of a human individual, but is actually the work of the Holy Spirit.","You don't extinguish fire by adding more fire, you need water.","The Coptic Church respects the law but it does not accept rulings that go against the Bible and our freedom of religion.","Violence is absolutely not our method.","Debating religious beliefs are a red line, a deep red line.","If everyone got a divorce and looked for a second wife, the Coptic family would lose its moral compass.","We're not opposed to Catholics having pride in their church, but that doesn't mean that every church that doesn't join them isn't a church.","The world sees in our conduct, in our behaviour, the proof that we are the real children of God.","Homosexuality is against nature. Sexual expression is permitted only within marriage, between man and woman, male and female. Anything else is an abnormality and is against nature.","Civil disobedience is not accepted by religion and the state does not accept it and there are many verses in the Holy Book that talk of following the ruler.","Calm can solve all issues."],"Pope Theodoros II":["I like the monastic life... in the prayer and the praising... this has charged me with new energy, spiritual energy. This is very important for my ministry outside the monastery.","Love never ends or fails. Love never ends. Everything must be based on love - the relation between two friends, my ministry, my service; the church services in every field must be based on love. Why? Because God is Love.","The constitution is for us all to live together, a common life, we need each other.","Even if humans feel lots of fear, remember God will take care of you. This is a collective message because fear is contagious... This is a message of reassurance.","I put myself in the hands of Christ, who is the true leader of the church.","We pray for this beloved country, Egypt, for God to protect her safety, security, stability; to protect her unity and more so, her image.","We don't pray for the land. We pray for the humans, all humans... starting with the president, Mohammed Morsi, and all officials, and for God to give everyone wisdom and responsibility to manage the affairs of this country and its people in true Egyptian spirit.","Integrating in the society is a fundamental scriptural Christian trait. This integration is a must - moderate constructive integration. All of us, as Egyptians, have to participate.","I hope the day that all the Christians are one. This is my dream."],"Poppy Delevingne":["She's my baby sister - I could talk about her till I'm blue in the face.","All I ever wanted was to be a sexy bride, and actually, I think I've turned into a romantic bride.","I'm such a bikini girl. Generally, I like to be as half-naked as I possibly can.","I'm quite into fitness, and I have a fantastic personal trainer who knows me, knows my body, knows when to push me, and knows when not to push me. She doesn't make me do 20 burpees in a row and instead focuses on strengthening my core, telling me we need to focus on making me into 'a tall giraffe'!","Attack your lashes with the wand. I think there's nothing wrong with doing that.","Accessories are key - nothing beats a cool Panama hat or statement shades - look to Maison Michel or Miu Miu for inspiration.","My home has a split personality. Some of the rooms are very French antique. Think Aubusson rugs, turquoise ceramic jugs, sandbag pillows, and broken birdcages. The other half is very Aztec. Neon ikat fabric pillows, vintage books piled up to the ceiling, and shutters from Bali.","I love maxi dresses, I feel so great when I put on a maxi dress, big earrings and sandals.","One trend I always go for is nautical: stripes, navy, rope knot belts, gold buckles.","I'm pretty adventurous - the more wacky, the better! Sometimes I'll want to look chic, but lots of the time, I'll wear really mad colours and patterns, as it's just more fun.","I'm a real bath addict. I could sit in a bath and soak for days on end, and you'll never see me again. It's my easiest, nicest thing. So if you're giving me something extra to do, an extra step to make bathtime last longer, then I'll do it.","I'm all about people that appreciate, that are grateful, that smile, that have a sense of humour - the dirtier the laugh, the better- that's my kind of vibe... and I hope that's the kind of thing that I attract.","I always find it difficult to dress in between seasons, but I quite like putting T-shirts on with a vest over the top and another layer so you can peel them back as the day goes on.","My first fragrance as a kid was Tommy Girl. It was amazing. Wasn't it the thing to wear? And then I remember I stopped wearing it because it was literally like the whole classroom was filled with Tommy Girl.","I like my social media space to be somewhere very positive... I like to just be able to just share any images they see, or a piece of art or an item of clothing, and get to share that with the world.","I'm not used to going out every single night, which you can do in New York.","Having a Mary Poppins-themed birthday party when I was 5 - all my friends went in dresses, and I went as a chimney sweep. I was a real tomboy.","I'm bonkers about juicing. I got into it when I lived in L.A. - I'd juice three times a day.","I never dress up too much on holiday, but I do spend money on good sandals from labels like Aquazzura.","Scorpio Island, everyone calls it - they say if you fall in love in Ibiza, then it lasts forever.","The best holiday I went on as a kid was to Disney World. I wore the same Minnie Mouse dress for 5 days straight and refused to go on any rides apart from It's A Small World. I think my parents wanted to kill me.","It would be ridiculous for me to say I am unlucky, but, like any other family and any other girl, I've had my ups and downs.","Both my grandmother and mother used to wear the Red Roses cologne, and when I was 21 or 22, I smelled the same scent on a friend of mine.","I have a lot of energy. Energy's a very huge thing in our family. None of us need caffeine; we're just high-energy people.","I love the characters you can build upon when you wear different things. You know, sometimes, I'll want to be girly and wear tulle on a Tuesday, and sometimes I wanna be like Kim Kardashian and wear black leather head-to-toe.","I love all girl squads. I'm all for, like, girl power and friendship, and I'm all about that.","Sometimes, fame does scare me. When people know where you are and what you're doing, that can be frightening because I'm such a private person. So I like to try and keep things light-hearted and stay as private as possible.","Once, I tried to channel my inner Pocahontas and wore a lot of Navajo prints, a lot of beige, fringe, and suede... I wish I hadn't done that.","You could say I'm a bit of a nomad.","I love to shut out the world sometimes and hibernate.","I'm more of a handbag girl; my guilty pleasure is bags. I don't even have a clue how many I own.","I'm always late for things and always feel like I'm rushing.","I'm normally fairly busy rushing from job to job, so have little time in the mornings for my beauty regime. However, this usually means my hair and makeup is done for me when I get there, which is great!","A great Dermalogica facial every few weeks, and lots of sleep over the weekend are essentials. I also drink lots of water which really helps to hydrate the skin and keep it looking fresh.","I would say I spend about an hour a day cleansing and moisturising after all of the make-up I've worn on jobs, and on weekends I tend to go bare-faced to give my skin a bit of a break.","My mother is the bravest human being I've ever come across.","It was only when I began modeling at 18 that I really began enjoying fashion and reading any fashion magazine I could get my hands on, and developing a profound respect for designers, fashion and how to wear it.","I never do anything that doesn't feel natural to me. I wake up in the morning and I know what to put on - it's my sixth sense, really.","Cara was six years younger. She slept in my bed for years.","The wonderful thing about my husband is that we are very good at being independent.","Luck is believing you're lucky.","I try out all the latest beauty products and participate in all the shows. It's pretty magical.","Choupette literally has the finest tuna, the finest of everything a cat could ever have.","When I was about 4, my mum had a lime-green Versace jacket with massive shoulder pads, and I remember thinking, 'Why does her head look so small? Why is she doing that to herself?' But she loved it!","Diversity definitely makes the best wardrobe - you want to look in and see a range so you can always dress for your mood.","I really like the Nineties! I want to bring back more of the Nineties, like the 'Spice Girls', 'Empire Records', Chloe Sevigny. I don't think anyone really gave it enough credit.","Jo Sykes made these incredible leather jackets: the leather was like butter. I had one, but I lost it at a wedding in Ibiza. It was so sad; I've not been able to replace.","I'd rather rule the world now than be prime minister.","When I was at school, I auditioned for the school play as Queen Gertrude, and I fell in love with it there and then.","'The Five People You Meet in Heaven' by Mitch Albom - I read it in eight hours and blubbed my eyes out when it finished. I've thought about the story every day since.","I love working with Chanel, and long may it reign, to be honest. I hope it lasts forever.","Wear things that make you happy because, I think, that really shines through. If you feel uncomfortable in something, then I don't think it ever really works.","I love high-street fashion. I'm all about Topshop and Zara - even American Apparel. I love T-shirts and vests - simple things you can just live in. American Apparel also does the best bras - they're amazing.","My style is a little more thought out, in a way, but I guess it's eclectic at the same time. I wouldn't be able to describe my style, because it changes on a day-to-day basis, depending on what sort of mood I'm in.","I feel - as I'm edging to my thirties, I feel like a stronger person and a more confident person.","Pubs would be number one. And black cabs and cabbies - moody cabbies always crack me up. And the other thing I love is the parks: the parks around London don't get enough airtime - I think they're sensational, and when spring hits, the first thing I'll do is go to the park.","The smell of cigars reminds me of someone I used to know, and it just always brings me back. I love it; I find something very comforting about it.","Having hibernation weekends where I just sleep for hours on end. Working out when you have those spare moments. All of that is very important.","If I'm in America... I will track down the nearest Soul Cycle, wherever that is, and I'll just power through on a bike for 45 minutes.","When I'm in the U.K., I have a personal trainer who is wonderful, and she's hard-core and makes sure I get up in the morning and go.","I absolutely love Sisley moisturising cream, which I use every morning; it also provides a great base for make-up, and I adore Laura Mercier tinted moisturiser for an overall finish.","I'm actually rubbish at selfies. I always feel a bit ridiculous doing it unless I'm with a bunch of friends, where I'll usually stand at the back with a huge grin on my face!","I love anything by Sisley for face and Lancaster for body.","I always have an item in mind that I want to wear; then, the next day, I put it on, and I love the 20-minute rush of frantically tearing clothes out of my wardrobe to go with it. And I honestly feel that's the best way to do it; there's no method to my fashion madness so to speak.","I don't have a set way of dressing or a uniform, though I kind of wish I did. But then again, I also love that I can be any sort of character I want - that's a little bit of the actress coming out of me.","When you grow up, you think everything you own is going to be designer. Not true. Most of the stuff I own is high-street. I love mixing it up; it's so beautifully made nowadays, and the quality is of such a high standard, and let's be honest: everybody loves a bargain.","We have all learned that addiction and mental illnesses are illnesses, and I think a lot of people overlook that it is a chemical imbalance; it's like cancer, a sickness, and people need to see it as that.","She is such a doer, Cara - she is so ambitious. She has always known what she wants, and she's a hustler. Sometimes I call her, and I'm like, 'You need to help me hustle,' and she is like, 'Come on!'","Cara, ever since you told me at the age of four that you wanted to be Claudia Schiffer, while you were naked in the bath with a sponge on your head, I knew you were destined for great things.","Coconut oil. I rub it through my hair, all over my skin, all over my body. Natural's the better way to go.","I think the first outfit that really kick-started my relationship with Chanel means a lot to me: it was a black, sort of Studio 54-inspired jumpsuit with gold stars all over it, and I wore that, and that's how my relationship with Chanel began, so, you know, it has sentimental value.","I eat meat, dairy, and tons of fruits and vegetables, but I could also have pasta for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Basically, I'm a massive foodie who eats everything in moderation.","When traveling, I like Urth Caffe in L.A. for eggs Benedict with prosciutto or Balthazar in New York, where I order duck shepherd's pie.","I'm lucky to have a fast metabolism, so I haven't had to exercise much.","I shampoo and condition with Kerastase products but rarely brush it because I'm all about the Kate Moss bed-head look.","A little bit of sun does wonders! With good protection, of course. Vitamin D is just so good for your hair and your nails. I also love coconut water and coconut oil from Whole Foods. It's amazing. You can cook with it, shower with it... you come out of the shower like a slippery seal, but it works.","I'm a bit of a bed head: I'm always running around with no make-up on and my hair in a mess, but my nails are one thing I do love to keep looking nice, so it's rare to see me without it.","I love make-up so much, but I'm a bit rubbish at skincare; I'm really disloyal and never stick to one thing."],"Poppy Harlow":["Even after working at 'MarketWatch' and loving journalism and loving business news, I still wanted to be a lawyer because it was my plan.","The writers on my team and the producers and executive producer should be called talent. We anchor four hours on Saturday and three on Sunday. How they do that astonishes me.","I've made my mistakes at CNN. As I learn and I grow, one thing that has always stuck with me is you can never be over-prepared, and nobody can fight the facts."],"Poppy Montgomery":["There is nothing that anyone can say to prepare you for childbirth. Each woman's experience is so different; you never know how it will be for you!","Maybe I'm secretly in my soul a method actor.","Every rule should be broken at least one time.","I always try to make things fun.","I work my butt off to stay in shape, especially after having had a baby.","Exercise makes me a better parent. I'm calmer and happier.","You can make all the birth plans in the world, but at the end of the day - go with the flow.","I should have been a stuntwoman.","I never know why shows succeed or don't succeed, which is why I look at it as, 'I'll do the best work that I can', and if the fans and people respond then I'm always really flattered and honored, and if they don't then I'll try and do something next time that they like better. But I have no idea what makes a hit show, I really don't.","I love men - everything about them: the way they look, the way they smell, the way they feel. I love their minds.","I was never tomboyish. I loved Barbies. It's just the way I grew up.","I'm the girliest girl you'll ever meet.","Women are supposed to want to settle down and have a family. That's not for me.","I got expelled from every school I went to in Sydney.","Hollywood's full of transients. Everybody comes from somewhere else.","When you spend seven years with a group of people and suddenly you're not together, it's very jarring.","I have spent too long training myself to speak with an American accent, it's ingrained. I spend 16 hours a day on set speaking with an American accent. Now, when I try to speak with an Aussie accent, I just sound like a caricature of myself.","I talk about being Australian a lot.","I was a redhead when I first came to America.","I'm outspoken and I'm headstrong.","When I get it into my head that I want to do something, I do it."],"Poppy Z. Brite":["And I can't think of a reason I'd ever use a pseudonym, as I wouldn't want to publish something that I didn't like enough to put my name on it.","Celebrities, even insignificant ones like me, are created to be abused by the Great Unwashed.","I certainly don't think I would have been asked to pose for Rage if I wasn't a known writer.","I certainly wanted to write a book that was honest about New Orleans without explaining it to death, so much so that the first draft contained references absolutely incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't lived here for several years.","I don't like to talk about work in progress, but the novel I'm working on now is definitely not horror.","I like visiting people's homes on Saint Joseph's Day, when people set up altars, serve food as a tribute to the saint, and invite the public - I enjoy that much more than Mardi Gras.","I think film had a terrible effect on horror fiction particularly in the 80s, with certain writers turning out stuff as slick and cliched as Hollywood movies.","I'd much rather do an obviously commercial writing project than get a day job.","I've certainly learned a great deal from my husband, though, and could never have written a book like Liquor without him and the people he introduces me to and the stories he brings home.","I've tried to avoid labels, but they always find you.","In France, for instance, one magazine writer was convinced that On The Road had been a huge influence on Lost Souls and was crushed to learn that I hadn't read the one until after I'd written the other.","In high school I was the dog, always, and I never have felt comfortable or right in my body, and part of my whole exhibitionist thing has probably been a way of testing to see whether or not I really was this repulsive creature that I felt like for so long.","In the Netherlands I read the first chapter of Exquisite Corpse to an audience that laughed in all the places I thought were funny - an experience I've never had in America!","Mostly I enjoy the restaurants (my husband is a chef), though I wish we had a wider diversity of ethnic food.","My childhood may have been more demented than most, because I learned to read very early and was allowed to read whatever I wanted.","My dad told me that no one could ever make it as a writer, that my chances were equivalent to winning the lottery - which was good for me, because I like to have something to prove.","My mother is an office manager, my father a professor of economics and financial planner.","New Orleans cuisine is Creole rather than Cajun.","Some of the food in Liquor is food I've really eaten filtered through a veil of fiction.","There are people who must spend huge amounts of time composing these online diatribes against me, all about how disgusting and terrible I am and how no one should ever read my books, and it's not enough for them to hate me, they can't stand the fact that ANYONE likes me!","This is the point being missed by readers who lament Liquor's lack of hot sex scenes, probably because they aren't old enough to understand that a passionate relationship could be about anything other than sex.","Yeah, I think A Confederacy of Dunces is probably the perfect New Orleans book."],"Portia Doubleday":["I guess rebelliousness has been explored in many movies, but what about the smart kids' rebellion? Not just the motorcycle jackets and that kind of rebellion; it's the dorky kid - what could he do?","Growing up I did commercials and things like that, but nothing serious. As I got older, my family is really hardcore into academics. They weren't wanting to necessarily support an acting career; it's a really fickle business, and it can be difficult and unstable. They were rooting for education and the whole nine yards.","I'm more androgynous, because men are supposed to be more spatial, women more literal - I'm a tomboy.","In my heart and soul, I always knew that I wanted to be in show business.","I come from an artistic family. My dad's an actor, my mother's an actress, my sister's an actress. So I kind of grew up in that kind of environment. Oddly enough, I never really knew about my parents' work. I've seen small clips of it, but we never actually spoke about the business.","I played soccer for 12 years on three different teams at a time.","I've always had a more spatial mind, mathematical, than literal.","If I could play football, I'd play football. But not women's football - real football. Or I'd just date a quarterback.","I don't understand what's happening in 'Mr. Robot' all the time, and I'm really actually intimated for the second season. I'll have to rewatch the first season, I think.","I was 18 years old when I booked 'Youth in Revolt,' and it was my first movie, and I was starring in that movie - and even then, I didn't feel like I had made it.","My sister basically showed me how to be a person for many years of my life. I just didn't really fit anywhere, and my sister was always really comfortable in who she was.","The honest truth is - and I have felt this way forever - is my largest competitor is myself. Always. I am intimidated by my own hang-ups about acting more so than anything, any part, any director."],"Portia Simpson-Miller":["Jamaica is more than just the 'brand' the world recognizes so well; it's a place of pride for the people who live here, its educational institutions, its sports achievements, its science and technology growth.","If you empower people in their communities and get them jobs, no one like Dudus Coke can win their hearts and minds and hold them hostage.","I'm a Christian woman, but I believe in human rights. I do not go into people's bedrooms. I appoint people based on their capabilities, not their sexual orientation.","No one should be discriminated against because of their sexual orientation.","I'm a Christian woman, but I believe in human rights.","I was actually born in deep rural Jamaica and came to Kingston as a high school girl."],"Portia de Rossi":["I ran into Ellen at a photo shoot. She took my breath away. That had never happened to me in my life.","I love to work. I really enjoy getting up really early and driving downtown. I just really love the process of acting and being on a series.","When you have the paparazzi hiding in the bushes outside your home, the only thing you can control is how you respond publicly.","I married him for a green card. We had a really great, caring relationship; it just obviously wasn't right for me.","We must be able to inspire. That's my goal in acting.","I'm living by example by continuing on with my career and having a full, rich life, and I am incidentally gay.","I didn't choose the fact that I was gay, but I did choose whether to live my life as a gay woman-that was the terrifying thing for me. Especially being a gay actress.","I had a hell of a time convincing people I was gay - which was so annoying!","You live with the fear people might find out. Then you actually have the courage to tell people and they go, I don't think you are gay. It's enough to drive you crazy.","My sexuality is a part of me that I really like. But it's not the totality of me.","It sounds so trite, but my private life is mine.","Supermodels are over, and the new picture girl has become the television actress.","If you've looked at all the glamour magazines lately, all the covers are actresses. If they are on those covers, they are going to try to emulate models. That's just the way it is.","Just look at all the awards shows now. It has turned into a catwalk. You have to be wearing a certain designer, a certain dress, and everyone's critiquing.","I want to exude strength and intelligence.","People might find me attractive, but it's also my job to prove that I can be intelligent.","I try to be feminine, yet intellectual and smart at the same time. You don't see enough of that.","I want young people to see me and think you can be feminine and smart and successful, all at the same time.","The most important thing for me was to never, ever, ever deny it. But I didn't really have the courage to talk about it. I was thinking, The people who need to know I'm gay know.","I justified it in so many ways. I had a very, very long and difficult struggle with my sexuality.","I thought, I'm out in my life, that doesn't involve my public life.","I was very sexual from a very young age.","I knew that I was gay, I knew it. I just couldn't see myself as a gay woman, even though that's where my heart was.","In high school I had sex with girls quite a few times. They were straight women who I convinced to jump in the sack with me.","I did a lot of fast talking as a youth; I was pretty good at it. I was never talked into it - I was always the one doing the talking.","When I was 15, I changed my name legally. I think it was largely due to my struggle about being gay. Everything just didn't fit, and I was trying to find things I could identify myself with, and it started with my name.","I stumbled into acting and just loved it. I deferred law school-and I'm still deferred.","I've had so many interviews where the last question is, Are you gay? I had to find very creative ways to say that I was gay, but that I wasn't going to talk about it.","I really never stopped thinking about Ellen, because I just haven't felt that kind of energy with anyone in my life.","I saw Ellen and my knees were weak. It was amazing. And it was very hard for me to get her out of my mind after that. Then when I saw her that night, we started talking, and that's that.","My feelings for Ellen overrode all of my fear about being out as a lesbian. I had to be with her, and I just figured I'd deal with the other stuff later.","I don't even like watching sex scenes in movies. I have a slight prudish side to me.","Everyone is their own kind of lesbian. To think there's a certain way to dress or present yourself in the world is just one more stereotype we have to fit into.","I love being able to wear dresses and clothes that make me feel feminine and beautiful, and I love the fact that I don't have to all the time; I can wear a tank and jeans.","I have to be asked, I guess, but I love the idea of marriage. I think it's beautiful. I'm such a romantic, and I always have been.","If I was 14 and knew some gay people, I wouldn't nearly have had the struggle I had. Our world is definitely changing.","When I watched Ellen come out in '97, my jaw was on the floor. I thought, There are some people who break the doors down, hold them open, and some people who walk right through.","When I was anorexic it just seemed like I literally wanted to disappear. And now I would like to reappear.","Eating disorders are shrouded in secrecy, and there are so many things I felt very ashamed of that I could never talk about. Even though I have fully recovered, there were still things that I needed to go through again and work through.","I have a very, very healthy relationship with food in that I eat whatever I want, whenever I want. I never restrict quantities or types of food.","I never, ever, restrict food, and I will never go on a diet ever again.","Even if I'm hormonal and I feel like I've got a couple pounds of water weight, I will never starve myself, I will never, ever go on a diet.","Oh, I don't have any fans. Personally? I don't have any.","The first time I was paparazzi'd, I thought I was being investigated for an insurance claim."],"Post Malone":["I'm just myself. That's the best way to put it.","You just got with the flow because life is just all about how you feel.","I started making music... I guess I was 12, and I started playing 'Guitar Hero.' And you know, it got to a point where on expert, you can only exceed to a certain point. And so, you know, I was like, 'Let's play real guitar. Let's not waste more time.' So, I got my mom, I told her to buy me a guitar for Christmas, and I started making music then.","I like to be quiet and play guitar and just chill.","In order to find yourself, who you really are, you got to be with yourself; you got to hang out with yourself.","There's always gonna be setbacks; there's always gonna be knockdowns. There's always gonna be people telling you, 'Hey, you suck!'","I'm hungry. I'm ready to grow.","If you like something, rock it. If you want to rock a cape every day, go for it.","I was a sad kid.","I don't know what people think of me.","Miami is always super, duper lit.","It has been wild, you know? I started out just putting a song that I made out on the Internet without being sure if anyone was going to like it, and it took me on tour around the world with Justin Bieber. It's been amazing!","I'm trying to bring a little bit of every type of sauce into one type of sound. Something that's really fresh.","In New York, my dad raised me to listen to everything like hip-hop, rock and country music. When I moved to Dallas, I started listening to whatever I wanted to listen to.","There are times pop music is the end result when I'm in the studio, but I don't really go in and say, 'Today I am going to make a pop song,' but it can happen.","I got FL studios; I looked up how to make beats and how to record myself, and then I just started making music from there.","Hip-hop and country aren't too far different: They got shiny suits and the boots and the guitars with their names on it. I was infatuated with that type of stuff.","I am just creating the music I enjoy to make, and people seem to enjoy it.","I'm not worried about making a certain type of music or sticking to one type of music.","All my dance moves are improv. I just make them up on the spot.","I might wear skinny pants one day; I might wear thrift shop pants the next day.","When I was up in New York, the first record my parents bought me was the Terror Squad record with 'Lean Back.'","I moved to Dallas, and I started making music.","I'm just trying to make music everybody can get happy to and vibe to and turn up to. So long as I keep making good music, everything's going to be OK.","I'm a pretty happy guy.","It's not normal for a white guy to get corn rows; a lot of people judged me. I like the way it looks, so you have to be confident.","I didn't have no friends or nothing; I was a nerdy kid.","Once you have an established song, you can really come out of your shell and experiment with the sound you want to make.","You can't get tired in the studio. It's really tough. But you just gotta keep on going.","I'm trying to make music that I like, and I love hip-hop. At the same time, I love guitar. I love rock and everything.","Stevie Nicks is dope.","Bieber's like my brother at this point.","I think a show is more of an interacting with fans than you just singing songs.","I'm just a fun guy.","I just want to keep making music and see where everything goes.","There were some times when I just wanted to quit making music.","My dad was always playing music. Not, like, playing music but listening to music."],"Potter Stewart":["Ethics is knowing the difference between what you have a right to do and what is right to do.","Censorship reflects a society's lack of confidence in itself.","Fairness is what justice really is.","In fact, a fundamental interdependence exists between the personal right to liberty and the personal right to property.","Abortion is inherently different from other medical procedures because no other procedure involves the purposeful termination of a potential life.","I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material but I know it when I see it.","The dichotomy between personal liberties and property rights is a false one. Property does not have rights. People have rights.","The 4th Amendment and the personal rights it secures have a long history. At the very core stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.","Swift justice demands more than just swiftness.","It must always be remembered that what the Constitution forbids is not all searches and seizures, but unreasonable searches and seizures.","To force a lawyer on a defendant can only lead him to believe that the law contrives against him.","A person's mere propinquity to others independently suspected of criminal activity does not give rise to probable cause to search that person."],"Poul Anderson":["We live with our archetypes, but can we live in them?","I wrote the first book, Harvest of Stars, and as I was writing it, I saw that certain implications had barely been touched on... It's perfectly obvious that two completely revolutionary things are going on, with cybernetics, and biological science.","I have yet to see any problem, however complicated, which, when looked at in the right way did not become still more complicated.","In Harvest of Stars, there is this notion, not original with me of course, that it will become possible to download at least the basic aspects of a human personality into a machine program.","What five books would I like to be remembered for? Well... Tau Zero, I like that one especially. It was somewhat of a tour de force, and I think it got across what I was trying for."],"Powell Clayton":["These are the days for strong men to courageously expose wrong.","In my preaching the shafts are ever aimed at the brainwashed horde.","Freedom is an internal achievement rather than an external adjustment.","Mix a conviction with a man and something happens.","Let's trace the birth of an idea. It's born as rampant radicalism, then it becomes progressivism, then liberalism, then it becomes moderated conservative, outmoded, and gone."],"Powers Boothe":["I wanted to be in 'The Emerald Forest.' I chased that one for six months before it all came about. I wanted to work with John Boorman!","I've been fortunate in my career to have the opportunity to pick and choose the parts I play. I've also been lucky to always be involved with quality actors, quality directors, quality writers.","I think I'm pretty politically informed, and I find myself watching Senate hearings on C-SPAN.","When I first came to Hollywood, I played about as many guys who save the day and get the girl as I played heavies. It's just that heavies are more interesting and last in people's minds.","Before I accept a job, I always talk to folks about it. 'Why does he kill these 22 people?' If they say, 'What difference does it make?' I know we have nothing more to talk about. A character has to be three-dimensional.","The first 10 years I was a professional actor, I did Shakespeare.","I got a lot of flak; in Texas, football is not only the social thing you must do, but you do it also to prove your manhood. They all couldn't conceive of why I'd want to stop to do 'The Importance of Being Earnest.'","I was the first one in the family, on either side, to go to college - much less graduate school.","If you're down, it's curse; if you're up, it's a blessing.","When I'm out there, it's just me. Nobody's controlling me, and I can do whatever I want to do. I'm my own man.","Sometimes, I feel like directors look at me and say, 'I want to put that boy in the jungle. I want to hurt him.'","If I rob a gas station, I'm going to get 15 years. If I steal $400 million on Wall Street, I start plea-bargaining.","I was raised a proper Southern boy.","I've always wanted to play a hard-boiled gumshoe, as they say.","I've had presidents in my lifetime - and I'm old enough to have seen several - that I really detested, but they're still my president. I've had presidents that I've really liked.","The office of the presidency is what's important, no matter who's in it.","We all want to pretend that there isn't evil in the world. We all want to pretend that there aren't people trying to take us out and different things like that.","I've got a family, and I love them, and I want them to have the best opportunities in the best country in the world, and I think we have to fight for it.","Everyone has this vision of Jones as a maniacal ogre. Wrong. He was charming, sweet, and a fabulous speaker.","I'm not going to make my living out of beating my head against somebody else.","You don't do classics with a Texas accent.","I've auditioned five or six times. I'm not very good at it.","I come prepared when I come to work. Not just knowing the lines, but I think I know something about what I do.","One thing that's thematically consistent in 'Sin City' is that all the performances seem to be of the same genre, like we're singing the same song.","When 'Deadwood' came along, it was totally like Shakespeare. The long speeches were like soliloquies. If one phrase of a monologue was out of whack, the entire one-page speech didn't work.","That joy of a creative environment, without any restrictions, is hard to leave.","I was raised a Democrat, and now I'm an Independent.","I have always been attracted to good scripts and try hard to make characters as believable as possible. That means trying to figure out how they would react to situations, what they eat, think, and feel.","We're in the business of making films, not striking or anything else.","I like to think of myself as fairly intellectual.","If there is anything I am about, it is I want justice in society.","There are more heroes than cops, FBI agents, and lawyers.","We have real cliched ideas of what prison life is like. It is not a happy place. It's a desperate, sad situation.","There's something about playing the baddies that people like. They're more fun, and people tend to remember them, particularly if you do them well.","It's never a matter of career decisions. I don't think in those terms. What matters is whether a role is interesting, if I will enjoy playing it, and if I'm confident I can do a good job.","Since I've had some success, story and character are always the two elements I think about first in material presented to me. Some of my choices have been more successful than others.","Actors have far fewer choices than the public thinks they do.","Some stars can make five or six failures in a row and continue to work - with a raise. I can't figure how that works. Maybe foreign sales or a smart agent.","I like to do things that are about relationships, work with quality people, and tell a different kind of story.","I've always felt if you followed a real private detective around, it would be boring.","Any of us can sort of say we would do any number of things to feed our children.","I'm really enjoying the character now, but I don't want to just be Philip Marlowe. I wouldn't mind playing him every couple of years, perhaps, as a kind of open franchise - you know?"],"Prabal Gurung":["There is undoubtedly a lot of pressure that comes with recognition, which can be a good thing and bad thing all at the same time. But if you stay focused and don't lose sight of what you're doing and who you are, you can rise above it.","It saddens me to see the reality-television shows that are getting so much fanfare that are a celebration of stupidity and the degradation of women. And those women are consistently wearing too short, too tight dresses. I hope the trend of aging gracefully returns.","I'm fascinated by furniture design and interiors, and I want to try designing all that stuff.","There's such a feeling of satisfaction when something you imagined turned into something real.","I am not the kind of designer who is racing to the finish line, so while collaborations are important for our growth, each and every one has to be strategic and well-timed with what we have going on internally.","I make 98% of my collection in New York City and am generating jobs, so fashion isn't just frivolous for me. I understand levity about it. I also understand the depth of it.","I'm constantly thinking about design, shapes, patterns and colors, so I just want to be more of a blank canvas. But there is a comfort in knowing what you're going to wear, and that probably comes from Catholic school, where I wore a uniform for 10 years.","I have a 6-year-old niece who doesn't look like the majority of girls on the covers of magazines. I hope that by the time she's 16, the world will have changed.","I think I'm just really in love with women, and I love to see them looking incredibly, truly beautiful. I think every time a woman wears one of my dresses, you know, in a matter of speaking, I'm having a little love affair with her!","I mean, I can cook, but I'd get very nervous having my food being judged by dinner guests.","My goal is: I'm not trying to be snobby, but my clothes are not for everyone, not for every Hollywood celebrity. There is a designer for everyone, and a celebrity for every designer.","Girls who wear certain kind of dresses, who show certain areas of the body, are not going to like my clothes. You can't please everyone.","I was in Nepal and I had watched Oprah Winfrey's show. I had no idea, as a kid in Nepal, who she was, but I remember watching an episode of hers about living your dreams.","I would tell any aspiring designer to take the time to experience everything they can to really get a feel for what direction they want to go in. And most importantly, let your passion and your gut lead you.","I came from Bill Blass, where it was a well-oiled machine and if I said I needed a fabric, it was done. Now, I have to budget everything. I have to take on the role not just as a designer but a business. But I'm a glass half-full kind of guy.","I tweet myself and do all the Facebook updates. It started off with me wondering whether I was showing off and I was very careful about what I wrote.","I love draping; it's less about proportion than fit and the fabric. It's very specialized and I think when women see the construction, they respond to it immediately.","I'm not a believer of luck. I think opportunity and hard work becomes luck.","I decided if it was going to be a mistake to come to New York and try and make a career in fashion, then it was going to be my mistake... But the American dream is real. I'm living it.","There is one universal truth: All women, all over the world, want to look beautiful. That is always the theme of my designs."],"Pramoedya Ananta Toer":["I don't write to give joy to readers but to give them a conscience.","I'll do as I please. My mind is not to be imprisoned.","I happen to be pretty productive when I am in jail. When you are in jail, you have to spend more time with yourself.","Even though no one admits it, writers are leaders in their communities.","Every award for me is important because it means a slap against militarism and fascism in Indonesia.","Every book that is banned is a badge of honor.","I don't follow any kind of 'isms.' If there is one, it will be Pram-ism.","Let us see whether it is the New Order or me who will be the loser before Indonesian history. I have won. The New Order has fallen and my writings have been translated into 40 languages."],"Pranab Mukherjee":["India is a land of plenty inhibited by poverty; India has an enthralling, uplifting civilization that sparkles not only in our magnificent art, but also in the enormous creativity and humanity of our daily life in city and village.","I am comfortable at the height where destiny has put me.","There is no humiliation more abusive than hunger.","We are all equal children before our mother; and India asks each one of us, in whatsoever role we play in the complex drama of nation-building, to do our duty with integrity, commitment and unflinching loyalty to the values enshrined in our Constitution.","The government of India and the government of Jammu and Kashmir are determined to ensure that every Kashmiri lives with dignity having equal rights and equal opportunities.","No problems are ever resolved by violence. It only aggravates the pain and the hurt on every side.","The fact remains that secularism is inherent in the Indian system, in the Indian ethos and culture. India cannot but be secular.","If the rise of European colonisation began in 18th century India, then the rallying cry of 'Jai Hind!' also signalled its end in 1947.","In our generation, the role models were Gandhi and Nehru. We revered them. They were venerated personalities. I read almost every speech of Nehru.","Propelled by freedom of faith, gender equality and economic justice for all, India will become a modern nation. Minor blemishes cannot cloak the fact that India is becoming such a modern nation: no faith is in danger in our country, and the continuing commitment to gender equality is one of the great narratives of our times.","The young people of India will build a strong and powerful nation, a nation that is politically mature and economically strong, a nation whose people enjoy both a high quality of life as well as justice.","Let Jammu and Kashmir lead the way in the building of a new future for India. Let it set an example to the rest of India and the world by showing how the entire region can be transformed into a zone of peace, stability and prosperity.","I feel that when the reforms in UN take place and the Security Council will be expanded in the permanent membership category, India will have a place, I hope so, but first it is to be expanded.","In the 1980s, we were advised, why don't you follow Reaganomics or Thatcherite economics. We said, yes, there are good points, let's see how we can fit them in the Indian economy. Every country has its own way of moving forward.","I have seen vast, perhaps unbelievable, changes during the journey that has brought me from the flicker of a lamp in a small Bengal village to the chandeliers of Delhi.","Our federal Constitution embodies the idea of modern India: it defines not only India but also modernity.","Trickle-down theories do not address the legitimate aspirations of the poor. We must lift those at the bottom so that poverty is erased from the dictionary of modern India.","India is content with itself, and driven by the will to sit on the high table of prosperity. It will not be deflected in its mission by noxious practitioners of terror.","As Indians, we must of course learn from the past; but we must remain focused on the future. In my view, education is the true alchemy that can bring India its next golden age.","Teaching was my transition from student life to working life. In those days, our system of education was a little different. The number of students in each class was huge. I think in political science general, which I taught, it was around 100.","I come from a political family. My father was a freedom fighter. He was a prominent leader of the locality and member of the Congress party. He spent 10 years in British prisons. In the evening, in our living room, the only subject we used to discuss was politics. So politics was not unfamiliar to me.","We must recognise that in a globalised world, we cannot remain insulated from external developments. India's trade performance in the current year has been robust, surpassing pre-crisis export levels and pre-crisis export growth trends. We have diversified our export baskets and our export destinations.","I personally believe that the office of the President of India is not to be sought. It is to be offered.","Of course, running a coalition government in a country like India is a difficult task. More so when Congress leads the coalition, since most of the political parties were anti-Congress. To have a coalition, to run a coalition government, you require a lot of adjustments, a lot of flexibility.","Indian president does not determine policy. Here President is not the policy maker. In the name of the president, the cabinet takes the policy decision."],"Pranav Mistry":["For true augmented reality, the display would have to dynamically focus, which would require additional hardware on the glasses to read your eye.","Unlike other children, I did not get a branded video game. Mine was an open circuit that even buzzed.","I want to impact the world through futuristic yet affordable technologies to make the world a better place.","Digital world is changing its home, and I am in search of an evolution that exists beyond the digital world.","Computing is no more about work - it's all about making work happen with computers.","One of my ongoing projects is to expand third-eye technology whereby two people can watch two different things on a screen or type in two different languages on the same surface - all they have to do is wear a pair of hi-tech glass spectacles.","In computing, everything happens inside this rectangular screen. I want to get the pixels out, paint the world, and allow us to interact with it.","The digital world has power because it has dynamic information, but it's important that we stay human instead of being another machine sitting in front of a machine.","I have a background in technology, design, architecture, arts and sciences. I see myself as a multi-dimensional person.","Technology is only meaningful when it reaches the people.","There are endless consumer applications, but what excites me is how this can help people. A man who cannot speak communicates with sign language, but the average person doesn't know that language. SixthSense, if equipped with speakers, can recognize the gestures and form the words - it will speak for him.","When you talk about objects, one other thing automatically comes attached to that thing, and that is gestures: how we manipulate these objects, how we use these objects in everyday life. We use gestures not only to interact with these objects, but we also use them to interact with each other.","We are looking for an era where computing will actually merge with the physical world.","I think that integrating information to everyday objects will not only help us to get rid of the digital divide, the gap between these two worlds, but will also help us, in some way, to stay human, to be more connected to our physical world.","I have always been interested in exploring how we can leverage our knowledge about everyday objects, and how we use them, in order to interact with our digital world.","I want to work on impactful projects.","I'm not a very big fan of science fiction. I think that I'm a very big fan of living in the physical world.","I'm good with digital technology, but I start to miss the physical world. I miss riding my bike, talking to friends.","Whatever science fiction movies we watch now, we can make the technology real in two days. What we can do is not important. What we should do is more important.","As seventh graders, my classmates and I would make rockets to see what made them fly and models of remote-controlled motor boats because Palanpur had heavy rainfall.","My lab is like a fantasy world - it is more like a 'James Bond' movie!","We've evolved over millions of years to sense the world around us. We use our five natural senses to perceive information. But the huge amount of information mankind has accumulated and stored online cannot be perceived by these senses.","There is no link between our digital devices and our interactions with the physical world.","For me, how an appliance looks is as important as how efficiently it works.","Did you know that da Vinci was a painter, polymath, engineer, architect, biologist, and writer all rolled into one? He drew sketches of helicopters at a time when they weren't even invented!","Att our MIT lab, there are people from diverse backgrounds like architecture, psychology, and philosophy, giving a holistic touch to the creation of any technology we may have in mind.","I am keen to serve one-sixth of the world's population where the miracles of science and technology would multiply manifold for betterment of mankind.","I have poor people skills, and I cannot become a minister.","Had I wanted, I could have set up my own company, secured funding, and made money. That proposition, however, does not excite me, since it would be a very self-centric goal.","We need to stop talking and start acting, and I am more than eager to be part of that change.","With Gear, you're able to make calls and receive calls without ever taking your phone out of your pocket.","Exposure to fields like design to technology and from art to psychology gave me a quite nice/interesting viewpoint to the world.","I love to see technology from a design perspective and vice versa. I am a 'Desigineer.'","Many of my projects are inspired by Indian mythology. We have read that in the ancient times, people could expand their body parts, extend arms - all of that reads like a dream. But all this can be done using technology based on simple solutions.","As far as solving India's problems with technology is concerned, I think there are some wrong assumptions in making computing work at the grassroots. We need to go beyond the notion of technology being all about computers.","I would do anything that helps people do things better. Even if the Indian government comes to me for anything, I would be very open.","Our research centres are everywhere, in India, China, Turkey, Japan, and we all work as a team all the time.","What we strive for is how we can provide the best performance and best design, whatever the customers want.","I get bored after I invent something because I hate talking about it every time.","My life's goal is to get rid of computers and invent everything that removes its necessity.","It's about time we stopped asking what the computer can do for us and instead ask ourselves what we can do for the computer.","I am not interesting in making money. I go to the most expensive restaurant in Boston to have dinner. It is where billionaires come to eat. Even if I become richer, I will still have to go there to eat. After some time, money doesn't make a difference.","There is a revolution taking place in school and college campuses in India, and particularly in Kerala, much like the one that sowed the seeds of Silicon Valley in the U.S.","I'm sure that the ideas being incubated at places like Startup Village today will form the core of the technologies of tomorrow.","We wanted to make a wearable of tomorrow that is designed for everyone. I can proudly say Galaxy Gear is tomorrow's state of the art.","I can proudly say Galaxy Gear is a design statement, an engineering marvel, and something that really redefines tomorrow.","The real world is not in one direction.","Our time is a time for crossing boundaries.","We have created something incredible. You don't need to get your phone out anymore. Gear takes the entirety of your digital world and places it right where you can see."],"Pras Michel":["Seven out of 10 Americans are one paycheck away from being homeless.","There's a harsh reality - nothing lasts forever. You have to be ready to grow, and grow fast.","When I was leaving I kind of felt a little bit sad, because I made some friends down in skid row.","People in the record business would say, Well, Pras, you know, you haven't been out in a while, maybe you should get today's hottest producer or rapper to do something.","I'm one of those firm believers that good music will prevail.","I really can't blame anyone but myself, because I didn't have to deliver the album. But when you get caught up in the gas, and you're young, and there's so much helium going on around you, you can't decipher the real end.","For this album I was determined to do it my way. Take my time. I'm gonna win, lose or draw on my own.","I didn't want to do the whole, get the hottest person thing. I wanted to make sure every record felt right.","The record Clef and I did was just sitting there. So I said, Clef, I got a record, hit a verse on it. He just went in, messed around and ended up doing the hook too.","A couple of people thought I looked familiar, but it was like, No.","In life we try to grow and better ourselves. As an artist, I feel like I've grown tremendously.","When we came up with titles like Ready or Not, that's how we really felt.","I'm confident being at Universal, which is a great home for me, 'cause they understand what I'm trying to do."],"Pratibha Patil":["Corruption is the enemy of development, and of good governance. It must be got rid of. Both the government and the people at large must come together to achieve this national objective.","Our foremost priority is the removal of poverty, hunger and malnutrition, disease and illiteracy. All social welfare programmes must be implemented efficiently. Agencies involved in the delivery of services should have a strong sense of duty and work in a transparent, corruption-free, time-bound and accountable manner.","Parliament of the country is the repository of the sovereign will of the people, and its successful functioning is a joint responsibility of both the government and the Opposition.","There is simply no way our nation can progress if its women population is left behind.","There should be no effort, consciously or otherwise, that will lead to the erosion of institutional credibility and authority.","Women have talent and intelligence but, due to social constraints and prejudices, it is still a long distance away from the goal of gender equality.","I believe economic growth should translate into the happiness and progress of all. Along with it, there should be development of art and culture, literature and education, science and technology. We have to see how to harness the many resources of India for achieving common good and for inclusive growth.","India is known for its sobriety and wisdom, balanced and sensible thinking. We need strong institutions and we need good governance in the country.","This post of President is a Constitutional post. It is the duty of everyone, all citizens to see that they respect the post... the institution of President.","My government will make efforts to realize the farming potential of rain-fed and dry land areas by ensuring healthy participation by all stakeholders and convergence of various government sponsored programs.","Our goal of poverty eradication and of inclusive growth that embraces the disadvantaged and marginalized sections of society can be achieved when our actions are guided by a social conscience and are not devoid of sensitivity.","India seeks to be a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council... things like this don't happen automatically, you need constant dialogue and discussion with the world.","Five years ago, when I was elected, I had the feeling that the president doesn't have much to do. I've realized, though, that this is not a rubber-stamp position.","India-Seychelles relations have been characterized by close friendship, understanding and cooperation.","We view South Africa as one of our closest strategic partners in the developing world and in the African continent.","While bringing about reforms and improving institutions, we have to be cautious that while shaking the tree to remove the bad fruit, we do not bring down the tree itself.","All issues, therefore, must be resolved through dialogue and there can be no place for violence. Negativity and rejection cannot be the path for a vibrant country that is moving to seek its destiny.","Often, we are quick to find blame with others but yet are unable to give constructive responses. There seems to be a tendency to doubt almost everything. Do we not have faith in our own people's strengths and in our institutions? Can we afford distrust amongst ourselves?","It is important that the decorum and dignity of the House is upheld at all times. The image of Parliament in the public mind should be one where proceedings, debates and discussions take place with a view to resolve issues through a constructive and co-operative approach.","Financial institutions, the corporate world and civil society - all must uphold high standards of probity in their working. Only a genuine partnership between the Government and its people can bring about positive change to create a just society.","A paradigm shift, where, in addition to physical inputs for farming, a focused emphasis placed on knowledge inputs can be a promising way forward. This knowledge-based approach will bring immense returns, particularly in rain fed and dry land farming areas."],"Pratyusha Banerjee":["I connect with very few close friends in real life.","Getting married is a childhood dream for me.","I liked models since I was 3 years old. As I grew older, I started developing a penchant towards makeup, pedicures, etc. I used to carry out the procedures at my home itself.","I quit 'Jhalak' for 'Balika Vadhu.' I suffered from dengue; I was in ICU for three days, and then I quit 'Balika Vadhu.' I needed a change and wanted to experience new things.","I'd rather not think about the unpleasant side of the experience. 'Bigg Boss' is the biggest reality-show in India and perhaps in the world. I went into it on a clean slate.","My family supports me, since they trust me not to do anything wrong.","People are bound to comment, and that means they are following me.","Everybody thinks you're wrong and that you're a kid, and hence, you should shut up. Such reactions hurt me. I can think for myself.","Just because people are older, they don't have the right to tell you what's right and wrong.","I wanted to show the world the real Pratyusha.","I love TV and am happy doing TV shows.","I think reality shows have changed me for the better. They bring out the best in you when you are under tremendous pressure. That apart, I have made some very good friends from these shows.","I want to work in films but without compromising on my dignity.","I will get married to a guy of my parents' choice.","Whether I work or not depends on the family I get married to.","No man is worth sulking over.","The corruption doesn't cease, the crime rates don't come down, no matter which party comes to power.","I became very patient. There are a lot of times when people who do not like you are talking about you and telling bad things on your face. In our personal life, we do get affected by such things.","I have done good roles. I feel good about myself.","Whatever work I have done in a very short span of time, like 'Balika Vadhu,' 'Kitchen Champion 4,' 'Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa,' and 'Bigg Boss 7,' has been great for me.","The TV industry is a corporate world. People come, people go. They leave for growth, money, and many other reasons.","I like 'Pyaar Ka Dard Hai' on Star Plus. It not only has a good story but good actors as well.","There are too many shows about Rajasthani families.","I ended my journey with 'Balika'... on a good note, but I've been hearing that I threw tantrums on the set and had an attitude problem."],"Preet Bharara":["I don't like coffee but I need caffeine.","I'm a big fan of meat.","As the United States attorney in Manhattan, I have come to worry about few things as much as the gathering cyber threat.","The alarm bells sound regularly: cybergeddon; the next Pearl Harbor; one of the greatest existential threats facing the United States. With increasing frequency, these are the grave terms officials invoke about the menace of cybercrime - and they're not understating the threat.","History has shown that one cannot legislate a culture of integrity. And yet, one of the paramount responsibilities and challenges of corporate leadership is to ensure such a culture.","We have witnessed the most educated, successful, and monied professionals in the country put their companies - not to mention their own liberty - at risk by engaging in flagrant and foolhardy illegal conduct.","The aggressive use of wiretaps is important: It shows that we are targeting white-collar insider-trading rings with the same powerful investigative tools that have worked so successfully against the mob and drug cartels.","I eat almost no lunch. I have a big dinner but I don't have a big lunch.","I don't eat green things, no vegetables.","Unfortunately, from what I can see from my vantage point as the U.S. Attorney here, illegal insider trading is rampant and may even be on the rise.","In some respects, inside information is a form of financial steroid. It is unfair: it is offensive; it is unlawful; and it puts a black mark on the entire enterprise.","Businesses should be assured that law enforcement will operate with the utmost sensitivity toward victims of cyber attacks.","Significant officials at publicly traded companies are casually and cavalierly engaged in insider trading. Because insider trading has as one of its elements communication, it doesn't take rocket science to realize it's nice to have the communication on tape.","Insider trading tells everybody at precisely the wrong time that everything is rigged, and only people who have a billion dollars and have access to and are best friends with people who are on boards of directors of major companies - they're the only ones who can make a true buck.","Securities fraud generally and insider trading in particular should be eminently deterrable crimes.","I spoke bluntly about what I had seen in a little over a year as United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. To the apparent surprise of many in the room, I observed publicly that insider trading appeared to be rampant.","From coast to coast, the FBI and Securities and Exchange Commission have ensnared people not only at hedge funds, but at technology and pharmaceutical companies, consulting and law firms, government agencies, and even a major stock exchange."],"Preity Zinta":["People will always have an opinion, but you have to live life the way you want to. It's very easy to tell others what to do, but difficult to implement it on yourself.","When you step away from doing something that you have always been doing and then you return to it, you have a different perspective. You get that desire and the will to strike at everything.","I've never cheated or been cheated upon. I've seen my parents together and secure. So I feel the same way. Infidelity stems from low self-esteem. You want to cheat when you don't feel good about yourself.","I lost my father when I was 13 years old. He was a great man, my father, and very intelligent. I love him very much. I believe it's very important that parents have a personal connection with their children. It helps kids feel more secure, have a feeling of family, makes them feel loved.","If there is honesty in your face, the battle is won. It doesn't have to be the most beautiful face in the world. The audience can relate to you then. They feel love, not lust, for you.","I've learnt that there's a soul mate somewhere in this world. Till you don't find that person, the search goes on.","Luck always favours the brave. And you must remember that brave are the people who follow their heart; brave are the people who take chances in life. Which also means you have to say no sometimes. I believe the power of no is greater than yes.","If women want to be treated equally, then they can't ask for sops and whine about not being treated equally. All I'll say is no guts, no glory for men or women.","Two things in India are religion - one is cricket, and one is movies - these are two things.","My mother always tells me that when I was a little kid, my first ambition was to be a truck driver, and after that, I went through everything from wanting to be a Prime Minister to an air hostess, but never an actor. So I became one, and it was a great journey. I learnt a lot, worked very hard.","To act, you must know pain. You must know what it means to be in love, what it means to be rejected.","I think no one but me has the right to write about my life as I want to write it in a particular way. I don't think any other person will be able to tell the story of my life like how I have approached it. It works best when it's written by someone who has experienced it herself.","I am very reactive towards everything. There are some who don't react at all, they absorb everything quietly, while I'd go all out and show my expressions. This is not part of some tamasha I do; I do it because it's part of my personality. To each his own.","In my career as an actress, I have never got involved with anybody from the world of films. I have always kept my professional and personal life separate, as that's my policy.","What I've learnt is never to work with the person you are in a relationship with because sometimes you need a break.","I feel really humbled because I decided to go on Twitter, and all of my fans on Twitter say one thing consistently every single day, and that is, 'When are you coming back in movies?' I didn't even think people missed me that much.","I moved to cricket at a time when I was at the peak of my career, and I can guarantee you that no one else from Bollywood would have done that.","If some actress thinks she is sexy and she can dance, it's her choice. I do what I want to do, and I set my own benchmark. I will never compare myself with anyone.","In the end of the day, you are human. Film is a job which is not an individual job; you have tons and tons of people behind you - you have a whole crew of people working. But, an actor is the face of a film, so you get all of the good things, but you get the bad things, also.","There will always be competition, especially in showbiz. There's always someone younger and hungrier standing behind you; there's always someone with more contacts; there's always someone whose grandfather or father is a filmmaker. I think your job is just to be there 100% - you work hard, and there are no shortcuts to success.","Shopping is a lot of fun, but I hate trying on clothes because I think I've done too many costume fittings and trials. I hate trying on clothes. Shoes I love. I mean, I love shoes. Anywhere, any place, any time, you take me to a shoe store.","I have grown up in Delhi in a way, and I keep coming here often. But, and I am sorry to say, I'll always be nervous when in Delhi. In my college days, I have had my bum pinched around so many times. So yes, in Mumbai, I can just walk around and do what I want to do, but in Delhi I'll always be scared.","Film is my first love. It wasn't something I intended to fall in love with, but I grew to love it.","I'm not somebody who plans. There were times I planned a lot in my life, and it never turns out how you plan it. So I think it's important not to. I'm a very spontaneous person.","Yes, you have to be brave enough to take steps that your heart is telling you to take. Because when I decided to go into cricket, not one person told me I was making the right move. At that time, nobody thought the IPL would become so big. I was nervous at that time, because suddenly I was in an uncomfortable spot.","I am always friendly with people. When media asks me for a picture or interview, I readily do it. However, I wouldn't like them clicking my picture when I am eating or when I visit a temple. I don't want to be big in front of God.","I always follow my heart and my guts. If I want to do something, I have immense belief in hard work and myself. I have it in me to do well anywhere and in anything I do. I have a deep desire to excel in everything I do.","When I entered films, I rose to the top. In business, too, I want to be at the top.","You know what's the worst part about being an actress? It's the pressure to look gorgeous all the time and to behave perfectly. But I'm not perfect; nobody is.","Acting can truly take a toll on your nerves. I mean, we have to be larger than life. Worse, I've seen actors acting off the sets, too.","Films are a part of my being, they don't define me.","I have this whole thing that when God gives you more that you have imagined, you should give it back.","I cannot starve myself. I'm a foodie! I make fabulous pastas, Indian food, parathas and club sandwiches!","I stay away from negative relationships. They are energy-sapping vampires. I can't handle them.","I'm an actor, and I keep observing people and their reactions to figure out what they are thinking. There's only so much you can do on your own, so you have to keep learning. Art imitates life.","L.A. is wonderful. They have something called sleep dentistry. You just go there, and they put you to sleep and go, 'Drrrrrr,' and by the time you wake up a few hours later, you have a whole new set of teeth. I mean, whatever you want them to do.","In 2008, I just decided that there will come a time when I am dead and gone, and I only have a body of work to show. That was when I did films like 'Last Lear' and Deepa Mehta's 'Heaven On Earth.' They were serious roles.","I still love Delhi but get scared of the madness sometime. I know that my fans love me. But it gets a bit tough to handle when, in their excitement, they start touching and poking you to see if you're for real.","People in India like to touch a lot. It's not very nice for any girl to be touched by strangers wherever they want. You wouldn't do that to your sister or mother, but just because one is an actor, they think she is your property.","If I can be my crazy, wild self in front of a person, and he still likes me, that's romantic.","I'm glad I made business investments, because it gave me the confidence financially to make brave choices. If I hadn't done that, I'd still have been trying to play 19-year-olds in films. I know there are other avenues for me.","Just like a script, you need to keep a business plan to yourself.","I'd love to be an award-winning, commercial successful actress! I would love to push myself to the limits as an actress and experiment with playing really interesting women.","It's not that acting was something I'd always wanted to do. I had no formal training; I'd never really imagined I'd be an actress. Business was something that had always been in my mind, but when I got into acting, I learned everything on set, and for me at that point, I wanted to excel at what I did.","As an actress, I never went to film school, and I think if I had gone to film school, I would have started with a great advantage. If you have a strong intent to do anything in life, you can do it, but it always helps to have formal training."],"Prem Rawat":["Life is a tide; float on it. Go down with it and go up with it, but be detached. Then it is not difficult.","Happiness is your own treasure because it lies within you.","To the mind, God is a perfect criminal. He has done such a perfect crime by creating this world that mind cannot trace how He did it. That is why the mind always freaks out about God.","The greatest problem all around the world today, whether in America, Japan, China Russia, India or anywhere else in the world, is that people are not in peace. People want peace.","This life that has been given to us as a gift, as such a precious gift. To really try to understand it, really try to recognize it, is the greatest meditation. Through the media of this Knowledge we can tap into our inner sources that are so beautiful.","That peace which is within us, we must experience it. And if we are searching for peace outside we will never find the peace within.","I declare that I will establish peace in this world."],"Preneet Kaur":["Politics is a potent way to empower women.","Modi Model of Development is more a hype than reality, and the Congress has always stood for inclusive development.","Pakistani prisoners are safe in Indian jails. We are a responsible government.","India's dynamic growth, coupled with its large reservoir of skilled workforce, its commitment to democracy, and the rule of law, all taken together make India a very attractive investment destination.","The electricity tariff in Punjab is highest in north India, and it should be decreased.","Every time I have visited the U.S., I have been asked to let loose my hair and remove the hair pins. Each time, I have put up a defiant face.","The turban is an inextricable part of the Sikh identity. Sikhs say you may take off their head but not the turban.","Women are totally unsafe in Punjab.","The police in Punjab has been politicised; it has become a wing of the Akali Dal.","The Indian community in the U.K. has a unique place in our diaspora. U.K. is the first country which has an Indian community truly representative of its diversity.","While U.K. is one of India's most important trade and investment partners, India has become one of the largest investors in the U.K.","Over 600 Indian companies have opened their offices in U.K. and have secured the second highest number of jobs by a foreign employer in the U.K.","The total bogus voters in Dera Bassi might be several thousand.","When an Indian meets a terrorist, we condemn this.","The Indo-Canadian community has been a microcosm of the people of Indian origin living abroad besides reflecting India's diversity.","I still cherish the memory of walking into the Parliament for the first time.","It is very creditable when a woman gets into politics. She does this at the expense of responsibilities toward her home and family and should be lauded for this.","Women politicians take their job seriously and accomplish their duties diligently and sensitively. Only they can understand the problems of women and act as a sounding board for their concerns.","Women are as much politicians as men, and I hope that more and more women will enter public life through politics, as this would not only increase participation of women in public life but also have a salutary effect for the amelioration of women's status in India.","I look forward to the day when there are more women politicians accepted in their own right and not as 'women politicians.'"],"Prescott Bush":["I'm not a millionaire. I have a high earning power, but I never did have any capital.","I emphasize... that the Harrimans showed great courage and loyalty and confidence in us, because three or four of us were really running the business, the day to day business.","It is our conduct, our patriotism and belief in our American way of life, our courage that will win the final battle.","We must maintain strong defenses, military and spiritual.","We had representatives of most every ethnic group in the public school, and I always felt that this gave me a sense of balance about those ethnic problems that was useful to me in later life, and particularly in political life."],"Preston Brooks":["If I desired to kill the senator why did I not do it? You all admit that I had him in my power.","Whatever insults my State insults me.","I should have forfeited my own self-respect, and perhaps the good opinion of my countrymen, if I had failed to resent such an injury by calling the offender in question to a personal account.","But if I had committed a breach of privilege, it was the privilege of the Senate, and not of this House, which was violated. I was answerable there and not here.","But, sir, they have written me down upon the history of the country as worthy of expulsion, and in no unkindness I must tell them that for all future time my self-respect requires that I shall pass them as strangers.","They had no right, as it seems to me, to prosecute me in these Halls; nor have you the right in law or under the Constitution, as I respectfully submit, to take jurisdiction over offenses committed against them."],"Preston Manning":["When political and business leaders tell the public - any public - 'We don't trust you to make the right decision' - they prejudice that electorate against the very proposals they want it to accept and undermine public confidence in themselves.","When the initial effort of political and business leaders to influence public opinion on an issue is to threaten rather than to engage and persuade, they further arouse public opposition rather than win support.","There are more effective ways of tackling environmental problems including global warming, proliferation of plastics, urban sprawl, and the loss of biodiversity than by treaties, top-down regulations, and other approaches offered by big governments and their dependents.","Canada is the only country founded on the relentless pursuit of the rodent.","I guess I'd like to get old and die, in that order.","My personal political convictions are rooted in the populist political traditions of western Canada.","Do not ghettoize society by putting people into legal categories of gender, race, ethnicity, language, or other such characteristics.","The role of the federal government should be neutral toward culture just as it is toward religion.","There is a whole school of Canadian academics, media personalities, and politicians whose definition of a Canadian is a North American who fears or dislikes the United States.","For many years I have advocated 'redesigning Parliament' in a variety of ways - elect the Senate, do away with the 'confidence convention,' permit freer voting, strengthen the role of back benchers and committees, do away with ineffectual 'take note' debates, restructure question period, and so on.","When we classify an issue as a 'shield issue' it is usually because we feel that someone else occupies the high ground on that issue. We feel we can't win on that issue and so we adopt a defensive posture.","I was dissatisfied with the status quo back in the 80's, particularly how the West was represented in federation. I wanted to try to change it.","Remember the referendum on the Charlottetown constitutional accord? The more Canada's political and business elites threatened Canadians that the country would disappear into a black hole if the accord weren't passed, the more Canadians opposed it.","What used to be considered conservative values... are increasingly becoming more mainstream values."],"Preston Sturges":["It was actually the enormous risks I took with my pictures, skating right up to the edge of non-acceptance, that paid off so handsomely.","I never write down to my audiences. I respect honest sentiment and honest pratfalls.","I go through life accumulating possessions... I've always done it... and then, every once in a while, a sort of tidal wave comes along and washes them all away.","I am quite sure that a little man who braves ridicule to improve the lot of his fellow men, and is thanked by their jibes, is an interesting character.","The more nearly the film cutter approaches the natural law of interest, the more invisible will be his cutting. If the camera moves from one person to another at the exact moment that you in the legitimate theatre would have turned your head, you will not be conscious of a cut.","It is probably a very good thing for a boy to learn to live with enmity, as opposed to an atmosphere of love and affection, as it hardens him and gives him a taste of what he is going to run into later in life.","You can't go around the theatres handing out cards saying, 'It isn't my fault'. You go onto the next one.","I did all my directing when I wrote the screenplay. It was probably harder for a regular director. He probably had to read the script the night before shooting started.","I am, of course, directly descended from Brian Boru, the last king of Ireland, a fact certified by my mother and therefore beyond dispute. But as everybody else with a drop of Irish blood in his carcass is also a guaranteed descendant of the old billy goat, I am not overly arrogant because of this royal strain.","Despite my express wish, I was not left in Chicago, but taken to Paris to live, and I did not see my father for many years. But we never stopped loving each other, and in 1940 he died in my arms in Hollywood, where he had come to be near me at the end.","Our gymnasium was remarkable and had more stuff in it than one could dream up in a nightmare. Furthermore, every boy had to use every piece of it during gymnasium class.","Of the Sturges family, much more is known than is available about poor Irish immigrants and obscure Scottish-English settlers around Rochester.","According to my mother, positively no one, least of all herself, had even the faintest suspicion that she was heavy with child at the time of my birth.","For a southern belle, my grandmother was remarkably modern. She threw my grandfather out, for one thing - some kind of argument about bourbon whiskey - shortly after the birth of their third child, and then went back to school to get herself a teaching certificate.","Paris Singer had vastly more to do with shaping my character than Mother had; although Mother made innumerable sacrifices for me, and Paris Singer made none. I wanted to be like him.","Though I believe in God, I don't believe in religion for everybody. Some people who are a little weak and don't want to shoulder any responsibility need Catholicism. For people at the other extreme, there is Christian Science... I think a powerful conscience is worth all the religions put together.","I always was and always will be optimistic.","If I can't find real situations that interest me in real life, then I'll go and write them in play form.","The more you stand in the limelight, the more scarred you will become and the more you will love the limelight.","How many years and how many pictures does it take to win the confidence of Paramount? How many years before my fellow workers say, 'I know he is doing his best?'","I thought for a month or so along the lines of what I call Monsieur Beaucaire in modern clothes. By that, I mean a hero who is believed by all to be a villain but who, in the end, is introduced as a man of great honor with a long list of decorations.","The United States owes a great debt to its inventors. Far from being grateful to them, it places every obstruction in their way and makes it enormously difficult to secure a patent.","If war is the solution, why didn't Roosevelt declare war on poverty?","I worked out a rather deep-dish theory defining the theater as a form of architecture rather than a form of literature.","I compared pooh-poohers of the movies to the myopics who used to holler, 'Get a horse!' when an early automobile exploded by.","I did not think that a good movie was the equivalent of a good stage play, any more than I thought an automobile ride was as exhilarating as a drive behind a spirited horse, nor a trip by steam as soul-satisfying as a voyage by sail.","Theater in which you eat is the oldest form of theater.","I don't believe environment has the slightest bit to do with anything - I only believe in ancestral influence. It would have made no difference whether I'd been brought up in a reform school, or on the island of Lesbos.","The camera must point at the exact spot the audience wishes to look at any given moment. To find that spot is absurdly easy: you only have to remember where you were looking at the time the scene was made.","I have always wondered why the movie industry was so firmly persuaded that the original author could be of no possible help in the case of a remake or any other change in a work.","I have never done anything but my very best work for anyone, and to do this and retain my first fine enthusiasm over a period of thirty years has required a rather special set of working conditions.","Directing was easy for me because I was a writer director and did all my directing when I wrote the screenplay.","By the very nature of his art, which depends on invention and innovation, a story teller must depart from the beaten track and, having done so, occasionally startle and disagree with some of his associates. Healthy disagreement we must have.","The hook is a word or an idea spoken by one character which gives the next character something to hook onto when he responds or, like a trapeze artist, gives him something to swing from on his way to another point of view.","In 'Remember the Night,' love reformed her and corrupted him, which gave us the finely balanced moral that one man's meat is another man's poison.","Much as I disliked the un-American idea of marrying a lady with a dowry, I must admit that little Mrs. Godfrey's little private income put everything in a faintly different light."],"Primo Angeli":["A great trademark is appropriate, dynamic, distinctive, memorable and unique.","It can't be stressed enough that in order to produce great graphics, you have to have a good product and a good client capable of making decisions.","The talent for discovering the unique and marketable characteristics of a product and service is a designer's most valuable asset."],"Primo Levi":["Human memory is a marvelous but fallacious instrument. The memories which lie within us are not carved in stone; not only do they tend to become erased as the years go by, but often they change, or even increase by incorporating extraneous features.","Anyone who has obeyed nature by transmitting a piece of gossip experiences the explosive relief that accompanies the satisfying of a primary need.","The aims of life are the best defense against death.","I live in my house as I live inside my skin: I know more beautiful, more ample, more sturdy and more picturesque skins: but it would seem to me unnatural to exchange them for mine."],"Prince Andrew":["It's almost a responsibility for all the people of the United Kingdom, regardless of race, color or creed, and an understanding that you have an individual connection with each and every one.","People say to me, 'Would you like to swap your life with me for 24 hours? Your life must be very strange.'","Today is reality. Yesterday is history.","I've always been told I was extremely well-behaved as a kid.","You, I, we all encounter behaviors that we might say, I wouldn't do that. But she has a huge amount of contact with how people live. She sees more hospices and sink estates than most people.","She is incredibly fit, but we remind staff that she's not just the monarch, but our mother.","When the question arose whether I, as a member of the royal family, should take part in active combat in the Falklands, there was no question in her mind, and it only took her two days to sort the issue.","Her friends say she is very funny. At a family dinner, she stood to go, and the footman very properly pulled her chair away. At that moment I asked her a question and she sat down again, except there was no chair. Everyone, including the Queen, laughed and laughed.","The Queen's intelligence network is a hell of a lot better than anyone's in this palace. Bar none. She knows everything. I don't know how she does it. And she sees everything.","Sarah will talk to me about someone and I don't know who she's talking about, but if she talks to my mother, the two of them will know exactly - and across several generations, too.","People say to me, Would you like to swap your life with me for 24 hours? Your life must be very strange. But of course I have not experienced any other life. It's not strange to me.","It's slightly complicated for people to grasp the idea of a head of state in human form.","We've had American TV shows in Britain for years and that hasn't affected our culture at all.","I look at Canada like a second home.","The Royal Family have always had an interest in a number of different areas of society. We are a part of society.","I could have worse tags than 'Airmiles Andy' - although I don't know what they are.","It would not be a bad idea if bankers were to go and sit occasionally with politicians in their political surgeries, where they might get a sense of the injustice that some of the community feel about the banks.","I'll tell you where the injustice is. It's with the person earning £12,000 to £15,000-a-year who is being asked to be restrained by their business or employer. Yet the taxpayer has bailed out the banks, so why are they not showing restraint?","I'm in a privileged position and I'm going to do my utmost to use that privileged position on behalf of the U.K., its citizens, its businesses and people."],"Prince Charles":["Something as curious as the monarchy won't survive unless you take account of people's attitudes. After all, if people don't want it, they won't have it.","I learned the way a monkey learns - by watching its parents.","We're busily wrecking the chances for future generations at a rapid rate of knots by not recognizing the damage we're doing to the natural environment, bearing in mind that this is the only planet that we know has any life on it.","Do you seriously expect me to be the first Prince of Wales in history not to have a mistress?","Your greatest achievement is to love me.","Father told me that if I ever met a lady in a dress like yours, I must look her straight in the eyes.","Hong Kong has created one of the most successful societies on Earth.","There's nothing like a jolly good disaster to get people to start doing something.","I believe passionately that everyone has a particular God-given ability.","You have to give this much to the Luftwaffe: when it knocked down our buildings it did not replace them with anything more offensive than rubble. We did that.","As you may possibly have noticed from time to time, I have tended to make a habit of sticking my head above the parapet and generally getting it shot off for pointing out what has always been blindingly obvious to me.","The whole imposing edifice of modern medicine is like the celebrated tower of Pisa - slightly off balance.","Perhaps it has been too uncomfortable for those with vested interests to acknowledge, but we have spent the best part of the past century enthusiastically testing the world to utter destruction; not looking closely enough at the long-term impact our actions will have.","I sometimes wonder if two thirds of the globe is covered in red carpet.","That's called a microphone. It's a big sausage that picks up everything you say - and you're starting early.","All the time I feel I must justify my existence.","I'd rather go by bus.","We would never comment on private correspondence.","It is baffling, I must say, that in our modern world we have such blind trust in science and technology that we all accept what science tells us about everything - until, that is, it comes to climate science.","I have for some time now been deeply troubled by the growing difficulties faced by Christian communities in various parts of the Middle East. It seems to me that we cannot ignore the fact that Christians in the Middle East are increasingly being deliberately targeted by fundamentalist Islamist militants.","Christianity was literally born in the Middle East, and we must not forget our Middle Eastern brothers and sisters in Christ."],"Prince Fielder":["You don't have to look like an Under Armour mannequin to be an athlete. A lot of people probably think I'm not athletic or don't even try to work out or whatever, but I do. Just because you're big doesn't mean you can't be an athlete. And just because you work out doesn't mean you're going to have a 12-pack.","When I first started swinging a bat, I swung righty. So one time, my dad came home, and he wanted to see my batting stance. So I showed him. He says, 'You don't hit right-handed. You hit left-handed.' At that age I didn't even really think about it. Just like 'all right,' and I switched hands. He said I'd thank him later.","I like pasta; it's pretty good. I'll even substitute wheat pasta in there and make it more healthy.","When you cut your hair, everybody thinks you lost weight.","The gummy bears tattoo was my idea. It's my son's favorite candy. The sketch was my other son's idea. It's a self-portrait of himself. I just showed the artist his sketch and had him tattoo it on my forearm. It looks like a stick person with big hair. It's pretty funny.","When I was 12, I was taking batting practice with an aluminum bat at Tiger Stadium. I don't know where it landed exactly, but upper deck somewhere. Yeah, people were surprised.","In 2007, I hit 50 home runs. That was pretty cool. I never thought I'd be able to do that. At the time, I didn't even think it was that big of a deal for some reason. But now, looking back, I realize it was pretty cool.","Scales are not allowed in my house.","I could dunk a volleyball in high school. I didn't play football because I knew they were going to put me at a fat-guy position, and I didn't want to do that. I am athletic.","Yeah, I'm a vegetarian - but still, some things are just nasty. I like salads. But sometimes, they get too creative. I like regular food, just no meat in it.","I like beans. Lentils are beans, right? I love beans and rice."],"Prince Harry":["Once you're in the military, she means a lot more to you than just a grandmother. She is the queen. And then you suddenly, it's like start realizing, you know, wow, this is quite a big deal. And then you get goose bumps and then the rest of it.","I get a huge buzz from spending time with kids.","There's a lot of times that both myself and my brother wish, obviously, that we were just completely normal.","Anyone who says they don't enjoy the Army is mad - you can spend a week hating it and the next week it could be the best thing in the world and the best job you could ever, ever wish for. It has got so much to offer.","I've longed for kids since I was very, very young. And so... I'm waiting to find the right person, someone who's willing to take on the job.","Conversations with my mother, father, my grandparents, as I've grown up have obviously driven me towards wanting to try and make a difference as much as possible.","You've got to give something back. You can't just sit there.","I'm still very much a kid inside myself.","To be honest dinner conversations was the worst bit about being a child and listening to the boring people around me.","You can imagine the kind of dinner parties I had to go to at a young age... pretty dull.","I've served my country.","I've longed for kids since I was very, very young.","For me personally, as I said, I want to serve my country. I've done it once, and I'm still in the army, I feel as though I should get the opportunity to do it again."],"Prince Philip":["When a man opens a car door for his wife, it's either a new car or a new wife.","A gun is no more dangerous than a cricket bat in the hands of a madman.","Everybody was saying we must have more leisure. Now they are complaining they are unemployed.","The man who invented the red carpet needed his head examined.","We don't come to Canada for our health. We can think of other ways of enjoying ourselves.","I don't think a prostitute is more moral than a wife, but they are doing the same thing."],"Prince Royce":["I just think Valentine's Day is a day to really appreciate the person you love, no matter who it is, and to spend time with them. I don't think it's all about fancy presents or whatever. I think it's about spending that quality time with that special person.","I represent New York, I represent the Bronx, I represent the Dominican Republic. And I always have that in mind with everything that I do.","I grew up having two different perspectives - one in English, one in Spanish. Two different cultures, very different - but I think that, to me, it's one. I'm just as American as I feel Latin.","I try to always motivate young kids who want to be singers or actors or whatever it is they want to be that anything is possible with hard work. It doesn't matter where you're from or what language you speak - as long as you work hard, you can achieve those goals.","Most of my fans know I love video games. I say it in every interview, so they know. But one thing that I like doing is skateboarding, I like jet skiing, skydiving. It's like a huge roller coaster ride. Like forty seconds of free-falling. That's some of the stuff I love, daredevil stuff. I like horseback riding.","I'm not here to try and replace anyone or compete with anyone.","I think that Valentine's Day is only as good as you want it to be. You know, I don't think it should be anything fancy, nothing crazy. As long as you're spending time with that person that's special, I think that's a great Valentine's Day.","Every time I collaborate with an artist, I want to surprise fans. I want to do something new.","Everything in life is a risk! I mean, you walk out onto the street and it's a risk! Don't you think?","I like Miami in the winter: there's no humidity, no bugs, no mosquitoes. You go out and wear your jacket, and you're all good!","Girls love emotion.","When I was working at the Sprint store, I got laid off. I was bummed out, but I stayed positive. I used the money I had earned while working there to make my first album. Without that job, maybe 'Corazon Sin Cara' would never had been made. It's a very inspirational story.","I love hip-hop, R&B, techno and Latin.","I grew up playing basketball and eating hot dogs on the corner.","I spoke English at school and Spanish at home, and I'm always eating Dominican food, listening to Dominican music.","There's just something about being on stage and being with the people that, once that camera turns on, you find the strength to keep it cool, look good, act like you're not cold, act like you ain't nervous, act like you aren't scared. I think that comes with confidence and practice.","I would definitely love to work with somebody like Jay Z or Rihanna.","My dream girl... well, I love eyes. And lips. She has to have nice lips!","I'm very clumsy, so there's been a lot of times I've tripped in front of girls I'm in love with or spilled food all over myself.","My friends and I were the class clowns in high school, so one day we were showing off at our seats, and I fell off my chair! I had to get stitches, and I had a bloody lip. I was trying so hard to be a cool class clown!","I think when you translate songs, you lose the real essence and the meaning.","My Valentine's playlist... you're gonna have to play some Ginuwine. You're gonna have to play some 112. You're gonna have to play some Confession - Usher's - back in the day. You know, a little bit of Prince Royce there, too.","I don't think I've ever had a bad Valentine's Day, I mean... c'mon, y'all know I never get a bad Valentine. Nah. Um, no, I've never really had - I don't have a bad Valentine's Day. I never really think... it doesn't come up to my mind.","I remember when I was working at Sprint, I'd work on my birthday, New Year's Day, and even Christmas Eve. I'm just used to working on my birthday, so I'll be celebrating it afterward.","Media always comments if I wear the same thing twice.","I grew up in The Bronx. I mean, I was born and raised in New York City. And I started singing in Spanish because I was always just connected to my Latin roots.","My parents are Dominican. I would always go to the Dominican Republic, and I fell in love with Bachata, which comes from the Dominican Republic.","I sang in English my whole life; I just happened to decide that I had a passion for Latin music, and I wanted to jump into Latin music first.","I go skydiving often. At least twice a year.","All my fans are my girlfriends.","I think behind every great man there's got to be a great woman, whether she's your wife, your girlfriend or not. I'm not gonna say that there's not that special girl out there. But I'm in the music biz, and I'm focused on the music.","I grew up listening to a lot of Usher at 13 and 14. I have every Usher album that ever existed. So I grew up listening to a lot of Usher, Michael Jackson, Luis Miguel, a lot of pioneers in Latin music.","I like eating; I like going to restaurants and trying new things.","I just want to bring the people good music.","I wouldn't say I'm changing myself to find a new audience. It's about growing, trying new things. There's a whole other world out there that doesn't know who Prince Royce is.","Spanish is my second language. When I started, I was doing interviews in Spanish and had to catch up.","In Spanish, I record a lot of single-voice tracks, and in English, I 'stack' a lot of voices, so it's very different, and I think I got so used to recording in Spanish for six years that it was really refreshing and challenging to get in and record 'Double Vision' in English.","My intent is never to leave Latin music. I definitely still want to release bachata albums.","As a Latin musician, I understand that there are so many places where people don't know who I am. My albums never came out in Australia or Japan.","My parents and grandparents listened to bacheta heavy, the true bachata from back in the day - Juan Luis Guerra, Anthony Santos. I liked the genre, but I remember thinking, 'OK, enough of this.' I would sing Usher's 'U Remind Me' to the girls in school.","I sang everything - R&B slow jams, Spanish slow jams, romantic reggaeton - and I really didn't care which I got signed for.","At 17, I was working at Sprint in the Bronx so I could make money to fund my own music.","Bachata is expensive to produce because of all of the instruments.","I'm excited to be launching D'Leon Records to support other young talent in their development. I have been very fortunate to have been able to break through and succeed in this tough industry, and this is one of my ways of giving back.","I feel blessed to even be able to put out an English album. Not too many Latin artists get the opportunity to come out and record another genre that's so different to Bachata.","I always sang in English. It's just that nobody heard me.","The way I think or sing about something is very different if it is in Spanish or English.","My whole life, I grew up with this double vision, this vision of America but also Latin community.","I love American food, but I also love Latin food.","In Spanish, for whatever reason, I lean more toward the high notes.","When I hear the songs 'Dangerous' or 'End of My World', I go, 'Wow, I didn't even know I could go that low!' And when I played them for my family, they said, 'That doesn't even sound like you.'"],"Prince William":["My guiding principles in life are to be honest, genuine, thoughtful and caring.","I hope I'm not a tourist attraction - I'm sure that they come here really because St. Andrews is just amazing, a beautiful place.","As I learned from growing up, you don't mess with your grandmother.","Only the mad girls chase me, I think.","I think it's very important that you make your own decision about what you are. Therefore you're responsible for your actions, so you don't blame other people.","When the Queen says 'well done,' it means so much.","I'm reasonably headstrong about what I believe in, and what I go for, and I've got fantastic people around me who give me great support and advice.","There are times where you can't do it yourself and the system takes over, or it's appropriate to do things differently. But I think driving your son and your wife away from hospital was really important to me.","I have to say that I thought search-and-rescue duties over Snowdonia were physically and mentally demanding, but looking after a 3-week-old baby is up there!","I've had lots of kids come up and ask for my autograph, I've had a grandmother stop me and ask me if I know a good place to buy underwear.","We'll sort of get over the marriage first and then maybe look at the kids. But obviously we want a family so we'll have to start thinking about that.","People say it's not ambitious, but it is actually quite ambitious wanting to help people.","No one is going to try to fill my mother's shoes, what she did was fantastic. It's about making your own future and your own destiny and Kate will do a very good job of that.","I just want to go to university and have fun - I want to be an ordinary student. I'm only going to university. It's not like I'm getting married - though that's what it feels like sometimes.","You hear a lot of horror stories about proposing and things going horribly wrong - it went really, really well and I was really pleased when she said yes.","I'm probably a bit of a cheeky grandson, like my brother as well. We both take the mickey a bit too much.","I am as independent as I want to be, same as Catherine and Harry. We've all grown up differently to other generations and I very much feel if that I can do it myself, I want to do it myself.","I'm probably a bit of a cheeky grandson like my brother as well. We both tend to take the mickey a bit much.","It's like a rugby team. If you're picking for the World Cup final, you're picking experience with youth. Everything is better off having that balance and that mix. I think that, especially, goes for the monarchy as well.","There's no pressure; like Kate said, it is about carving your own future. No one is going to try to fill my mother's shoes; what she did was fantastic. It's about making your own future and your own destiny, and Kate will do a very good job of that.","I'm still trying to decide. It's a really difficult one because I really enjoy my time in the Air Force. And I'd love to continue it. But the pressures of my other life are building. And fighting them off or balancing the two of them has proven quite difficult.","I'm always open for people saying I'm wrong because most of the time I am.","I am and always will be an HRH. But out of personal choice I like to be called William because that is my name and I want people to call me William - for now.","There's been a lot of speculation about every single girl I'm with and it actually does quite irritate me after a while, more so because it's a complete pain for the girls.","It's my mother's engagement ring so I thought it was quite nice because obviously she's not going to be around to share any of the fun and excitement of it all - this was my way of keeping her close to it all.","I get quite lazy about cooking because when I come back from work it is the last thing I want to do, really is spend loads of time cooking.","When I was younger and my parents used to always slap my hand if I was picking my nose or if I was running around screaming I was told to shut up.","Being a small boy it's very daunting seeing the Queen around and not really quite knowing what to talk about.","I always remember having a healthy respect for my grandmother.","As any new parent knows, you're only too happy to show off your new child and, you know, proclaim that he is the best looking or the best everything.","My relationship with my grandmother has gone from strength to strength. As a shy, younger man it could be harder to talk about weighty matters. It was: 'This is my grandmother who is the Queen, and these are serious historical subjects.'","My grandmother certainly does not care for celebrity.","I'm just very keen to have a family and both Catherine and I, you know, are looking forward to having a family in the future."],"Prince":["Every day I feel is a blessing from God. And I consider it a new beginning. Yeah, everything is beautiful.","I like constructive criticism from smart people.","Technology is cool, but you've got to use it as opposed to letting it use you.","Sometimes ideas are coming so fast that I have to stop doing one song to get another. But I don't forget the first one. If it works, it will always be there. It's like the truth: it will find you and lift you up. And if it ain't right, it will dissolve like sand on the beach.","There's a dark side to everything.","The hardest thing with musicians is getting them not to play.","Art is about building a new foundation, not just laying something on top of what's already there.","My hair is capable of doing a lot of different things.","To create something from nothing is one of the greatest feelings, and I would - I don't know, I wish it upon everybody. It's heaven.","So much has been written about me, and people don't know what's right and what's wrong. I'd rather let them stay confused.","Instead of hate, celebrate.","I'm a fighter. I'm very competitive.","Despite everything, no one can dictate who you are to other people.","No one can come and claim ownership of my work. I am the creator of it, and it lives within me.","I like Hollywood. I just like Minneapolis a little bit better.","I like to open people's eyes.","A strong spirit transcends rules.","If you lend your consciousness to someone else, you're a robot.","People say I'm wearing heels because I'm short. I wear heels because the women like 'em.","You can always tell when the groove is working or not.","I don't talk to old people; they try to find ways to stay static. Young folks are the ones with the ideas and constantly moving forward.","YouTube is the hippest network, and they abuse copyright right and left.","Music is real. It affects people; it's real.","Time is a mind construct. It's not real.","The music industry is a matrix that is counter to what is natural and right.","Young people have decided they like to listen to music in a certain way, through ear buds, and that's fine with me as long as it doesn't bother them that they're not hearing 90 percent of the music that way.","I've always understood the two to be intertwined: sexuality and spirituality. That never changed.","I don't want anyone to fail, so if you can make money off music even though you can't sing or dance, that's genius.","You don't need a record company to turn you into anything.","Most bands out there are basically pretty boring. I try to affect people inside their bodies.","If you look in the Bible there's no birthdays.","I have friends that are gay, and we study the Bible together.","When I started playing music, people weren't selling 5 million records. That was not the standard; that was not the focus.","I'm not entangled in a bunch of lawsuits and a web that I can't get out of. I can hold my head up... a happily married man who has his head in order. There isn't a bunch of scandal in my life.","I pushed the envelope as far as it needed to be pushed, and now it's on the floor, and people seem to want it to stay there.","I don't live in the past. I don't play my old records for that reason. I make a statement, then move on to the next.","The music, for me, doesn't come on a schedule. I don't know when it's going to come, and when it does, I want it out.","When I first started out in this music industry, I was most concerned with freedom. Freedom to produce, freedom to play all the instruments on my records, freedom to say anything I wanted to.","I've never stopped writing, never stopped recording.","When you sit down to write something, there should be no guidelines. The main idea is not supposed to be, 'How many different ways can we sell it?' That's so far away from the true spirit of what music is.","Everyone has a rock bottom.","The key to longevity is to learn every aspect of music that you can.","I always knew I had a relationship with God. But I wasn't sure God had a relationship with me.","There's this thing called compulsory licensing law that allows artists through the record companies to take your music at will without your permission.","Like books and black lives, albums still matter.","People don't understand real musicians anymore. Jack White is great - he's the real thing - but he isn't having hits.","Well, my musicians are my friends.","There's not a lot of pop music in the mainstream that makes you feel scared, that makes you wonder what's happening.","Contrary to what a lot of people think, I haven't been domesticated.","Music is music, ultimately. If it makes you feel good, cool.","I learned from Jimi Hendrix. They all wanted him to do the tricks, and at the end of his career, he just wanted to play. I lived longer than he did, and I can see how those pressures can really play with your head.","Being a Jehovah's Witness, I don't celebrate birthdays or holidays. I don't vote.","Each audience is different.","I might just stop talking again and not do interviews.","When I found out that there was eight Presidents before George Washington, I wanted to smack somebody.","Prophecy is what we all have to go by now.","Every year, they ask me to play the Grammys.","My father left his piano at the house when he left, and I wasn't allowed to play it when he was there because I wasn't as good as him. So when he left, I was determined to get as good as him, and I taught myself how to play music, and I just stuck with it, and I did it all the time.","People speculate on your personal life all the time anyway. So I just think it's important to keep my private life private and my public persona more into music, you know?","There are people who are unhappy with everything.","The Bible is a study guide for social interaction.","All these non-singing, non-dancing, wish-I-had-me-some-clothes fools who tell me my albums suck. Why should I pay any attention to them?","Most people don't want to talk about politics and religion. They say, 'Let's talk about something else.'","Too much freedom can lead to the soul's decay.","I have a writing addiction.","Just sharing music with each other - that's cool. It's the selling that becomes the problem.","Most artists lose their voice, their hair, and their bands. That's not going to happen to me.","I'm thankful enough or blessed enough to be able to say that Miles Davis was a friend when he was alive, and he was a wonderful mentor and really, really funny, you know.","I learned from Jehovah's Witnesses that a fatalistic view is counterproductive.","It gets embarrassing to say something untrue because you put it online and everyone knows about it, so it's better to tell the truth.","What's missing from pop music is danger.","All you see on television are debased images.","The gatekeepers must change.","'Billboard' needs to tell the truth, shake things up.","Oh, I love critics. Because they love me. It's not a joke. They care.","My mother told me one day I walked in to her and said, 'Mom, I'm not going to be sick anymore,' and she said 'Why?' and I said 'Because an angel told me so.' Now, I don't remember saying it; that's just what she told me.","When it comes to the video channels and the programs, the radio stations, the music is geared towards kids, and it's made by kids.","'When Doves Cry' came out - it sounded like nothing that was on the radio. 'Let's Go Crazy' was number one on R&B stations, and there's nothing that's been like that on radio since.","I'm a Jehovah's Witness.","I don't talk about the past.","Anyway, all these computers and digital gadgets are no good. They just fill your head with numbers and that can't be good for you.","I used to have seizures when I was young. My mother and father didn't know what to do or how to handle it but they did the best they could with what little they had.","I really believe in finding new ways to distribute my music.","The internet's completely over.","I don't see why I should give my new music to iTunes or anyone else. They won't pay me an advance for it and then they get angry when they can't get it.","It's fun being in Islamic countries, to know there's only one religion. There's order. You wear a burqa. There's no choice. People are happy with that.","I'm real easy-going.","I ain't mad at anybody. I don't have any enemies.","I don't vote and I got nothing to do with it.","When everyone recognizes Jehovah's name, then everyone will be happy because everyone will know what to do and how to do it.","I used to be more involved with every aspect of everything onstage. I'm way more relaxed now. It feels like anything can happen.","At one time, MTV was hip and suddenly it became outdated.","Doing a residency in any particular city requires a large repertoire to ensure repeat business.","I like arguments.","In the tech-savvy, real-time world we all live in today, everything is faster.","From its conception and that one and only meeting, 'HITNRUN' took about 90 days to prepare its release. If that's what freedom feels like, 'HITNRUN' is what it sounds like.","I have a lot of parties.","I do pay performance royalties on others' songs I perform live, but I'm not recording these songs and putting them up for sale.","Nobody sues their fans.","You don't have to watch 'Gossip Girl' to have an attitude.","A bootlegger is a bootlegger, a scalper is a scalper.","I'm not one to get bad reviews.","Tell me a musician who's got rich off digital sales. Apple's doing pretty good though, right?","I became merely a pawn used to produce more money for Warner Bros.","Record contracts are just like - I'm gonna say the word - slavery. I would tell any young artist... don't sign.","I think you'll always be able to do what your ear tells you.","We have to show support for artists who are trying to own things for themselves.","You ever get that feeling that you just have too many hits?","It might be a shock to see me, but that's no reason for people to act crazy, and it doesn't give them license to chase me down the street.","My bankers are very happy with me.","Any business situation is restrictive.","It's work to play the same songs the same way for 70 shows.","I pride myself on working with great musicians.","When you don't talk down to your audience, then they can grow with you.","I don't know who was the one that came up with the notion that you have to play the same songs every concert.","Hip-hop is very diverse, but if you only focus on one aspect of it, then what you get is this image of Black America that is completely contrary to what actually goes on.","There are no great jazz-fusion bands.","I record all the time.","You can't understand the words of Cocteau Twins songs, but their harmonies put you in a dreamlike state.","I always wanted to make a three-record set. 'Sign o' the Times' was originally supposed to be a triple album, but it ended up as a double."],"Princess Anne":["You are a pest, by the very nature of that camera in your hand.","Golf seems to be an arduous way to go for a walk. I prefer to take the dog's out.","I know my own heart to be entirely English.","When I appear in public people expect me to neigh, grind my teeth, paw the ground and swish my tail - none of which is easy."],"Princess Beatrice of York":["Learning is the gateway to adventure.","You have to find an identity that's true to yourself. You really have to find your own voice.","I am greatly honoured to become Patron of The Helen Arkell Dyslexia Centre. I have benefited hugely from their work, and I am looking forward to supporting them in giving a chance to others to benefit from their experience and teaching.","I know I'm very lucky. A lot of it is quite normal, scooting around the supermarket with a shopping trolley and things like that. With one parent being a prince and the other being an amazing sort of... business woman.","For me, school was a nightmare. I struggled.","My earliest memory is trying to read Beatrix Potter, and the words were literally jumping off the page.","I was diagnosed with dyslexia when I was seven, and it was a bit of a struggle to begin with. It was a challenge as I began my school career - spelling and reading was something I couldn't really get my head around.","When I was younger, I was diagnosed with dyslexia, which meant, for me, sitting in front of a book was really hard - until I discovered Harry Potter, and this character, this 11-year-old boy, who suddenly gets off to school for the first time, captured my imagination, and suddenly reading was fun. Reading was inspiring, and I was motivated.","Britain has trend-setting fashion, ground-breaking scientists, and innovative technology companies. It is also a welcome home for investors."],"Princess Diana":["Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you.","Family is the most important thing in the world.","I don't go by the rule book... I lead from the heart, not the head.","If you find someone you love in your life, then hang on to that love.","I like to be a free spirit. Some don't like that, but that's the way I am.","Hugs can do great amounts of good - especially for children.","I think the biggest disease the world suffers from in this day and age is the disease of people feeling unloved. I know that I can give love for a minute, for half an hour, for a day, for a month, but I can give. I am very happy to do that, I want to do that.","Being a princess isn't all it's cracked up to be.","They say it is better to be poor and happy than rich and miserable, but how about a compromise like moderately rich and just moody?","Everyone of us needs to show how much we care for each other and, in the process, care for ourselves.","HIV does not make people dangerous to know, so you can shake their hands and give them a hug: Heaven knows they need it.","Only do what your heart tells you.","Anywhere I see suffering, that is where I want to be, doing what I can.","People think that at the end of the day a man is the only answer. Actually, a fulfilling job is better for me.","Nothing brings me more happiness than trying to help the most vulnerable people in society. It is a goal and an essential part of my life - a kind of destiny. Whoever is in distress can call on me. I will come running wherever they are.","The greatest problem in the world today is intolerance. Everyone is so intolerant of each other.","I want my boys to have an understanding of people's emotions, their insecurities, people's distress, and their hopes and dreams.","I knew what my job was; it was to go out and meet the people and love them.","When you are happy you can forgive a great deal.","I want to walk into a room, be it a hospital for the dying or a hospital for the sick children, and feel that I am needed. I want to do, not just to be.","I wear my heart on my sleeve.","So many people supported me through my public life and I will never forget them.","I don't want expensive gifts; I don't want to be bought. I have everything I want. I just want someone to be there for me, to make me feel safe and secure.","I live for my sons. I would be lost without them.","You can't comfort the afflicted with afflicting the comfortable.","I'm as thick as a plank.","I'd like to be a queen in people's hearts but I don't see myself being queen of this country.","There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.","Life is just a journey.","It's vital that the monarchy keeps in touch with the people. It's what I try and do.","The biggest disease this day and age is that of people feeling unloved.","The kindness and affection from the public have carried me through some of the most difficult periods, and always your love and affection have eased the journey.","What must it be like for a little boy to read that daddy never loved mummy?","I will fight for my children on any level so they can reach their potential as human beings and in their public duties.","I think like any marriage, especially when you've had divorced parents like myself; you want to try even harder to make it work.","I'm aware that people I have loved and have died and are in the spirit world looking after me.","I don't even know how to use a parking meter, let alone a phone box.","If men had to have babies, they would only ever have one each.","Any sane person would have left long ago. But I cannot. I have my sons."],"Princess Eugenie of York":["When I was 12, I had an operation at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, and they corrected the curving in my spine. I've got two 12-inch rods and eight screws going up my back keeping me straight, and they fuse together with my spine, so now I can't really live without them.","Whenever Granny walks into a room, everyone stands up, stops, and just kind of watches her because, obviously, it's huge when she walks into a room. And I find that incredible. I kind of go, 'Ah.'","Beatrice loves her glamorous dresses and her hair being curly or big - like Mummy's - and I hate volume. I like my hair to be sort of flat. I like just throwing on a pair of jeans and generally being more understated. She is more 'Let's do the glamour.' We're chalk and cheese.","How do I play the princess thing? I don't, really. I don't like talking about it much and find it annoying when people say things like, 'Oh, you're the princess.' One of my best friends jokingly says, 'Hi, Princess,' and I say, 'Shut up.' It is one of the things that bugs me most in the world.","I do have an occasional temper - I sort of inherited my dad's short fuse.","Mummy, Bea and I call ourselves 'the Tripod' - they are my best friends in the world.","I so want to be able to speak another language. I love the way my friends who are half Italian and half English break from one language into another without even pausing.","I did art history and English literature at Newcastle.","Doing art at Marlborough, where I went to school, was really quite tough, and I knew that it wasn't the direction I wanted to go. I'd rather show art and give people the joy of seeing it.","I am definitely not as polite as Beatrice, I have to say. I tell it as it is. I am shyer at first.","Without the care I received at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, I wouldn't look the way I do now; my back would be hunched over."],"Princess Margaret":["When my sister and I were growing up, she was made out to be the goody-goody one.","The Queen is the only person who can put on a tiara with one hand, while walking down stairs.","My children are not royal; they just happen to have the Queen for their aunt.","I have no intention of telling people what I have for breakfast.","I have always had a dread of becoming a passenger in life.","I'm the heir apparent to the heir presumptive.","I have as much privacy as a goldfish in a bowl.","I would like it to be known that I have decided not to marry Group Capt. Peter Townsend. Mindful of the church's teaching that Christian marriage is indissoluble, and conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have resolved to put these considerations before any others.","I am deeply grateful for the concern of all those who constantly prayed for my happiness."],"Priscilla Ahn":["Growing up in a multicultural family, I never really felt that I was different - even though I was from most of the kids in my school. Especially with music, I try to just approach it as an equal.","Because when does anybody really grow up? I mean, I feel more grown up now, more in a place of solidity and peace. But I think a lot of people take on these roles as parents, or husband or wife, and immediately think 'That's it. I'm grown up now. Done.'","In whichever way my music can get out there, I'm just like, 'Sure.' It's also through the TV synch licenses that I've been surviving. I don't really make money through record sales. I used to be really picky: 'No, I don't want it to be the song of a commercial,' but nowadays it's what you need to do to get the song out as much as you can.","With some artists, I've noticed that after their songs have been licensed, on their next album you can totally hear they're trying to write a song for 'Grey's Anatomy' and it doesn't work. It's just one of those things that has to feel genuine to last a long time.","And the thing about me is, I have a lot of mellow songs, because they're the easiest for me to write. I wanted to try to make some more upbeat songs, so, I ended up gravitating toward writing songs with friends, which was a great learning process, and also we came up with great songs. Those are the songs that came out the most naturally.","I wasn't sure if I wanted to put that out there so blatantly, so that before you listen to me you know that I'm Asian. But I thought it was sort of cool to embrace the Korean half of me, which I love.","I've written some happy songs but I can't ever play them in public because everybody will just start throwing up."],"Priscilla Chan":["We - the current generation - have a moral responsibility to make the world better for future generations.","We are all more capable than we could ever imagine or admit to.","Luck is not scalable. Luck is not a national strategy.","Mama showed me that I didn't have to change just because someone else saw things differently. She showed me that having differences is normal and that I didn't have to be afraid of the differences in all of us.","You - and I have to remind myself of this - are capable beyond your wildest imagination.","My public school teachers did a great job of saying, 'Check this out. You're qualified for this. You should explore these opportunities.' They're the ones who said, 'You know, apply to Harvard. You might be a good fit here.'","When I began my practice, I said I'm going to be a pediatrician that really thinks about and understands a child's educational trajectory.","We try to stick pretty close to what our goals are and what we believe and what we enjoy doing in life - just simple things.","My identity, I felt, was so distinct. I felt very much like an outsider. My family didn't have the same rituals that everyone else seemed to have.","Whatever you want to do, do it now.","I just think that philanthropy is a fancy way to say that you care about others and that you want to serve others. And that's been a part of me for as long as I can remember.","I am a simple creature.","I think it's a shame when people don't see the funny, thoughtful Mark that I know. He is incredibly sensitive and really cares about what other people need and want and really wants to be able to make someone else's day. And that's the Mark that I see.","I'm pro-hoodie.","We live in Palo Alto, which has, fortunately, one of the greatest school districts in the country.","We've invested in Newark's children, the schools and teachers, and these are long-term bets that need a number of years to really pan out. We've seen and learned how important it is to listen to the community and really get a sense of what they need and want. And it's a long journey.","I'd love a job at Facebook.","Education is an incredibly personal issue for me. If you're the first generation to go to college, sometimes you don't realize your potential until others point it out.","I bossed my middle sister around all the time.","We have Beast, our Hungarian sheep dog. And he is so talented. He's so smart. He knows his daily schedule. He has an extracurricular activity. He goes herding. He herds sheep. And we've been told that he's quite gifted.","We'll be investing in basic science research with the goal of curing disease.","Sharing our experience with pregnancy was incredibly important because we realized how challenging and difficult that was, and there are really dark moments where you think you're alone.","My parents believed in the power of education.","There are many philanthropists who we admire and have learned a great deal from, including mentors like Bill and Melinda Gates and peers like Cari Tuna and Dustin Moskovitz.","We hope that others will also commit to giving generously and starting young.","It takes a long time to get good at something, so it's important to begin as early as possible so that we can improve and begin to see the compounding benefits of the work over time.","If bad things happen to you as a kid, it's hard for you to succeed as an adult.","I actually had a lot of very smart peers.","Teach for America has helped us understand what works and what doesn't."],"Priscilla Presley":["As a person, he was wonderful. He really was a great person. He was full of life. He had a great sense of humor. Very talented, of course, but very caring to his parents. There was a very endearing quality about Elvis.","Inner beauty should be the most important part of improving one's self.","I lived a really wonderful life with this man and even after our divorce, it was incredible.","No one has really heard my side of the story, the adventure we had together, the transformation that I had going from a schoolgirl to a woman overnight.","And when Elvis was unhappy, believe me, everyone was unhappy.","Yes, the divorce was difficult. It was difficult.","It was more that his career was going down again and he was tired of the songs. He was tired of the routine. And there was a point where he just kind of gave up. He couldn't face being 40. And he resorted to stimulants. There's a dark side there, a really dark side.","I lived somebody else's life. It was never about me, it was really about him on every level.","I did, but I'm not real fond of giving interviews.","You have to remember that when I met Elvis, you know, it wasn't the fanfare that it is today or even when he was here in the states and I was in Germany growing up.","You know, I had my mother and my father convincing me that he would be going back to Hollywood and he'd be back with the actresses and dating them and that he wasn't serious about me at all. So I had him saying one thing to me and my parents telling me something else.","There were the phone calls and Elvis had asked me to visit him in Los Angeles. This was in 1962.","I mean, I had probably an illusion of being the wife that, you know, I wanted to create a home. I wanted to have children. I wanted him to be a husband. It was never going to be that way. It couldn't be that way.","She would go to Memphis and this was after our divorce. And I would send her to Memphis to be with him.","Absolutely. I - you know, he was so that much a part of my life that, you know, Elvis, you know, once - once you bonded with him, I mean, there was no - there was no going back. He was just a great guy.","You know, Lisa, for the longest time, did not sing.","You know, you know, obviously, if my daughter's happy, you know, then I don't have any problem.","It's not that, you know, when a relationship doesn't work and there are issues, you have to somehow work it out if there are children involved.","I don't feel like a grandmother. I don't.","At times he could be very critical. He didn't like prints on me. He didn't like stripes. He didn't like boldness. He said I was petite and that was taking away from my looks.","I just look at it, as it's something that I had to do. I had this vision that really, Graceland is suited for a king and it is his castle. And people really should see it, as he loved it.","He would use amphetamines to stay awake because he would have late night maneuvers that would go way into the early morning hours and he was given pills to stay up for the long hours.","There's been a big void out there, in terms of where I've been and what I am currently working on, I'd like to fill that void now and share my exciting plans for the future.","I like the creative aspect of developing a project.","There is a shyness about me, and I really need to get out more.","I don't want to be someone's entertainment.","You have so much to share, you have so much to tell, you have so much you want to expose, so much that's inside that you've learned from that life period. There are really very few people I can share that with."],"Pritam Chakraborty":["I don't have actors as friends. There's no actor who's my 3 A.M. friend. There are a couple of musicians whom I can call friends, and I have a close knit group of friends whom I feel comfortable with.","There was a time that I was only known for being a plagiarist. It used to hurt at times because there was so much effort I was putting into music. And instead of that, it was a couple tunes that I had reproduced from folk songs to remake as film songs, which were being written about.","I don't like talking unnecessarily, and my communication skills are zilch. I just can't converse with people. Maybe it's because of my stuttering or stammering, but I'm not confident of talking with people. I only talk to very close friends and family.","I was offered a few shows, but the money didn't work out, but I'm not very keen on judging such shows. I'm happy in my space as a composer.","I've seen composers work on 30 films at one go. So, eight or even 10 albums in a year is no big deal."],"Priya Sachdev":["India now has serious fashion consumers who do not think twice before splurging on an expensive luxury product.","I'm very superstitious, and I think it's bad luck. You don't have to show your love by tattooing it.","We have contributed through Indian culture; so many international collections are Indian-inspired. Why we don't make an international impact? We have talent, but we have not leveraged it, not married commerce to design.","The ballerina style is here to stay. An added advantage is that the shoes blend well with Indian as well as Western attire.","The socialite is becoming more important in a luxury brand's marketing strategy as she pulls in the 'right kind of crowd.'","TSG is competing with Middle East, East Asia and Europe in offering prices that are either lower or at par with these markets.","There is a lot of growth taking place in capturing aspirational consumers and converting them to luxury as they evolve.","Rentals are 10% of the sales of luxury brands globally, and we are able to achieve that in India by experimenting with location.","Women are more fashion conscious and are paying a lot of attention to what's happening globally.","When a celebrity is spotted carrying a particular bag, everybody wants to own the same thing.","There are some brands that we didn't expect to do well in India, like Alice + Olivia. But they sell like hot cakes because women here seem to love it.","Luxury cannot afford to intimidate.","You have to accommodate the rich and the new rich under the same roof."],"Priyanka Chopra":["I never thought I am a stylish. For me, style is always a representation of what you want to wear but doing it in a unique way and expressing yourself. Every girl loves to be stylish.","Any transition is easier if you believe in yourself and your talent.","Financial independence is paramount. My mom always says that when a woman is financially independent, she has the ability to live life on her own terms. I think that was the soundest advice that I ever got. No matter where you go in life or who you get married to, you have to be financially independent - whether you use it or not.","You can be an absolute woman and also be smart and tough and not lose your femininity.","Don't try to squeeze into a glass slipper. Instead, shatter the glass ceiling.","I don't think Bond does too much; he's just suave and sexy. He rolls out with his martini and fancy cars. Wow, it sounds like my life already.","I felt so out of place at the Miss India pageant. I had just come back from America, and I was told I needed to lose my American accent and learn the Queen's English, so I had to enunciate my vowels and speak well and eloquently. Giving up a New York accent is pretty hard.","I am a very private person. No one ever knows anything about me as I don't think it is necessary. I tell people as much as I want them to know about me.","It is in my nature to give the work I have all the discipline and due diligence that I am capable of.","I don't believe in being a size 0. I don't believe in starving. Women should totally embrace their curves.","I have great Indian genes! You know, I'm lazy. I want to take advantage of the fact that I have a great metabolism. When I start getting fat, I'll work on it! I like food, and I don't like the gym, and as long as I look like this without doing anything, why bother?","When I'm not shooting, I don't wear much makeup. I just moisturize and maybe put on a berry-colored balm on my lips and cheeks, and then mascara - that's it. My face and hair gets abused every single day, so I try take it easy on off days.","Art should not be bound by barriers or language. The Hindi film industry is a testament to that. We speak only Hindi, but we premiere in Germany and Japan. Our films do phenomenally well there. We transcend the barriers of language and culture. We welcome you in. I think that's what art should be, and I hope America reaches that place.","I've been used to being my own boss for a really long time, so I don't take to authority very well.","I wasn't the prettiest girl in the room, but I learned to carry myself with confidence - that's how you make the best impression on people.","To be a philanthropist, you don't have to be Nelson Mandela. You just have to look around you and ask, 'What little bit can I do? Whose life can I touch?'","I think art cannot be planned. The audience is too smart to get the dishonesty or 'too much planning' thing. I am not a legend, but I want to be one. I want to be known as an achiever. There is so much more that I can do.","I think there's a social responsibility that comes with a public platform. Because of the position that I've been put in, I think it's important to use my voice to do as much as I can.","I don't come from a film background. I haven't learned anything about films or film-making. But I have a thirst to know everything about my profession. I want to learn about cinematography, about editing, about music recordings, about post-production. So when people in the know talk, I willingly listen.","Guess girls are normally blonde, blue-eyed bombshells. It was nice to be a brunette one.","As a girl, I am this stupid, emotional, very loyal, sort of believe-in-values-and-principals sort of girl.","Black, brown, white, yellow - why are we always talking about colors? I'm a girl. I believe in a global community.","When I was little, my dad used to call me 'Bandarella,' because I was a mess - a Bandar is a monkey in Hindi. I was not a girly-girl and would always break something and would be running around and didn't really fit in.","When I grew up in America, I didn't see anyone who looked like me on TV. I feel overwhelmed with the things that people have said to me. When I meet Indian Americans who've lived here all their lives, it's overwhelming people holding me and crying. Someone said to me, 'Thank you for making us relevant.' It's such a big thing.","I was very sure I did not want to be the stereotype of what Indian people are seen as, which is Bollywood and henna. That's all great! It's what we are, and I love it. I love saris; I love music. I love henna; I love dancing, but that's not all we are.","I got into the movies by accident. When I got an offer, I thought, 'Let's try this, too.' Everything in my life has happened by trial and error. I didn't even think I would win the Miss India title, so where's the question of thinking I'd come this far.","I totally commit and completely give myself to a relationship. Be warned, though - I don't like being taken for granted, so I can be pretty high-maintenance sometimes!","I lost my dad two years ago to cancer, and before he died, I asked him to write 'Daddy's Little Girl' on a piece of paper for me. I told him it was for an album. He practiced and practiced and then sent it to me, and I had it tattooed onto my wrist and surprised him with it. He cried when he saw it, happy tears. This way I always carry him with me.","There are cliques in Bollywood, and people stick together, but I have always tried to stick to my work. As an industry, Bollywood is very competitive, and I'm very competitive as a person, but I've never been a part of any clique, and I've always worked with all actors and directors, all camps.","I don't like guys who are conventional. I'm an achiever; he has to be an achiever. I admire drive, I admire ambition. I like a guy who keeps my on my toes.","I am a little - I won't say arrogant - self-assured.","I'm trying to be global and trying to push us, as a society, to becoming colorblind, and so I'm very grateful to ABC for casting me in 'Quantico.' It was based on my merit, not on my ethnicity.","I like buying drones, hover boards, 360-degree cameras and fabulous cars. I am a little bit like a boy. I also spend a lot on books. I am a voracious reader, and I love vintage stores and first editions.","I think 'Baywatch' will be a summer blockbuster, and I'm not just saying it because I'm in it. I saw a bunch of scenes right now, and it's the funniest movie ever. Dwayne and Zac Efron have the best chemistry, and I come and interrupt their chemistry.","I'm really strict with my skincare regimen. No matter what's happening in my life, I wash my face every single night and I moisturize - even if it's 4 A.M.","Yes, I play this evil, mean character Victoria in 'Baywatch.' It is so much fun. I didn't want my first film in America to be just another role.","When I was 13, I would come visit my aunt and uncle in New York. I decided I wanted to live with them after seeing my cousin's school. Honestly, I just wanted to go to a school where I didn't have to wear uniforms, and my mom said okay.","I speak, Hindi, English, and American. I'm trilingual.","It's almost negligible sleep and insane amounts of plane rides, but I'm doing it. Your body is screaming out to you to not abuse it so much, but I love what I do in my Hindi films as well as with 'Quantico,' and I want to be able to balance both.","The writers are the backbone in television, like in film, but eventually, as an actress, I can bring something.","I live with romance in my brain. I'm a true-blue Cancerian like that.","My father is conservative but has always supported my decisions. He lets me take my own decisions. His only condition while allowing me to come to Mumbai was that my mother must accompany me.","I live cinema and passionately love music, and my efforts in both these crafts are unfolding.","Bollywood is not a stepping stone to the West. I am extremely picky and in no hurry to sign a Hollywood film. I am only greedy for great roles; language and country is no barrier. And yes, I'll always be a Hindi film star first.","When it comes to an everyday situation, I am like an ant. I keep putting money aside because I know that if I want to splurge, there is a big mountain of money that I can use.","After every bath, I make sure to moisturize my entire body. I'm obsessed with Diptyque: people love their candles, but their body products are also amazing.","You need to feel comfortable. When you're comfortable, you feel confident. And when you're confident, the world is your oyster. Most important, you gotta feel what you wear.","Education has always been very important to me. It means you don't have to depend on anyone else.","I can never be incognito... but I love it!","I hate the term 'Bollywood,' because we're not a 'me too' of Hollywood. The Indian film industry is prolific.","My favorite memory about 'Baywatch' is the music. That was my favorite part. It was, like, my calling. And to watch everyone run in slow motion.","Justin Timberlake - I'd like to learn a little more about his suit and tie.","When I became Miss World, I couldn't believe I had won it. I used to sleep with my crown because I was scared someone would steal it. In a minute, the world changed for me.","I think it's great to be flawed. I am hugely flawed, and I like it this way. That's the fun of life. You fall, get up, make mistakes, learn from them, be human and be you.","After I won Miss India, I realised I do not like failing. I just like being the best. I hate being a loser. So I just have to keep winning.","I think it was very important for me to look at starting to build a safety net so that I didn't feel the insecurity of the ups and downs of finances because I might do no film a year, or I might do six commercials, or I might do none.","You like someone, you court each other, you get into a relationship. You're answerable to each other. Whereas, the non-answerability of dating, my God, I don't know if I would ever be able to.","I taught myself confidence. When I'd walk into a room and feel scared to death, I'd tell myself, 'I'm not afraid of anybody.' And people believed me. You've got to teach yourself to take over the world.","I had a holding deal with ABC to find me a show, and I was very clear about the kind of show I wanted to do, because Indian people have always been seen as - well, we've been put in a box, about who we should be like.","My career is the sum of the decisions I have made. Everyone can work hard, but I work on my own terms. I stand my ground, and once I have committed to anything, I give my 150 per cent. I don't take my work for granted, ever. I know that, forget me, no matter where anyone is, everyone is dispensable. Why would I think I am indispensable then?","Generalizing a type of people is really primitive.","I adore watching movies; movie marathons are my favorite pastime. I can watch up to five movies back to back. I also love music and like reading whenever I get the time.","I believe destiny and hard work go hand in hand. I was studying to be an engineer when my mom and my brother sent my pictures for the Miss India contest. I didn't even know about it. If that isn't destiny, what is?","I have a very eclectic taste when it comes to music.","If two of your films don't do well, people say you're out in the cold and your career is over. One film does well, and you've had the best year of your life! I don't believe in all that's written.","As a musician, I know that it'll take time for me to get to the ranks of an established artiste. Nevertheless, I'm very happy that people are appreciating my music.","People keep speculating about my personal life because I am evasive about it.","I wasn't even prepared to be an actress. I was 17 when I came out of high school, and suddenly became Miss World and then I became an actress.","I like bad boys, and I like to take them home to my mom.","I love dabbling in different genres, and I like being good at different genres of cinema.","If my film does not do well, it really hurts me. But by God's grace, even if some of my films may not have done well, people have still liked my work in it.","My ambition when I was four years old was to be married.","I never had any awkward situations with Shah Rukh.","I owe 90 per cent of my life to people because I am a public figure, but 10 per cent is private to me. And I am not saying it in a defensive way. I feel my life has been made into a TV serial.","I was bullied by a freshman named Jeanine. She was black and supremely racist. Jeanine used to say, 'Brownie, go back to your country. You smell of curry,' or 'Do you smell curry coming?'","Stardom should be a discovery. You don't hammer it onto people's heads. You don't demand it. You command it.","I wanted to be cast because I'm an actor and not because of how I look or where I'm from. I'm brown. I want to be able to play a Spanish girl some day or a Mexican girl and learn the language. That's what actors do: we act.","When I was in school, you never saw anyone who looked like us that was on TV. And that was really weird for me because there's so many people of South Asian descent in America - in the world.","I'm not even Indian-American: I'm Indian-Indian. Everybody expected me to have henna and a nose pin and talk in an accent like Apu from 'The Simpsons.' I was nervous because I wasn't sure if America was ready for a lead that looked like me.","I have never had a plan when it comes to my career: America came to me with an opportunity.","In my 20s, I used to have a lot more energy! I was this skydiving, bungee-jumping adrenaline junkie. I don't know what happened to me! Now that I'm in my early 30s, I've put all that energy into my work, although I'm still a little ridiculous. In your 30s, you're sensible enough to know better, but still stupid enough to do stupid things.","When there is a ring on my finger, which is actually given to me, then I'll tell the world. Till then, no one can claim me.","To convince another part of the world that Bollywood is not just jokers who break into song and dance was very difficult. I'm literally ploughing the ground and making people understand that Indian actors are not a joke.","So many people from the West are coming into India, all the studios have come into India, and they're making films here, whether that's Fox, Warner Bros, Disney, everyone. That stands as testament for us, so why are we afraid of sharing our talent with the world? We must.","Art is collaboration: we are artists all over the world. I believe that people are always going to watch Hindi films... that's never going to die, but I think it's amazing that collaborations like that are happening.","Beauty and fashion are not really local anymore. You really have to be a global citizen to know what trends are. Now, it's pretty much the same designers and the same kind of trends, whether I am in New York, Milan, or Mumbai - it's the same.","In India, people love turmeric. They make turmeric milk, and sometimes I mix it with some cream or yogurt and turn it into a scrub. You'd be amazed at what it can take off your skin.","I've always had a glam squad to do my makeup because of Miss India and Miss World, so I never really learned much about doing it myself, unfortunately. I do try to pick up what I can, though! The most incredible product that has ever been discovered in makeup, according to me, is mascara.","I've never dated; I've always been in relationships.","I think because I was Miss World, and I modeled for a little while, I have - I just like heels, actually. I think that's the truth. I'm trying to find an excuse.","Who doesn't want to be, like, five inches taller whenever they can be? If boys could, they'd be wearing heels.","I always get stopped by security and immigration, telling me, 'Tell me who the terrorist is, or we won't stamp your passport!' The last time that somebody did that to me - at LAX, actually - I was like, 'Hey, don't ever ask a brown girl that in an American airport!'","Production is a lot of work. Nobody sent me that memo when they came to me to do television.","One girl used to call me Brownie and tell me to go back to my own country. At lunch, I'd get a bag of chips from the vending machine and eat it in the storage room so I wouldn't have to see her.","I think great skin is always important. With lots of makeup, by the end of the night, you look like you're melting!","America has been so welcoming to me.","I believe in myself and my art so much. I've always trusted destiny. Wherever it takes me, I just work damn hard at the opportunity.","I can't eradicate poverty, but at least for the people around me, I can help make sure no child is denied a dream.","The best part of working on 'Baywatch' is to be the villain of the movie. I don't think The Rock, aka Dwayne Johnson, has ever had anyone who's been mean to him.","As an entertainer, I try to do projects that reflect a woman having the ability to stand up for herself.","I've been doing a lot of work on female rights, especially adolescent rights. I've been to a lot of schools where the UNICEF had set up villages in India, and it's an eye-opening experience.","When I won Miss World, I wasn't even 18, and I only remember, like, I thought of it as a day in the races or something. It didn't feel like it was Miss World of the Millennium Year, the change of the century. I didn't understand the magnitude of it for at least a couple of years.","When I grew up, I never saw anyone looking like me on TV, you know? I'm so glad to see a lot more of us on television, whether it's Mindy Kaling or it's Irrfan Khan or Freida Pinto. You know, I hope, like, little girls across the world can just look at me and say, 'Ah, I want to be that!' Indian or not, it shouldn't matter.","I'm different. I don't speak perfect American. I do have a lilt of an Indian accent. I thought, 'Maybe the world's not okay with what I bring, being Indian.'"],"Protagoras":["Let us hold our discussion together in our own persons, making trial of the truth and of ourselves.","Man is the measure of all things.","There are two sides to every question.","As to gods, I have no way of knowing either that they exist or do not exist, or what they are like.","No intelligent man believes that anybody ever willingly errs or willingly does base and evil deeds; they are well aware that all who do base and evil things do them unwillingly.","The Athenians are right to accept advice from anyone, since it is incumbent on everyone to share in that sort of excellence, or else there can be no city at all."],"Prudentius":["Nothing is higher than the love of truth.","Hunger for gold is made greater as more gold is acquired.","To live is shared by all, but not to be worthy of living.","Bright light is injurious to those who see nothing."],"Pruitt Taylor Vince":["What's happened in my career is probably fate and good luck.","I think the bad-guy roles are fun - there are more of them, and they're written more colorfully.","I got agitated at the idea that racism is a Southern thing. Did you hear about the cross-burning out here? A black family moved into an upper-middle-class Los Angeles suburb and found a cross burning on their lawn. Swastikas are being painted on synagogues. I'm moving to France. I don't think this 'kinder, gentler nation' bit is working too well.","I never had a prejudiced bone in my body.","I didn't make movies when I was a kid, but I loved them. That was considered a far-fetched dream."],"Psy":["The world's most famous and popular language is music.","I try to dress classy and dance cheesy.","I'm not that good looking. That's why 'Gangnam Style' works. If someone handsome uses that phrase it's just awkward. But if someone like me uses it, it's funny.","As an artist, the more experience, the better the creation. I'm a very positive person.","Queen and Bon Jovi, Aerosmith and Guns N' Roses - I had a huge rock-band mania. I play a little bit of drums.","Everything moves way too fast.","I'm not that good looking.","While I'm grateful for the freedom to express one's self, I've learned there are limits to what language is appropriate and I'm deeply sorry for how these lyrics could be interpreted.","I need to show the world that my final goal is to perform huge concerts like Madonna.","Unexpectedly, I'm here now, so I need to let all the U.S. marketers know that Asians are not different. We are all the same.","If I say, 'Hey, I'm Psy.' 'Psy?' 'The guy from the video on YouTube?' 'Oh.' I hate that. I've got to be more popular than the video. So I need to keep promoting myself.","There's a lot of variety of musicians in Korea. I cannot say they are the best in the world, but I can say that Korean artists are really dynamic artists, so I am going to show that from now on.","We are just at the studio, me and my choreographers, we are spending like 30 nights and we are thinking, what is my next dance move? Because in Korea there are huge expectations about my dancing. So it was a lot of pressure.","My lifetime role model and hero is Freddie Mercury of Queen.","I never expect I would become a K-pop star.","My original name is Jae-Sang Park, so it's totally different.","I just made my album. I did my best. And I uploaded the video just to 'YouTube.' That was all.","Gangnam is a territory in Seoul, Korea. I describe it as noble at the daytime and going crazy at the night time. I compare ladies to the territory. So - noble at the daytime, going crazy at the night time - and the lyric says I am the right guy for the lady who is like that.","That's why 'Gangnam Style' works. If someone handsome uses that phrase it's just awkward. But if someone like me uses it, it's funny.","Before 'Gangnam Style' I was not a good attitude artist.","All the people in Korea are cheering me like I'm a gold medalist or something, so I have a responsibility to my country.","I understand the sacrifices American servicemen and women have made to protect freedom and democracy in my country and around the world.","The basic principle I have is that what is most Korean is what is the most international. I don't want to come here and act like I'm an American. I want to showcase the dynamic potential Korea has, and I want to prove that as an artist.","If a Korean artist reaches to the top, we're all ready to stand up and applaud for him or her.","To the U.S. and the world, I'm just known as some funny song and some funny music, some funny video guy. But in Korea I'm doing one of the biggest concerts; it's not a dance music concert. I'm playing with the band, so I change my every song to a rock song.","I cannot learn creation from other people; I've got to do it myself. Now, honestly, I regret not studying - I don't know about harmonies, or anything, so if I'm composing a song, it's really hard.","My lifetime role model and hero is Freddie Mercury of Queen. His songwriting skills, I cannot even approach, but his showmanship, I learned it from videos.","The fact that I'm shouting that I have Gangnam style makes people crack up. Imagine if Brad Pitt was singing the song - would it be funny? A twist is important when it comes to writing lyrics.","Thanks to many great K-pop singers, the groundwork has been laid for more Korean songs to be readily accessible to an overseas audience via channels like YouTube.","I've always tried to come up with funny dancing since I was young, to attract girls' attention for one thing. It's got to be funny. I can't pull it off with serious dances. That's not me.","I lived in the States from 1996 till 2000. I attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston in 1997. But I wasn't the most hard-working student. I rarely went to school. At that time, I seriously doubted that you could learn creativity in school. Music isn't something you can just learn from other people. Sometimes I regret missing classes.","In Korea, it's a tradition to inherit your father's business. Unfortunately, I'm the only son in the entire family, so they were forcing too much.","I've got to wear sunglasses everywhere, all the time, even if its indoors or at night time, to be recognized. That's part of my job. I cannot take off my sunglasses. For me, staying in the United States was so dark because I can't take them off.","When I signed with Scooter Braun and I decided to go overseas to promote my song, the only concern was how should I communicate with the public and the audience with my language. Scooter and I talked a lot about that: should we translate or not? Finally we didn't, and I think that was a really good decision.","It's tiring to be asked the same questions all day long: 'What is Gangnam style?' and 'Teach me how to dance.'","In Korean, my lyrics are witty and have twists. But translated into English, it doesn't come over. I've tried writing in English, just for me, but it doesn't work. I've got to know everything about a culture, and I don't.","I like the word 'artist,' but I don't like the word 'artist' inside my house.","My wife looks at the person Park Jae Sang and the singer who goes up on stage, Psy, as different people.","I really like the P!nk song with the guy from fun., 'Just Give Me a Reason.'","I was not familiar with the Internet thing. Honestly, you know with all kinds of Internet media, I was not that familiar. I was not that kind of guy. Accidentally, 'Gangnam Style' happened, and you have YouTube and all other sorts of stuff like Facebook and Twitter and so on. So after that, I learned and learned.","I will bring more Korean dance moves and Korean songs overseas."],"Publilius Syrus":["Good health and good sense are two of life's greatest blessings.","Anyone can hold the helm when the sea is calm.","Where there is unity there is always victory.","One is not exposed to danger who, even when in safety is always on their guard.","A good reputation is more valuable than money.","Fortune is like glass - the brighter the glitter, the more easily broken.","The person who receives the most favors is the one who knows how to return them.","You cannot put the same shoe on every foot.","If you wish to reach the highest, begin at the lowest.","From the errors of others, a wise man corrects his own.","Valor grows by daring, fear by holding back.","You can accomplish by kindness what you cannot by force.","Audacity augments courage; hesitation, fear.","Practice is the best of all instructors.","The happy man is not he who seems thus to others, but who seems thus to himself.","Let a fool hold his tongue and he will pass for a sage.","It is not every question that deserves an answer.","No one knows what he can do until he tries.","A hasty judgment is a first step to recantation.","It is a fraud to borrow what we are unable to pay.","Learn to see in another's calamity the ills which you should avoid.","I often regret that I have spoken; never that I have been silent.","Some remedies are worse than the disease.","Each day is the scholar of yesterday.","The bare recollection of anger kindles anger.","The opportunity is often lost by deliberating.","A beautiful face is a mute recommendation.","To do two things at once is to do neither.","He who lives in solitude may make his own laws.","We are born princes and the civilizing process makes us frogs.","The miser is as much in want of what he has as of what he has not.","How unhappy is he who cannot forgive himself.","Powerful indeed is the empire of habit.","Art has a double face, of expression and illusion, just like science has a double face: the reality of error and the phantom of truth.","The weeping of an heir is laughter in disguise.","It is a good thing to learn caution from the misfortunes of others.","Take care that no one hates you justly.","The wounds of love can only be healed by the one who made them.","Speech is the mirror of the soul.","It is kindness to immediately refuse what you intend to deny.","You are in a pitiable condition if you have to conceal what you wish to tell.","Do not despise the bottom rungs in the ascent to greatness.","What is left when honor is lost?","It is better to learn late than never.","It is only the ignorant who despise education.","It is a bad plan that admits of no modification.","It is folly to punish your neighbor by fire when you live next door.","A gift in season is a double favor to the needy.","An angry man is again angry with himself when he returns to reason.","To refuse graciously is to confer a favor.","When you confer a benefit on those worthy of it, you confer a favor on all.","The eyes are not responsible when the mind does the seeing.","Reprove your friends in secret, praise them openly.","Treat your friend as if he might become an enemy.","Count not him among your friends who will retail your privacies to the world.","He who spares the bad injures the good.","They do injury to the good who spares the bad.","The judge is found guilty when a criminal is acquitted.","Pain forces even the innocent to lie.","Admonish your friends privately, but praise them openly.","There are some remedies worse than the disease.","The remedy for wrongs is to forget them.","An angry father is most cruel towards himself.","We die as often as we lose a friend.","Prosperity makes friends, adversity tries them.","He whom many fear, has himself many to fear.","God looks at the clean hands, not the full ones.","He who has lost honor can lose nothing more.","Never promise more than you can perform.","While we stop to think, we often miss our opportunity.","The timid man calls himself cautious, the sordid man thrifty."],"Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus":["The courage of a soldier is heightened by his knowledge of his profession.","We find that the Romans owed the conquest of the world to no other cause than continual military training, exact observance of discipline in their camps, and unwearied cultivation of the other arts of war.","In time of peace prepare for war.","Let him who desires peace prepare for war.","A handful of men, inured to war, proceed to certain victory, while on the contrary, numerous armies of raw and undisciplined troops are but multitudes of men dragged to the slaughter.","Few men are born brave. Many become so through training and force of discipline.","Valor is superior to number."],"Pud Galvin":["From the time I went into baseball, I have always been handicapped by my hands, which are too small. I never saw the day yet when I was able to span an ordinary baseball.","My fingers are too short to enable me to get grip enough on the ball to pitch a deep curve, so that I have been compelled to depend more on drops, straight balls and the different artifices known to pitchers to deceive the batter."],"Punit Renjen":["When employees join executives in truly owning the responsibility for business success, an exciting new sense of teamwork takes hold.","An organization's culture of purpose answers the critical questions of who it is and why it exists. They have a culture of purpose beyond making a profit.","Millennials want to work for organizations that prioritize purpose as well as profit. It's as simple as that.","Skills-building opportunities should be extended to people outside of the mainstream talent pool. That might include at-risk youth, veterans returning to the workforce, or immigrants struggling to make a life for themselves in a foreign culture. The process for creating wealth must begin with creating opportunity for all.","For a firm to be exceptional, it has to be led by purpose. Our purpose is to make an impact that matters.","A strong sense of purpose drives businesses to take the long view and invest for growth.","For us as a firm, not only from a risk mitigation standpoint but also as a point of differentiation, it is incredibly important to get consistency and the very best individuals with the capabilities to do the very best job.","As a young boy growing up in Rohtak, India, I had no idea what my life's work would be. But my parents instilled in me something that I have never forgotten: that work must have a sense of purpose beyond mere financial gain; that to be meaningful, work should make a positive and lasting difference in the lives of others.","Technology is advancing at breakneck speed, upending old ways of doing business and resetting the social contract between employers and employees.","If corporations are to remain a legitimate instrument of collective action, they must concern themselves directly with the well-being of those party to, and affected by, their actions.","It is no longer enough to have a good product. A company's purpose and the way it treats its employees and the global community to which it belongs is also of great importance.","Fresh out of grad school, I arrived for my first day of work at Deloitte ready for the long haul. For my generation, that's what those early years were about - laying the foundation for a lifelong career with a great organization. More than 30 years later, I'm still with Deloitte, and I have no regrets.","Most millennials have no problem standing their ground when asked to do something that conflicts with their personal values.","The profound lack of economic opportunity for those left behind by globalization has created an ever-widening gap between the 'haves' and the 'have nots.'","Are businesses really benefitting if their communities are suffering? It doesn't seem like it.","As a society, we need to refocus on creating an economy that works for everyone. I believe the business community is in the best position to lead the way.","Exceptional businesses sustain bottom-line results, which they invest to create meaningful, positive impact for their stakeholders.","As business leaders, we should not choose between profit or good; rather, we must choose to profit from good. And that requires connecting what we do with a purpose beyond profit - a reason to exist that meets our shared sense of 'doing good.'","All the good work in the world will not compensate for the damage that a single facet of the business, or a rogue individual, can do. Insider trading, environmental damage, human-rights violations, and opportunistic practices erode trust and result in net negative impact.","Rethinking product supply chains offers another opportunity for traditional enterprises to introduce a host of positive outcomes.","In exceptional boardrooms, the intellectual rigor generated by a challenging question is both an accepted norm and a precursor to reaching informed decisions. This is the crucial edge that sets apart boards that lead from boards that follow.","I grew up in India. From my childhood, I remember the great reverence that people held for our national hero, Mahatma Gandhi. He galvanized millions to march as one, disarmed the empire that had ruled his country for nearly a century, and enabled India to become a free and independent nation.","Gandhi held no formal position of authority. Nor was there an organized army standing behind him. What he did have were his core beliefs and the audacity to speak truth to power.","Creative tension is constructive. Its purpose is to bring out the very best in management so that senior executives can generate the greatest value for shareholders, stakeholders, and society at large.","While they believe the pursuit of profit is important to sustaining a business, millennials also say that pursuit must be accompanied by a sense of purpose, by efforts to create innovative products or services, and, above all, by consideration of individuals as employees and members of society.","For millennials, conducting business with a purpose that goes beyond making profits is critically important in determining the kind of company they want to work for - and the kind of company with whom they are willing to do business.","The more a business is able to develop and articulate a core purpose and engage with millennials, who equate purpose with business excellence, the greater chances for long-term success.","Exceptional firms have always been good at aligning their mission or purpose with their execution and, as a result, have enjoyed category leadership in sales and profits.","I had this scholarship, two pairs of tight jeans, and a couple of hundred extra dollars, and I showed up in Oregon and went to school there.","While I was in school, a local magazine picked the 10 best students, and they picked me and profiled me in the magazine.","I'm good at what I do. I'm really, really good at what I do, and I'm not saying this with any level of arrogance.","For acquiring companies, the excitement is almost always about where they are going - that is, their strategy for gaining greater growth and productivity. But when mergers fail, it's often because no one focused on who they are - that is, their culture, which is critical to successfully bringing different groups of people together.","Many businesses find their culture organized around a dangerous fault line known as 'us and them,' with executives on one side and employees on the other. The divide is both real and expensive.","Defining, embedding, and living core beliefs set the stage for executives and employees to connect. Through actions that consistently convey who we are and how we act, executives can inspire employees to believe in the organization's values and buy in to its brand.","I have put in more than 10,000 hours perfecting my craft. And I am good at it.","It is harder to get into Deloitte than into the University of Pennsylvania.","I wish I was a great cricket player, but I am not.","Success in M&As comes with executing with vigour along with the obvious right choices that you got to make.","As I progressed in the firm, I learnt the craft, and as I learnt my craft, my partners and the firm threw up different opportunities.","As long as we deliver services with the highest level of quality and integrity, I'm happy.","For any young people looking for job opportunities, good grades and academic results are important, but what is more important may be showing you are someone who has the drive and capability and can fit in the company culture.","We want all clients to think of us first when they want to hire an auditor or if they want to have an adviser to solve difficult corporate problems. We want the best talent to join our firm.","Diversity is not just the right thing to do but right for business.","What I would say is that if someone faces discrimination, they should never back down. They should be self-confident and educate others not to have such an attitude.","Absolutely, at a macro-level, I want our firm to be a purpose-led firm. This notion of making an impact that matters, I want that embedded in whatever we do.","In order to generate extraordinary profits, you must have a focus that is beyond profits. You need to focus on how you serve your clients.","We believe that if you want to have diverse leaders 10 years down the road, we've got to make sure they're getting the right assignments, the right client experiences today.","When you talk about being exceptional, you do two things: You clearly answer the question 'Who are you?' which is your purpose. And you answer the second question, 'Where are you going?' which is your aspiration and how you're going to get there.","I want to be a purpose-driven, purpose-led organization, and I want the organization to achieve this aspiration of being the undisputed leader in professional services.","Our goal is not to be the biggest. Our goal is to be the best. That is why the aspiration that I have picked is to be the undisputed leader in professional services, and I'm starting with intangible metrics.","I'm not motivated by having the largest revenue base - you get that as an outcome. If we do our job well, we will be appropriately rewarded.","Leaders who understand the importance of the intangible elements contributing to workplace culture become sensitive to what makes their organization truly special. That is how they define core values and beliefs that are unique, simple, leader-led, repetitive, and embedded - transforming themselves from good to exceptional.","Leadership changes, and evolving marketplace conditions can significantly impact business strategy.","We are an organization led by a purpose - to make a positive, meaningful impact that matters to everyone Deloitte touches. I will do my best to serve the network by helping enable our leaders and people to fulfill their passion to make a difference.","It is a privilege to be part of an organization that delivers high-quality services and innovative solutions to the best clients, develops the most talented professionals into leaders, and does its part to improve the societies in which we operate."],"Pusha T":["A good villain exudes charisma and power. He has principles, though; that just gives him a level of dimension. It makes him seem to be a bit unpredictable, because he's usually deemed as some type of evil, ruthless person, and then he shows you his principles, and you don't know what to think of it.","More than anything, Play Cloths has taken risks in regards to the pieces of clothing that we're even creating. We started out as straight T-shirts. It was just T-shirts and a couple cool things. Now, it's leisure pants, it's all types of clothing. We're evolving even with fashion trends on a super high level.","I think about nothing but business the whole time. Even when I go out to my after-parties, people are like, 'You're drinking water?' I'm like, 'Yeah I am.'","I see people doing things in their Blackberrys, and I need paper. Lines. Alphabets. I need to see it. It's so elementary, man.","I feel like my lyrics are just dark and scathing. I feel like the lyrics on 'Darkest Before Dawn' are uncompromised hip-hop and really speaking to my core fan base. Basically what's been known in my discography the entire time.","I felt like when I got with Kanye, and we discussed me being on G.O.O.D. Music, he just really took me to a place in regards to music that I love and music that I had made previously. We had a clear understanding of what I wanted to make, and he just seemed like he was an advocate for hardcore, uncompromising hip-hop.","I feel like I'm the last rap superhero. I really do. I feel like everybody else, they seem to be a bit victimized, and I don't feel like that's me.","I just look at capitalizing on everything that I feel like G.O.O.D. Music brings to the music industry, our following, and the culture. First of all, we have incredible artists. It's definitely about getting those albums out in a very manicured fashion.","I got two stores, two streetwear stores, at home. Have to tend to those. Play Cloths. Have to tend to that business.","I just start my day really early. Everything happens in the morning time. Writing. Just everything. I can't - I don't know how to work late.","I had a really successful 2013, '14, '15. Touring, just doing my thing. Super - I mean, can't complain about nothing. And my road manager got killed. And it ruined everything. Now, I tell people - I don't know if this is a word. But I tell people that that re-sensitized me.","My mood board says that there should be a G.O.O.D. Music festival. Why not? Like, we haven't - I don't think - and I think all of the G.O.O.D. Music artists and affiliates are doing so many different things that we never get to Voltron up. So that would be a thing of mine.","Allen Iverson is, like, my all-time hero.","Playing a room, it's a real dictator-type situation - you can really move the crowd the way you want to. In a festival, there's a sea of people, and it's harder to lock in on any one group.","I've got my travelling, my packing, my after-show activities all down to a science. I used to not work out on tour; now I take a trainer with me. I do things to make sure that I can give the crowd my all, because that's what I'm all about.","I caught the U.S. Open a couple of times, but, man, I would love to catch Wimbledon and watch Nadal - he is the king of all kings.","I've never been - I don't think I'm, like, a great A&R by any means. I don't even know production lingo, in all honesty.","I try to do records sometimes that have a different bounce - maybe it's a Southern bounce or something.","I never understood why movies don't have to be as responsible, or the responsibility stops with Rated R. I feel like music, you gotta - you put the sticker on it, you make the clean version, then you're explaining yourself, and then you have to do charities to offset what you just said. No one else has to do this!","Me tweeting sometimes, it's like, I don't even remember what I say. It's just coming off how it's coming off.","When you make albums like I do, and it's based off fanfare and based off touring - I make these albums, and I get on the road. It's not really a radio-driven thing. I get on the road, and I see my fans, and I touch each and every last one of them.","My fans like a certain quality and a certain level of music. Once I give it to them, they seem pretty happy.","I feel like, as far as streetwear goes, man, Play Cloths sits at a top-tier of quality, and your idea of luxury should not stop where you feel like you're at the obvious.","Pharrell has definitely influenced my style in regards to streetwear. Simply because we're from that era that Nigo and A Bathing Ape started. That's where it all started at for us.","Virginia Beach is just such a melting pot for so many different things, and they just have so many influences. I would always say that the area definitely influences Play Cloths. The area itself just has so many influences, whether it be fashion, music, everything.","Biggie is my favorite rapper, for sure. No other artist has impacted me that much.","'Darkest Before Dawn,' the short film, is basically the film of a man who faces the darkness when his back is against the wall and just about how miracles come in all forms, and even in your darkest times, it comes.","My vision for G.O.O.D. Music is just carrying on with the tradition of putting out high-quality music, high-quality art. G.O.O.D. Music is entrenched in the culture of hip-hop. It's entrenched in the culture, period.","Oh, I'm up at 6:00 A.M. every morning because I have a lot to do. Plenty. I work out probably at, like, 8:00. I gotta eat at 6:00 so, therefore, I can workout at 8:00.","I've always had some level of having to be independent outside of music because the music wasn't a smooth ride. We lost a lot in the mix: Everybody that I came in the music game with - friends I brought in with me - are all doing 10-34 years in jail. That's why if you want to get the real, you gotta get it from me.","As a writer, you're always trying to say the best thing. You're always thinking about what's the best thing to say, and what's the hardest way to say it, and what's the best line? Sometimes the best line is the simplest line. Sometimes the best line is the line that evokes more feeling than actual wordsmithing.","I make a timeless music. I think I've made my mark as a lyricist and as an innovator and as a tastemaker.","My music is airy; it's spacious. It requires you to be able to rap and articulate your message over it. That's what the beat demands of you. Not a lot of people try to rap over my beats because it's a bit of a task.","The crafting of lyrics is really a task, and when it comes to street culture, I don't feel like anyone else articulates it better than me.","By now, you should know what you're getting with Pusha T. I've been in this game since 2002, and my name says it all. You know I'm only moved by a certain style of rap. Not that many other styles move me. You have to really be a rapper's rapper for me to like it.","The Re-Up Gang mixtapes are going down in history, man. I still listen to them in my car, and the 'Hell Hath No Fury' album. I tell people all the time that I'll never make another album like that one again. Never!","When we were growing up, I got kicked out of Timbaland's house every day. He was the DJ for my brother's rap group in junior high school. So I was 7, and while Tim's DJ'ing and my brother's rapping, I'd be upstairs dancing.","I tell people that the Clipse were the first Internet rap darlings.","I don't even know how to think about running out of things to talk about. Certain things are inescapable to me. I'm connected by the hip with so many things in the streets.","G.O.O.D. Music is on top because G.O.O.D. Music is the culture. When you think of, you know, just every aspect from music, influence, fashion, art level. If it's not G.O.O.D Music, then it's somebody who was influenced heavily by G.O.O.D. Music.","I've been going to Europe for some time on the festival circuit, and once you get in that element and see others reacting to it, it's easier to understand. You get trapped in the wave. The beats are driving and super-aggressive - like, so hard. I was curious.","My hip-hop fans are a little spoiled - they want a particular level of lyricism and energy that I'm known for. When they don't get that, it takes a little time for them to open up to it. But electronic fans are as free as the music. On social media, they were so excited and loud; they're in awe.","Some of the greatest hip-hop artists have incorporated elements from electronic shows into their setup. People are taking notice. It's going to be a new wave.","People don't understand how long it really takes to find beats. Sometimes they're not all the way there, but it's elements in them I love. Then I get to take them to get chopped up. Ye got to cook over a few of them.","I think adidas really understands that it's cool to be in business with the right people. It really feels like a bunch of creative minds rather than some rap guys stamping their names on a sneaker. We're arguing over shoes, ideas, and everything - it's like a tug of war."],"Pyotr Aven":["Any structure that is part of Alfa Group, whether the Alfa Eco commodities trader or the Perekryostok supermarket chain, is treated by bank officers as an ordinary client without special privileges.","From the very beginning, our goal has been to establish a normal company in the Western sense.","We have a lot of people with a Western education who work in Russia and understand the international rules of business and corporate governance.","I do not believe in conspiracy theories.","The so-called oligarchs have always had less influence than conventional wisdom attributed to them.","Those who were closest to Yeltsin behaved as if they were running the government.","Why, instead of bringing order - planting a tree, building a house, washing socks or reading a fairytale to a child - does one need to engage in doing nothing, then after a good booze, taking up a club and smashing everything?"],"Pythagoras":["Silence is better than unmeaning words.","Choose rather to be strong of soul than strong of body.","There is geometry in the humming of the strings, there is music in the spacing of the spheres.","Friends are as companions on a journey, who ought to aid each other to persevere in the road to a happier life.","As long as man continues to be the ruthless destroyer of lower living beings he will never know health or peace.

No man is free who cannot control himself.","There is a good principle which created order, light, and man, and an evil principle which created chaos, darkness, and woman.","It is better wither to be silent, or to say things of more value than silence. Sooner throw a pearl at hazard than an idle or useless word; and do not say a little in many words, but a great deal in a few.","Virtue is harmony.","Reason is immortal, all else mortal.","Above the cloud with its shadow is the star with its light. Above all things reverence thyself.","No one is free who has not obtained the empire of himself.","Rest satisfied with doing well, and leave others to talk of you as they will.","The oldest, shortest words - 'yes' and 'no' - are those which require the most thought.","Do not say a little in many words but a great deal in a few.","Anger begins with folly, and ends with repentance.","A thought is an idea in transit.","Beans have a soul.","Do not talk a little on many subjects, but much on a few.","As soon as laws are necessary for men, they are no longer fit for freedom.","Strength of mind rests in sobriety; for this keeps your reason unclouded by passion.","There is nothing so easy but that it becomes difficult when you do it reluctantly.","Begin thus from the first act, and proceed; and, in conclusion, at the ill which thou hast done, be troubled, and rejoice for the good.","The most momentous thing in human life is the art of winning the soul to good or evil.","Above all things, reverence yourself."]}
