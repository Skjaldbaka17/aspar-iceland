{"F. E. Smith":["The world continues to offer glittering prizes to those who have stout hearts and sharp swords.","Good God, do you mean to say this place is a club?"],"F. Gary Gray":["Success is really about your mindset.","Creativity is a mansion. If you're empty in one room, all you have to do is go out into the hallway and enter another room that's full.","I take nothing away from my existence in the 'hood, because it sharpened my instincts. We had a different way of living that developed our survival instincts, and I use those to this day when I make films. You can't buy that.","'Straight Outta Compton' is my first biopic, my first period piece, and I got a chance to kind of get out there like some of my idols, you know, like Scorsese, Spielberg, Spike Lee, the guys who came before me. You know, I'm feeling good about it.","I don't have a typical filmmaker background. I didn't grow up with a super eight camera or a video camera. I didn't start cutting movies when I was four or five.","I actually didn't really start to get into the research of film until I was much older. I decided I wanted to direct a lot earlier than I started to do the research, which is really strange, but it is the case.","I remember where I was when I first heard 'Boyz N The Hood' - 126th Street and Normandy, South Central, Los Angeles. I remember that I was on my porch. What they described in that song was so vivid and so clear to me because it was the kind of life I was used to witnessing and partly experiencing in my neighborhood.","I knew that in Hollywood they tend to pigeonhole talent, and when you experience a little success in one genre, their instinct is to keep you in that box.","I was a little hesitant at first because there's so many ways you can get 'Straight Outta Compton' wrong. You know, it's such a great story; it's such a classic tale. I was a little nervous 'cause it's like a very narrow road to success with that type of story - you got to get it right - but when I read it, I was pleasantly surprised.","I love a challenge. So when I did 'Friday,' I didn't want to do another comedy back-to-back. With 'Set It Off,' that was a little different from 'The Negotiator' and 'The Italian Job.' So for me, it's all about challenge. It's all about challenge and about just learning.","Everybody comes to film differently; everybody has different backgrounds. Just find whatever your lane is naturally. Don't try to force yourself into someone else's vision or try to tell a story that you're not passionate about.","My parents separated when I was 2, and my dad always lived in Chicago and my mother in L.A. I'd go back and forth and sometimes spend the summer with my dad, but L.A. was home.","I was doing well in TV as a freelance cameraman, but it wasn't the direction I wanted to go in. I directed videos and tried to put something cinematic in every one. Dialogue, action sequences, helicopter, Steadicam.","You have to enjoy yourself when you go to the movies. People don't want to spend their hard earned money to simply go see a history lesson.","Hip hop has been an integral part of my life and my whole career. I started off doing videos with Ice Cube and Dre and Mary J. Blige and TLC.","We didn't have much money growing up, so we hopped around L.A. a lot in the '70s, '80s and '90s. I'm very familiar with the shifting culture there.","If I were to do a movie about Apollo 13, I'd be at NASA studying what it took to go into space. It's part of your job to go deep, to interview the right people.","When you start directing movies at the age of 24, you're just a kid; you don't necessarily even have the experiences to add to the story. You're working off of instinct and raw emotions and raw talent, and hopefully it's the same trajectory as growing as a person.","I always direct next to the camera and watch my actors, and so you can see the small things that you can't see on the small screen but you can definitely see on the big screen.","When you look at someone good like J.J. Abrams who gives you the spectacle and great action set pieces but also gives you character and great story and plotting and narrative, I think it's my job - and my intention - to do both.","I never limit myself when it comes to telling stories; I think people can see that in my body of work. It's just about, 'What's a great story? Is it unique? Is it a challenge?'","No matter where you came from, you can be inspired.","Most of music videos were short films - they had dialogue, action sequences. I shot with cranes and helicopters. I wanted to created cinema-like moments.","I taught a master class in film in France, and that was a great experience because I got a chance to study the French film culture and the French film history, so to add... just to expand myself just personally and professionally was really helpful.","What do I bring to a film? I think, maybe, I know for a fact that I focus on connection of character; I focus on warmth and a heart, but I don't know if it's because I'm African American or because I'm crazy -who knows.","Why did I want to become a director? I just had an early interest. My uncle was an actor in a local community theatre, and he ultimately persuaded me and a buddy of mine to come to that theatre, and we went to meet girls, and that turned into interested in kind of behind-the-scenes things, and from that point on, I was focused.","I'm single-minded. When I'm working on a project, all my attention is there.","I know a lot of people who enjoy rap music who aren't black. You can't just say it's black music. To segregate films the way Hollywood likes to segregate films, ultimately everyone loses.","I'm not afraid of a big studio film; I trust my instincts. But for me, it's not really about box office. It's about looking back on your work and not having to apologize for it."],"F. H. Bradley":["There are those who so dislike the nude that they find something indecent in the naked truth.","The secret of happiness is to admire without desiring. And that is not happiness.","The force of the blow depends on the resistance. It is sometimes better not to struggle against temptation. Either fly or yield at once.","The world is the best of all possible worlds, and everything in it is a necessary evil.","The one self-knowledge worth having is to know one's own mind.","We say that a girl with her doll anticipates the mother. It is more true, perhaps, that most mothers are still but children with playthings.","The man who has ceased to fear has ceased to care.","One said of suicide, As long as one has brains one should not blow them out. And another answered, But when one has ceased to have them, too often one cannot.","The deadliest foe to virtue would be complete self-knowledge.","Our live experiences, fixed in aphorisms, stiffen into cold epigrams. Our heart's blood, as we write it, turns to mere dull ink.","There are persons who, when they cease to shock us, cease to interest us.","Another occupation might have been better.","It is good to know what a man is, and also what the world takes him for. But you do not understand him until you have learnt how he understands himself.","The mood in which my book was conceived and executed, was in fact to some extent a passing one.","Metaphysics is the finding of bad reasons for what we believe upon instinct; but to find these reasons is no less an instinct.","It is by a wise economy of nature that those who suffer without change, and whom no one can help, become uninteresting. Yet so it may happen that those who need sympathy the most often attract it the least.","Eclecticism - every truth is so true that any truth must be false.","Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived. It is a pity that this is still the only knowledge of their wives at which some men seem to arrive.","True penitence condemns to silence. What a man is ready to recall he would be willing to repeat."],"F. L. Lucas":["The most emphatic place in a clause or sentence is the end. This is the climax; and, during the momentary pause that follows, that last word continues, as it were, to reverberate in the reader's mind. It has, in fact, the last word.","A man can make himself put down what comes, even if it seems nauseating nonsense; tomorrow some of it may not seem wholly nonsense at all.","And how is clarity to be achieved? Mainly by taking trouble and by writing to serve people rather than to impress them.","The only hope I can see for the future depends on a wiser and braver use of the reason, not a panic flight from it.","Apart from a few simple principles, the sound and rhythm of English prose seem to me matters where both writers and readers should trust not so much to rules as to their ears.","At Munich we sold the Czechs for a few months grace, but the disgrace will last as long as history.","Most style is not honest enough.","Poetry had far better imply things than preach them directly... in the open pulpit her voice grows hoarse and fails.","The two World Wars came in part, like much modern literature and art, because men, whose nature is to tire of everything in turn... tired of common sense and civilization."],"F. Lee Bailey":["Can any of you seriously say the Bill of Rights could get through Congress today? It wouldn't even get out of committee.","I would strongly recommend any young man to stay away from criminal law. It's not a good place to be, unfortunately.","I use the rules to frustrate the law. But I didn't set up the ground rules.","I enjoy personal injury cases. I've tried quite a few of those. And, frankly, any kind of litigation that is trouble-shooting, whether it's equities, suits and injunctions, or whatever.","Justice Scalia is predictable. He can be counted on to come down with a conservative opinion, and generally, to bring Justice Clarence Thomas with him.","Among the rednecks of America, which there are many more than people seem to realize, it was terribly damaging. I got blamed for O.J.'s acquittal.","I can get a firestorm going anywhere in the United States by saying 'O.J.'","There are no major cities I haven't been in - at least once. I'd be just as happy not to go out of town for a couple of months and play with toys.","If I'm offered a good case in Florida or a good case somewhere else, South Florida will win every time."],"F. Murray Abraham":["I'm just having a wonderful time. It's an interesting thing that I'm very comfortable with this material and I don't know why. Maybe it's because I did MacBeth.","I think creativity is spiritual. I absolutely believe that.","I love parties. I love a good time.","All the stuff that you visualized that was going to work so beautifully, you discover is trashed, so you jump to something else.","The difficulty is capturing surprise on film.","People desire power. I don't know why they want it so. It seems to me it implies a hugely superior intellect which separates them from most of the populace.","I'm not going to just say nice things about everybody unless I mean it.","Woody Allen sets are very quiet. Extraordinary sense of power from a man who doesn't do anything except just stand there.","I really like to experiment. That's the only way I can work. It's instinctive.","I just throw it out and see what happens. If it sounds and feels right, then I continue.","There are certain men and women who, from the minute they step in front of a camera, that's exactly where they belong. Connery's one.","Arnold Schwarzenegger, I don't know if you'd call him a great actor, but he's amazing in terms of his presence, and he is interesting enough that you want to watch him.","With Connery, he does act. He is in complete command. He completely trusts the person first, then the instrument. I've worked with his son also, on a picture in Russia.","There is one confrontation scene toward the end of the picture. In the middle of the scene, I thought, That's Sean Connery! I don't know how else to describe Sean Connery. I still feel that way.","I'd like President Bush to think maybe there's another way to think, that maybe Kissinger was wrong when he says we had to go in there because he was wrong about Vietnam.","If these men decided that they have to go in there and fight, I want them to send their own children and grandchildren. I want them to not send a bunch of strangers' kids in there to fight and die.","I'd like President Bush to get a gun in his hands. I'll go with him. I can't think of anything better than to die in place 's just beginning their lives.","I trust that the president will try, just give it one more shot, some revolutionary way of not doing this, of bringing all those kids back home safely.","The idea that you can make love and not war really is pretty neat. That thing in Korea, the thing in Israel - that's all over the world. There must be a new way of thinking.","I have two brothers buried in the military cemetery in Texas. I don't want to see any more of that.","I don't want to talk in terms of miracles. I think this is a very serious situation. But I do want to talk in terms of Bush becoming a man of the hour, and I think this is way to do it.","I acted my heart out.","Milos said, You're my first choice. From my point of view, that doesn't pay the rent. I said, Tell me what I have to do next because I'm busy painting my kitchen.","Suddenly I was the man who got the part that every actor in the English language was trying to get. I was really scared. I had talked the talk, and now I had to walk the walk. For three days, I couldn't answer the phone.","As much preparation as I had made for the old man Salieri, gestures and so on, the fact is after sitting for hours, your movements are kind of slow.","Once I looked into a mirror at my face I felt like it was completely convincing. I was Salieri.","I'm a very proud actor.","With Dick Smith there, and the words of Peter Shaffer... they've got to be the most beautiful descriptions in music ever written on film or in literature. And we could hear the music accompanying the words... What more can you ask for?","Whenever there were parties, I wasn't invited because I began to be like that character. In a way, that contributed to the success of the performance.","I can't pretend at how much I object to all of the plays that keep being brought back over and over again, the so-called classic plays. I mean how many times can we see 'The Glass Menagerie?'","I worked with Harold Pinter once as my first Broadway show. It was one of the most exciting things that ever happened to me.","I'm the spokesperson for the Multifaith Alliance for Syrian Refugees. My father was from Syria. It's an American initiative, and it's multi-faith. So, it's maybe 60-65 different organisations, Jews, Christians, Hindus... Anyway, it's very important and serious.","I always play these bad guys, and I'm really a nice guy.","I'm first-generation American - my people came over on boats - and I think it's a shame to close the door on people who really need freedom.","One of the great values of the theater is a communal search for truth; I believe that sincerely.","I cannot imagine not working. I don't understand the word 'retirement.'","My Oscar has appeared in every play I've done since - not in view of the audience, but for my colleagues to enjoy.","No matter all of your credits and accomplishments - you can be forgotten in a trice. The idea that you have to go back and start again after considerable success can destroy you if you're not strong. I never lost track of who I am and what I can do, because I continually find things to do, but not everyone has that resource.","I'm not afraid to go anywhere, to the smallest theatre or the least amount of money.","There are real tricks to getting a job that I just don't like or understand - it feels too close to pandering. I've tried it, but it doesn't work.","It sounds funny, but I felt that my responsibility as an American actor was to let the British know we can act as well as they can.","The only reason I signed on for a speech and drama course was because I thought it would be easy, but as soon as I stepped on the stage, I thought, 'This is exactly where I belong.'","After I finished school, I headed for Los Angeles, thinking, 'Movies. Beaches.' But I wanted to do serious stage work, so I upped sticks and moved to New York to study. I did the usual day jobs to support myself - waiting on tables, washing dishes, parking cars, anything to pay the rent. I was a terrible waiter, by the way.","I'm a comedian at heart, and I really can make people laugh, but ever since 'Amadeus,' all I seem to do is play dramatic roles and villains.","My family is blue-collar - coal miners and steelworkers. My father was an automobile mechanic, and us boys were brought up to work. I used to pump gasoline at 11 cents a gallon. I thought I would like to be a first-rate mechanic; a respected, hard-working man.","Marlon Brando was the major influence in my life, though I never met him. And my father - we didn't get along, but he was an influence in terms of honesty and work ethic. That's the greatest compliment I could pay him.","I like to teach. And when I spot talent without ambition, it makes me angry. I give students short shrift if they're not willing to do the work. Relying on talent is not enough.","I'm passionate about politics, but when it comes to political parties, I'm despondent. I'm disappointed at the absence of a sense of humanity and struggle to not become a cynic."],"F. Scott Fitzgerald":["Personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures.","The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.","All good writing is swimming under water and holding your breath.","Never confuse a single defeat with a final defeat.","First you take a drink, then the drink takes a drink, then the drink takes you.","Show me a hero and I'll write you a tragedy.","Life is essentially a cheat and its conditions are those of defeat; the redeeming things are not happiness and pleasure but the deeper satisfactions that come out of struggle.","You don't write because you want to say something, you write because you have something to say.","Vitality shows in not only the ability to persist but the ability to start over.","A great social success is a pretty girl who plays her cards as carefully as if she were plain.","What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon? And the day after that, and the next thirty years?","Genius is the ability to put into effect what is on your mind.","In a real dark night of the soul, it is always three o'clock in the morning, day after day.","I'm a romantic; a sentimental person thinks things will last, a romantic person hopes against hope that they won't.","Nothing is as obnoxious as other people's luck.","The world, as a rule, does not live on beaches and in country clubs.","It's not a slam at you when people are rude, it's a slam at the people they've met before.","Everybody's youth is a dream, a form of chemical madness.","Switzerland is a country where very few things begin, but many things end.","To write it, it took three months; to conceive it three minutes; to collect the data in it all my life.","Action is character.","I've been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.","To a profound pessimist about life, being in danger is not depressing.","My idea is always to reach my generation. The wise writer writes for the youth of his own generation, the critics of the next, and the schoolmasters of ever afterward.","Family quarrels are bitter things. They don't go according to any rules. They're not like aches or wounds, they're more like splits in the skin that won't heal because there's not enough material.","There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.","Riches have never fascinated me, unless combined with the greatest charm or distinction.","An author ought to write for the youth of his own generation, the critics of the next, and the schoolmaster of ever afterwards.","Cut out all these exclamation points. An exclamation point is like laughing at your own joke.","At eighteen our convictions are hills from which we look; at forty-five they are caves in which we hide.","There are no second acts in American lives.","It is in the thirties that we want friends. In the forties we know they won't save us any more than love did.","Great art is the contempt of a great man for small art.","Her body calculated to a millimeter to suggest a bud yet guarantee a flower.","Trouble has no necessary connection with discouragement. Discouragement has a germ of its own, as different from trouble as arthritis is different from a stiff joint.","Speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again.","It is sadder to find the past again and find it inadequate to the present than it is to have it elude you and remain forever a harmonious conception of memory.","I like people and I like them to like me, but I wear my heart where God put it, on the inside.","Men get to be a mixture of the charming mannerisms of the women they have known.","Either you think, or else others have to think for you and take power from you, pervert and discipline your natural tastes, civilize and sterilize you.","No such thing as a man willing to be honest - that would be like a blind man willing to see.","No grand idea was ever born in a conference, but a lot of foolish ideas have died there.","The idea that to make a man work you've got to hold gold in front of his eyes is a growth, not an axiom. We've done that for so long that we've forgotten there's any other way.","Often people display a curious respect for a man drunk, rather like the respect of simple races for the insane... There is something awe-inspiring in one who has lost all inhibitions.","The victor belongs to the spoils.","When people are taken out of their depths they lose their heads, no matter how charming a bluff they may put up.","The easiest way to get a reputation is to go outside the fold, shout around for a few years as a violent atheist or a dangerous radical, and then crawl back to the shelter.","For awhile after you quit Keats all other poetry seems to be only whistling or humming.","It occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well.","After all, life hasn't much to offer except youth, and I suppose for older people, the love of youth in others.","His was a great sin who first invented consciousness. Let us lose it for a few hours.","Only remember west of the Mississippi it's a little more look, see, act. A little less rationalize, comment, talk.","Forgotten is forgiven.","Some men have a necessity to be mean, as if they were exercising a faculty which they had to partially neglect since early childhood.","No decent career was ever founded on a public.","Scratch a Yale man with both hands and you'll be lucky to find a coast-guard. Usually you find nothing at all.","Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues.","Though the Jazz Age continued it became less and less an affair of youth. The sequel was like a children's party taken over by the elders.","The compensation of a very early success is a conviction that life is a romantic matter. In the best sense one stays young.","A big man has no time really to do anything but just sit and be big.","Genius goes around the world in its youth incessantly apologizing for having large feet. What wonder that later in life it should be inclined to raise those feet too swiftly to fools and bores.","The faces of most American women over thirty are relief maps of petulant and bewildered unhappiness.","Advertising is a racket, like the movies and the brokerage business. You cannot be honest without admitting that its constructive contribution to humanity is exactly minus zero.","You can stroke people with words."],"F. Sionil Jose":["When I wake up every morning, I thank God for the new day.","The influence of teachers extends beyond the classroom, well into the future. It is they who shape and enrich the minds of the young, who touch their hearts and souls. It is they who shape a nation's future.","Writers are historians, too. It is in literature that the greater truths about a people and their past are found.","Art, whatever form it takes, requires hard work, craftsmanship and creativity. As a writer, I know my grammar, cadence, the music of prose, and the art of the narrative.","Indeed, the existence of class, of social hierarchy, is as old as man himself. It prevails in the jungle where strength determines hierarchy; among men, it has also been savagely the same, whereby rulers vested with power through personal combat, or through lineal heritage as in the case of royalty, ravage their subjects.","The past could liberate or imprison - it creates a nation's character, provides the nourishment or the poison a people imbibe in their very marrow.","We are shallow because we have become enslaved by gross materialism, the glitter of gold and its equivalents, for which reason we think that only the material goods of this earth can satisfy us and we must therefore grab as much as can while we are able.","Of course, we are all egoists. Egoism is so much a part of our humanity.","Industrialization starts with the formation of capital - it does not matter how. It can be created by saving, by the state enforcing its will on the people, by the very rich themselves.","November is auspicious in so many parts of the country: the rice harvest is already in, the weather starts to cool, and the festive glow which precedes Christmas has began to brighten the landscape.","All dictators, the rich and famous, to the lowest security guard who holds a gun, easily forget that power is transitory.","I can't understand Urdu, Bahasa or Russian, but when the Pakistani Faiz, the Indonesian Rendra and the Russian Rosdentvensky declaim, I can feel the living throb of rhythm and music, the warmth and passion of their poetry, as do the hundreds, not a mere roomful, of poetry lovers in the audience.","Cultural values are, in themselves, neutral as well as universal, and so much depends on how individuals or ethnic groups use them. Values are influenced by so many factors such as geography, climate, religion, the economy and technology.","The literary depiction of life and its moral dilemmas compel us to use our conscience, to make those infallible distinctions between right and wrong.","In the end, religion teaches us to value truth, justice and freedom.","In the visual arts, particularly painting, I distrust all those abstractions, those artificial constructions. I have a very simple way of judging them: if I can do them, they are not art.","I envy those Hindus and Buddhists who have in their religion philosophy and ancestor worship which build in the believer a continuity with the past, and that most important ingredient in the building of a nation - memory.","Language as a communication tool is the primary element from which literature is created. Even in pre-literate societies, it exists as songs, riddles, or epics that are chanted.","This is the harsh truth about us: not only do Filipinos ignore books, literature - we do not understand how important the arts are - not just to those of us who work at it, but to the nation as a whole.","We must know our own roles. We should also know the roles that others play, and the rules such roles follow. In this manner, social harmony is maintained. It is when we overstep our roles, or act without knowing them, that social anarchy ensues.","You should live in a manner that should enable you to devote time to writing and contemplation. As is often said, the writer is at work even when he is simply looking out the window.","I find it always pleasurable talking with young people, particularly those aspiring to be writers, out of nostalgia, and because I've always felt that we oldies can learn so much from them and draw from them inspiration in our flagging and rickety years.","A weak people and its equally debilitated leaders are bludgeoned by history. It maims them into the cripples that they are meant to be.","My wife and I often visit Rosales and the Ilokos as a matter of habit or whim induced by nostalgia, homesickness - whatever draws pilgrims to worshipped sanctuaries. Or, perhaps, what compels moths to seek the votive flame.","Colonialism subdues in many dulcet guises. It conquered under the pretext of spreading Christianity, civilization, law and order, to make the world safe for democracy.","All through history, a nation or a civilization's enduring glory is articulated by its mega constructions - the pyramids, the lofty cathedrals of the Christian world.","Poetry is emotion, passion, love, grief - everything that is human. It is not for zombies by zombies.","Class - or the economic status of individuals - is evident in all societies, some very well stratified by a rigid caste system determined by birth.","Contemplation is a luxury of the middle class, the very rich.","Japan is very cosmopolitan - it values its origins, but a world view hovers above this narrow perspective. The interest of the Japanese in their folk culture is transcendental.","You perhaps know me as a novelist. Literature is one of the arts - in fact, the noblest of the arts. That is not my opinion; it was first expressed by the ancients. As art, literature has many similarities with the other art forms.","From antiquity, Latin died but is still studied in seminaries and elite universities. So did Sanskrit in Asia. iI was replaced by Pali, but even Pali died, too. Linguists say the only ancient language which was resuscitated from the grave was Hebrew of Israel.","In the Western tradition, the first writers were teachers and historians, vastly traveled, who spiced their reports with fantasies. They were also poets who sang and entertained prince and pauper.","My reading of philosophy and history is desultory; I know so much and yet so little.","Poetry, fiction as novels or short stories - these are autonomous as created by their authors. They should stand on their own, like pieces of furniture that should be judged as to their usefulness, elegance.","You can't have integrity for breakfast, but try and keep it because it is perhaps the single most important word that defines not just writers but all human beings.","Writing is a solitary profession; you are really alone when you write. Then the emotions become well shaped and distinct. But their transition into words must be done deliberately and with rigid artistry.","I can imagine the writers of China, England and France, crippled and unsure of themselves when they feel that the ghosts of Confucius, Mencius, Chaucer and Shakespeare and Victor Hugo are looking over their shoulders.","Tourists as well as natives want to see cultural achievements - whether it's the Banaue Terraces, the old churches or museums.","Our appreciation of folk art will strengthen our identities, our pride in belonging to a community. People trained in the creative use of their hands soon acquire skills, excellent craftsmanship which will be the most important measure of how well we can industrialize.","I was a senior high school student at the Far Eastern University when the war with Japan broke out in 1941.","I said that if I were an industrialist or entrepreneur, I would invest in agriculture-based enterprises, for there is so much that can be done in manufacturing, in food preservation.","The ethnic differences among Filipinos are very real. The paucity of arable land, for instance, explains the industry of the Ilokanos and the Cebuanos.","Self-respect, the value of 'face,' is universal but is most pronounced in China, then in Japan where the Confucian ethic is most influential.","I am for poetry that is admired by peasant and aristocrat alike.","I do not want to be bored listening to music that is muffled and known only to the poet himself.","It was in the sugar hacienda in Negros, Panay and in Central Luzon where I saw the injustices heaped upon the sugar workers, particularly the sacadas, or seasonal workers.","In the '50s, I was traveling alone all over Mindanao, Basilan, all the way to Tawi-Tawi with just a camera and a notebook. I always stayed in the houses of Moros.","In a much larger sense, the problem of Sabah is directly influenced by the duplicity of imperial Britain. For whatever devious reason, the dismantling of the British empire created divisions and violence due to ethnic and religious differences.","Ninoy Aquino was a friend; I knew his faults, which were outweighed by his virtues.","For decades, as literary editor, I have followed the growth of our creative writing in English. In my Solidaridad Bookshop, half of my stock consists of Filipino books written in English and in the native languages.","The Japanese bureaucracy is unique. It is also very powerful, although it is now the object of so much criticism. Many of Japan's brightest made it a pillar of strength and continuity.","The Japanese covet important symbols - their heroic past as enshrined in Yasukuni, the Imperial family which has never been sullied by scandal.","The heart of the theater is the play itself, how it dramatizes life to make it meaningful entertainment. To achieve depth and universality, the playwright must subject himself to intense critique, to know human character and behavior, and finally to construct art from the most mundane of human experience.","What is needed in the theater, in fact for all our art forms, is a vibrant critical tradition.","To fund major cultural efforts, we must not rely alone on government and foundation patronage; if the farmer can spend for beer, he can pay for good entertainment which he can understand, which he can identify with and which will fortify his spirit.","We recognize the distinctness of Asian art when we turn to its traditional forms, recognize it as Japanese, Chinese and Indian, even Balinese or Thai.","We are shallow because our media are so horribly shallow. Every morning, I peruse the papers, and there is so little to read in them. It is the same with radio - all that noise, that artifice.","We are shallow because we are 'mayabang,' ego driven, and do not have the humility to understand that we are only human, much too human to mistake knowledge for wisdom.","Professional societies are sooner or later fractured by the ego of their leaders. Everyone wants to be president, chairman, CEO; no one wants to be a mere follower.","Literature - Eastern and Western - abounds with stories, myths, legends about the search for youth, for eternal life.","Past middle age, some friends suggested that I should have my eyebags removed, the deepening creases on my face stretched. I often examined my face in the mirror, imagining how I'd look if I followed the suggestion. I decided to retain the old mug. I was too familiar and comfortable with it. And the final hindrance: the cost.","For them who delay aging, who infuse decrepit bodies with youth and beauty - they must rejoice in the fullness of their deeds.","As artists, we must not go down to the level of the masa; we should bring them up, intellectualize our languages, create classics out of our folk arts. We can do this if we are true to our roots and strive for excellence.","I have always admired teachers because teaching, like the priesthood, medicine and writing, is a vocation. You don't become a teacher because you want wealth. It is the same with writing.","I write entirely in English; Tagalog chauvinists chide me for this. I feel no guilt in doing so. But I am sad that I cannot write in my native Ilokano. History demanded this; if it isn't English I am using now, I would most probably be writing in Spanish like Rizal, or even German or Japanese.","Christianity doesn't demand that we worship our ancestors. If we don't remember our ancestors, then, in all likelihood, we cannot also recall the distant past.","Like so many poor Ilokanos, my grandparents left their village, for it could no longer sustain them. The Ilocos is a narrow coastal plain where, so often, the mountain drops to the sea. Land hunger had always afflicted the Ilokanos and made them migratory.","I was born in an Ilokano village called Cabugawan. Most of the houses in it were roofed with thatch, pan-aw, a species of wild grass.","I tell young people who ask me about a future in writing not to go into it unless they get married to someone rich.","I regret that I have not written more, shouted louder, and acted out my beliefs.","What most readers do not realize is that it takes a particular genius to write funny, to satirize.","Some lucky people can be funny without half trying because they actually look funny, because acting funny is in their bones - fun as funny, not funny as crude slapstick.","At 86, I can easily look back to the last eight decades. Though memory often fails me now, so many images of the past are still clearly polished, and I can yet recall not just an abiding sense of place, but the keen smells, the sensory responses to the events of that past.","Always remember: the alleviation of poverty is never a political or economic issue - it is moral."],"F. W. de Klerk":["Above all, we owe it to the children of the world to stop the conflicts and to create new horizons for them.","The government that came into power after the April 1994 elections was going to need a budget. It was drafted by our finance minister, Derek Keys, and he convinced them of the necessity to stay within the free-market principles that had been in force in South Africa for decades.","I believe that first impressions are very important.","When I talk about the end of apartheid, I prefer not to claim the honor that I have ended it.","I played an integral part in helpings formulating that new vision... that we must abandon apartheid and accept one united South Africa with equal rights for all, with all forms of discrimination to be scrapped from the statute book.","The question that we must ask is whether we are making progress toward the goal of universal peace. Or are we caught up on a treadmill of history, turning forever on the axle of mindless aggression and self-destruction?","In our quest for peace, we should constantly ask ourselves what we should do to create conditions in which peace can prosper.","When I first met Mandela, we did not discuss anything of substance; we just felt each other out. He spent a long time expressing his admiration for the Boer generals and how ingenious they were during the Anglo-Boer war.","My predecessor, P. W. Botha, had an inner circle, and I did not like it. I preferred decisions to evolve out of cabinet discussions. That way, we achieved real co-ownership of our policies.","I have made the most profound apology in front of the Truth Commission and on other occasions about the injustices which were wrought by apartheid.","The relationship between me and President Mandela right at the beginning was not a very well-established relationship. It was based on two meetings.","What I haven't apologised for is the original concept of seeking to bring justice to all South Africans through the concept of nation states.","I felt a sense of fulfillment that an action plan, which I'd laid on the table on the 2nd of February 1990, had been fulfilled, had been properly implemented within the time frame which I envisaged.","It was fortunate in looking back for South Africa and its entire people that Mandela and I found it possible to work together even though big strains developed between us from time to time.","You cannot say we are a healthy, dynamic democracy when one party wins almost two-thirds of the vote.","For many years, I supported the concept of separate states.","It was an honour for me to have been able to work with Mr. Mandela in the process that led to the adoption of the interim constitution and our first democratic elections in April 1994.","President Mandela was not a hands-on president at any time.","The ANC party from time to time comes with legislation which, if accepted and if not nullified by the constitution of court, would have the effect of undermining the constitution and eroding its values."],"FKA twigs":["Being beautiful isn't everything... Sometimes it's interesting to show how you feel on the inside on the outside, just through expressing yourself.","I really enjoy the fun of putting something out and people liking it or hating it or talking about it, but vacuous attention, it feels disgusting. It's like a hangover.","Sometimes I feel 15; other times, I feel fully grown and mature and handling all my business. It can waver from day to day, hour to hour.","Vulnerability is the strongest state to be in. How boring would it be if we were constantly dominant or constantly submissive?","I don't know if I'm a tortured soul, but I was born heartbroken. I remember feeling it when I was so young. I was like, 'Mum, it hurts.'","I want people to see what's inside my head rather than just looking at me.","I'm an artist, and I'm a bit weird, and I'm probably a bit eccentric.","I was never the pretty girl at school. I'm tiny and mixed-race. I grew up in a white area. I was always the loner.","Racism is unacceptable in the real world, and it's unacceptable online.","I don't know any Beatles songs. My dad never listened to Elvis or Sting or Bowie. Any band name that's on a t-shirt, I probably won't know their music, like AC/DC or whatever. I don't know what that is. As a kid, I would sing along to artists like Tania Maria.","I'm the happiest when I'm in the studio, not on a beauty parade.","I'm in so many videos. There was a period of about two years where I danced for everyone: Kylie Minogue, Ed Sheeran, Jessie J, Taio Cruz. It got to the point where my fees were double the other girls', and I wouldn't even have to audition. They'd call my agent directly and say, 'We want twigs to come in.'","What makes me happy is having a really nice day out with my mum, or getting better at something I've been working hard at.","I love my music, so I want to produce, write, and serve my music. I've had to learn about EQ frequencies and programming and space and clutter and how to be a better piano or bass player - everything.","If you're an artist, you have to use everything to your advantage, even the pain.","I love things that are harsh and things that are too loud. And I love lulling people into a false sense of security. That's life.","I'm appealing to people who want something different, but the world, on the whole, doesn't really embrace different things. Not on the whole.","Obviously I know if you're putting yourself out there, saying, 'Hey! Listen to my music!,' with pictures of yourself in the magazines, then people are going to judge you. 'I hate her music. I hate her hair. I hate her production. I hate her videos.' Fine: don't care. That's the great thing about art: it's not for everyone.","I was always the poor kid, even though I very much tried to pretend to be the other way. Always well presented. Always really active in the school, doing fashion shows, plays, involved in every single aspect of the school. Overcompensating, I think, for the fact that I knew I wouldn't be going on the ski trip every January.","When I first put out music, people didn't know what I looked like. They called it a new type of something; they couldn't put a genre on it - it was where indie and urban kind of meet in the middle. I thought that was quite exciting.","I once said to a boy, 'You're a really good kisser,' and he said, 'You're only as good as the person you're kissing.' I think it's the same with the music.","It's weird: for someone who mostly really exists online, I'm actually not very interested in the Internet at all.","I definitely keep myself to myself; I don't really go out. If my friends want to see me, they know to come around to my house.","I moved to London to go to dance school when I was about 17, but then I realized that I didn't want to be a dancer anymore, so I dropped out after five or six weeks. All I wanted to do was sing and make music.","I feel confident that the work I've put in will make people see me as a music artist before anything else.","It's really easy to project this whole ideology of what being an artiste is, and I'm just not down with intellectualizing it. I just think, if you feel like doing something, then do it.","Fashion's important to me, but beauty fades. All that stuff is fun while it lasts, but anything can happen tomorrow. You've got to have so much more about you than the way you look or your clothes.","Textures apply to everything I do. Even within my music, I like smooth things, and then hard and fluffy things, all giving them their place to shine.","I've never been into the typical R&B voice, with runs and bluesy sounding words. That doesn't suit me.","I've soaked up so much through dancing, but I also have to be still. I want to be silent and read, to shut up and take time to respect the vision someone put into a book.","I write exactly what I think. If it's a raw subject, I write lots of things and then pull out all the fluff words.","When I first released music, and no one knew what I looked like, I would read comments like: 'I've never heard anything like this before; it's not in a genre.' And then my picture came out six months later: now she's an R&B singer.","I'm not going to become a costume version or caricature of myself; I like to morph.","I think we live in a culture where it is really difficult to get privacy because everything is so accessible. It's very difficult to maintain your comfortable life with a sort of mystique.","You have to recognize at some point that even though you have the passion and creative level to be able to do something, you might have to do a lot of prep. Sometimes you just can't do it as quickly as you want to do it.","I'm a country girl. The more big cities I go to, the more fashionistas and designers I meet who want to dress me, the more I have all these kind of superficial but amazing experiences, the more I just realize that I'm from Gloucestershire.","When I was younger, I had conversations with friends about wanting to create something different. Every young musician probably thinks that. But it's difficult to do, because there are only so many words, notes, melodies, songs. But as soon as I stopped thinking and started feeling, it worked. I didn't realize it till I was done.","In school, I had a tough time fitting in, and dancing was my way of being in my own element. As a teenager, I became a bit disillusioned with it. Even with competitions, I'd win, but still there would be tears.","I spent my whole teenage life trying to get to London and go to dance school, but when I got there, I couldn't wait to get to the clubs on weekends. I knew I wanted to make music.","Being a gal, people can be a bit patronizing. 'Oh, look at you using the computer.' They would never say that to a boy. And I don't let them do it to me.","I'm a strange person - I don't really get rewards out of how many hits I have on YouTube. I love it, and I'm grateful, and it's important to me. But does it equal peace within me? No, it doesn't.","A few years ago, I found out that there's a lot of Gypsy blood on my mother's side. I'm wild in that way - I've been brought up to do my own thing.","I'm not thirsty. I'm not a pop star. I don't want to reign over all forever... I don't want to be famous! It makes me feel sick, the thought of being a famous person. It's just not me.","Half of my life, I've had people staring at me because they think I'm funny-looking and ugly. The other half of my life, I've had people staring at me because they think I'm fascinating. Everything neutralises. It's more of a statement on society and how weird it is.","Twigs has been my nickname for years, and I guess a lot of people close to me called me Twigs, like, as a nickname. Before I even did dancing properly or anything, like, substantially creative, I was still Twigs.","I always felt like Tahliah's a very grown-up name to have. It's a pretty name when you're young, and then I think when I became a young lady, it felt kind of like a lot to grow into for some reason. I don't know. It sounds kind of regal. I never really liked it. I always felt like I couldn't live up to it."],"Fab Five Freddy":["I want to plug back into the hip-hop audience. Whether it be fans who grew up watching 'Yo!', or people who have become familiar with the culture via the Internet.","I was bringing the whole music, hip-hop, art, break dancing and urban cultural thing to the downtown table.","People actually perceived me with being this cat from the Bronx because I'm one of a handful of folks that was actually acting in 'Wild Style'.","Although I grew up as a fan of the culture from the disco D.J. era as a young kid and hearing the beginnings of hip-hop, I'm hearing it all from another borough in Brooklyn.","I'm just very pleased and thankful that there was a receptive audience of people that I was able to connect with."],"Fabiola Gianotti":["Diversity is really a richness for mankind.","Like in nature, I like things which are based on a few simple principles, even though their manifestation can be very rich.","It's always good news when you're closer to the truth.","Art is based on very clear, mathematical principles like proportion and harmony. At the same time, physicists need to be inventive, to have ideas, to have some fantasy.","Our laboratory is a place that celebrates diversity and is totally open to all differences, not just sex but also age, ethnicity, religion and other traditions.","For me, my home is a peaceful place where I can rest, and it gives me back energy.","There is nothing more exciting than having a life devoted to fundamental knowledge and to contributing to advance the borders of knowledge.","The top quark was discovered in 1995, and since then, the Higgs has become our obsession because the standard model was incomplete without it.","I like manual things, doing things with my hands, the feeling of touching.","The search for knowledge is a long and difficult task.","The training of younger generations is very close to my heart.","Among the questions we have in mind: dark matter, antimatter, and matter symmetry.","With the discovery of the Higgs boson, one of the questions has been ticked off the list, but there are many others. We hope that we can find answers or hints for answers to at least some of them. But of course, this is in the hands of nature.","Musical harmony is based on physical principles, while in cooking, ingredients must be weighed out with precision. At the same time, you have to be able to invent because if one follows the same recipe all the time, you never create anything new.","CERN is a concrete example of worldwide, international co-operation - and a concrete example of peace. The place which makes, in my opinion, better scientists, but also better people.","Working with so many people from all over the world is extremely enriching and stimulating.","Of course, mankind has made giant steps forward. However, what we know is really very, very little compared to what we still have to know.","CERN is a centre of scientific excellence and a source of pride and inspiration for physicists from all over the world, a cradle for technology and innovation, and a shining concrete example of scientific cooperation and peace.","We will have to be very vigilant that young female scientists have the same opportunities as their male colleagues.","In the big experiments, Atlas and CMS, we have something like 3,000 scientists each, and over 60 nationalities.","We know there must be new physics. For example, we cannot explain what dark matter is.","I will fully engage myself to maintain CERN's excellence in all its attributes, with the help of everybody, including CERN Council, staff and users from all over the world.","We had to understand things like why the top quark was so heavy and the electron is so light. The Higgs is a big, important step.","My efforts are focused on ensuring that CERN maintains a leading role in the fields of science, technology and education, and that it continues to be a place that unites scientists from around the world.","From a scientific point of view, our mission is to seek answers to the fundamental questions about the universe. Many are open - we don't know about dark matter, which accounts for a quarter of the universe's matter, nor do we know why there's antimatter.","Our research is so complex that the resources of a single region of the world are no longer enough - both intellectually and economically, it must be a global effort."],"Fabrice Grinda":["The most important impact on society and the world is the cell phone. Cell phones have actually been one of the primary drivers in productivity improvements.","Learn computer science. It's extraordinarily helpful. I like recommending learning economics as well so they think in terms of business, they have rational frameworks for looking at the world, but yeah, computer science is an amazing way to get into, even if you want to be CEO, having a tech background is helpful.","As an entrepreneur you keep trying things, and I try everything. I try business ideas, on our website we test everything, iterate, iterate, iterate.","I actually think the one who is underestimated in terms of impact he's had on society is Bill Gates. The reason is that with the innovation of software, he really allowed the computer revolution to take hold.","I could have probably been just as successful by not going to college, but it was the most intellectually stimulating environment that I was ever in.","If you're CEO of a company, you have to be a public person. You're speaking to the press, you're speaking to investors, you're speaking to employees, you're the public face of the company and so kind of naturally you become more extroverted, more outwards facing.","Forty percent of my portfolio is in the U.S. In the rest of the world, most of the places I invest in or invested in are Brazil, Russia, Germany with a little bit of Turkey, China, India, France and Israel sprinkled in there.","Is the button white or orange or green or yellow? Does it say 'sell', or 'sell now', or 'on sale' or 'for sale'? You test, you test, you test and most of the ideas you try fail and so I would argue I failed my way to success."],"Fabrice Luchini":["For me, French is so rich and so sacred that learning it is like learning a foreign language.","I am a free man. I don't need to earn money. But I need to love what I do."],"Fabrice Muamba":["You don't appreciate life until you get to the other side. Like lying in a hospital bed.","Family and God - that is what's important. Money, cars, those are things that come and go.","I am walking proof of the power of prayer.","For me there is no such word as 'luck' in the dictionary.","There's more to life than football, right?","I don't particularly get nervous about anything.","I'm a very competitive person.","I've lived most people's dream by playing football."],"Fabrizio Moreira":["Many people dream about being an entrepreneur, starting their own business, working for themselves, and living the good life. Very few, however, will actually take the plunge and put everything they've got into being their own boss.","Business is all about the customer: what the customer wants and what they get. Generally, every customer wants a product or service that solves their problem, worth their money, and is delivered with amazing customer service.","'No one can make you successful; the will to success comes from within.' I've made this my motto. I've internalized it to the point of understanding that the success of my actions and/or endeavors doesn't depend on anyone else, and that includes a possible failure.","The American Dream is that any man or woman, despite of his or her background, can change their circumstances and rise as high as they are willing to work.","No matter how frustrated, disappointed and discouraged we may feel in the face of our failures, it's only temporary. And the faster you can stop wallowing in guilt, blame or resentment, the faster you can put it behind you.","Real estate investing is unique in that it's almost as much a career or a way of life as it is a form of investing. Indeed, the fact that real estate is involves so much sweat equity makes it unique among other investments.","It is surprising how little most small business values the customers. A positive feedback from the customer is critical to your business, and what's more important is their referral.","Successful entrepreneurship takes complete dedication and careful strategizing along with market analysis. Plus, successful startups provide countless benefits to a healthy economy and consumers in need.","Fake news is a big thing in the field of Social Media Journalism. Fake news can be as simple has spreading misinformation.or as dangerous as smearing hateful propaganda.","Many people think that being a graphic designer means going to an expensive art school and buying expensive software that will cost you thousands of dollars. This is so far from the truth. There are hundreds of online education centers that offer top-notch graphic design training.","A big part of the anti-immigration narrative is the perception that the majority of immigrants are poor, uneducated, and unskilled.","A fascinating reaction of the human brain when we fail to meet a goal is that it tells us to throw caution to the wind and make things even worse, which ultimately leads to us giving up.","When you are just starting out with an online business, there's a good chance that you'll be making several mistakes. Because of the mistakes that can be made with starting an online business, many people decide to quit or think that online businesses are just a scam.","The business side of real estate investing is fraught with risk. Unlike purchasing mutual funds or savings bonds, with real estate, you can lose money; this is one of the reasons that seasoned real estate investors caution neophytes never to get too emotional about a property and always be willing to walk away.","Brexit was not a coup. Far from it. In the eyes of most analysts, it was a clear sign that people are frustrated and fed up with the status quo; this is particularly the case with independent voters.","I grew and learned, journeyed and understood, that someone who is afraid of failing won't get anywhere, and someone who dares to do it runs the risk of failure if they don't learn, correct their mistakes, and get back up.","Blogging can generate a great deal of traffic to your online business.","For an entrepreneur with 'improbable' and 'impossible' dreams, the alleged stability that comes from getting 'a real job' is nothing but a sign of slavery.","False news, when combined with social media, can wreak havoc thanks to its potential of reaching millions in a short span. The effects can be quite disturbing.","In 1995, the Clinton Administration reached an agreement with Cuban government that any refugee caught at sea would be sent back to Cuba while any refugee who reaches the United States shores would be allowed to begin the process to citizenship after one year.","Sure, if you're a well to do family, you always have the option of sending your children to private schools where teachers spend less time disciplining kids and more time teaching them. However, this option is beyond the reach of most households. And this is what makes school vouchers such a promising solution for lower and middle income families.","Raising the minimum wage represents a substantial financial burden for employers, particularly start-ups, early stage companies, and family-owned businesses. In response, business owners would be forced to either lay off workers or raise prices to offset the rise in labor costs.","If you can build a Facebook page and channel the audience to your website, you can generate revenue via PPC advertisement networks like Google Adwords, Taboola, Yahoo! Bing Network, AdRoll, 7Search, etc.","Can you imagine being Leonardo Da Vinci in the 1400s trying to describe his ideas for machines that would allow humans to fly to the average person of his time? This is hundreds of years before the invention of electricity, the internal combustion engine, and many other things we take for granted today.","The 'Fake News Alert' Chrome extension, created by 'New York Magazine' journalist Brian Feldman, identifies hoax news articles. However, cutting out fake news source entirely from operating is easier said than done, since anyone with internet access can create fake news.","Trump wants to build a wall at the border of Mexico, while Clinton wants to tear down all walls.","Together, the Jenner sisters have left their mark on the jewelry and fashion accessories industry, first with The Kendall & Kylie Collection at PacSun in 2012, the Metal Haven jewelry collection in 2013, and a line of shoes and handbags for Steve Madden in 2014.","Launching a successful product or startup has little to do with luck. Any business that gains traction on the market is the result of very careful strategizing and market analysis, not to mention the development of an original product or service.","Lower taxes will stimulate your own personal economy by leaving more money in your pocket to do what you want - invest, save, spend, buy a bigger house, a nicer car, and give to charity. And lower taxes also lead to more money for the government to use on those things they've promised you. It's a win-win for everyone.","Executive orders are meant for occasional use, not to force something through that the people's elected representatives aren't going to make law.","The study titled 'Impact of Immigration on Wages, by Education Level, 1994-2007' found that increased immigration had an effect of lowering wages for earlier immigrants by an average of 4.6 percent. Running counter to popular perception is the finding that for native-born Americans, wages actually increased by 0.6 percent.","Historically, there hasn't been a significant correlation between gold prices and U.S. elections. Furthermore, history has shown that gold prices tend to fall just before U.S. elections and rise immediately after, and this goes on until the next election.","Derogatory against women - it seems that Trump is not too keen about having women around him, maybe except for his wife and daughter.","The best part of owning a blog is the fact that you are in control. You can write about anything you want to write about. You can decide how your blog looks. You can decide who to target. You can decide how to monetize the blog. You have full control!","Cash flow is a problem for a small and developing company, and the lack of it is the reason why many small businesses fail. Ensure that you have enough money in your bank account to make you able to carry out daily basic needs for your business.","The day you decide to pursue your dreams, don't forget that this is a game you don't enter to compete, but to win. And there will always be someone booing you in the stands, and everything you accomplish could be jeered and hissed at. This is a game between two that you have to win for the people who came to watch you be triumphant.","Immigrants use debt intelligently. They understand the difference between active debt: creating a business, or something to make business better, and dead debt: buying that new sports car or the 60 inch television. Those things don't lead to the good life. They delay getting it.","Investing in gold is one of the wisest decisions that you can make as an investor.","By having a blog, you can make yourself very accessible to your target audience. You can leave comments open on your blog so you can learn exactly what your audience likes about what you're doing with your business and about what they think you should change.","While the Forbes Council does offer some benefits and opportunities for members, the Council may want to be careful going forward to avoid the many pitfalls that befell Trump University.","Although advertised as 'invite only', it has been reported by Forbes Council members and invitees that this 'invite' came with a membership fee.","One of the most important aspects that feed a thriving economy is successful businesses, so the more startups that take off, the better the financial picture is for everyone.","On the consumer level, the products developed by entrepreneurs help to provide more and better options that make life easier and more enjoyable in the everyday lives of the public.","When the government takes more money out of the pockets of middle class Americans, entrepreneurs, and businesses, it lessens the available cash flow for people to spend on goods and services, less money to start businesses, and less money for businesses to expand - i.e. creating new jobs and hiring people.","Raise the taxes, and we find less money in our pockets. Lower the taxes, and we've got more money in those pockets, and we spend it on all kinds of things.","Beware of politicians who tell you they'll do all these wonderful things for you for only a small tax increase. Those tax increases are never as small as you might imagine, and the benefits are always smaller than promised and/or imagined.","Mr. Trump, you were elected mainly because you found a way to connect with the average blue-collar worker who's sick of the games politicians have been playing for years. Those same blue-collar folks, who go to church, want to feed their families, have to pay their taxes.","Mr. Trump, Americans can't afford, and don't want, to worry about the latest lawsuit filed against their president. And you're not immune from these suits once you enter the Oval Office. Anything you've done before taking office is fair game.","America is unique in the world. If you don't believe that, just ask someone from another country.","When it comes to finances, immigrants are far savvier than native-born Americans. They keep their expenses low. They save their money.","With Donald J. Trump's arrival to power, many feel astonished by the growth of populism. Others analyze with extreme care the decline of companies that measure public opinion. I am saddened to watch the lack of temperament and political stability of those who 'represent' a trend or ideology.","For members of the Democratic Party, and progressives all over the world, it is difficult to overstate or hyperbolize the despair and dread that has descended upon them in the wake of President-elect Donald Trump.","The truth is that for a Democrat to triumph in a presidential election, it needs to come on the heels of 'the dark times' of an unpopular Republican administration. Carter followed the Nixon era, Clinton succeeded after 12 years of Reagan/Bush, and Obama was a direct result of eight years of Bush/Cheney.","Kennedy was like a rock star. Carter was the earnest outsider at the height of Washington cynicism. Clinton was a bad boy who proposed his 'third way' of Democratic politics, and Obama brought hope and change to a country that so desperately needed it.","It's more than a little ironic that the mantra that swept Bill Clinton into office is exactly what prevented Hillary from winning it. Somehow, the Manhattan billionaire became the voice of the disaffected blue-collar middle class in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.","The very phrase 'Make America great again' implies some kind of reset to a time long since passed. A mission to restore America to a previous default setting where American economic superiority was without peer, factories and manufacturing plants were humming, and jobs were plentiful for anyone who wanted one.","There are signs jobs will be plentiful in the future, if we train and prepare for it. That means investing in technology, innovation, and, as much as Republicans will hate to hear this, renewable energy.","One way to quantify the immigrant contribution to the overall economy is to measure their share of the U.S. economic output. One such examination for the years 2009-2011 found that immigrants contributed 14.7 percent of the total economic output.","Cuban Americans have little in common with immigrants from Mexico and Central America, and often their priorities don't align. If it seems like Cuban Americans don't have to play by the same rules as everyone else, that's probably because they don't.","If you're an independent voter, I'm willing to bet that you were not too happy at the prospect of hitting the polls on November 8, 2016. But let me guess - you did it anyway because after all, it's your civic duty, right?","If the 2016 election is any indication, every four years, millions more Americans will continue backing away from their own parties to choose a third party instead.","Voting third-party in 2016 meant choosing The Green Party's Jill Stein, the Libertarian Party's Gary Johnson, or Independent Candidate Evan McMullion.","Remember, your vote is not a wasted vote. Vote with your heart and think about the future generations the next time you vote.","As a small business owner myself, I talk to so many other business owners who delay seasonal hiring by waiting until the last minute to make their temporary hires.","Holiday hiring is only useful if you get the right people, and the consensus among HR professionals is that the most consistent and efficient means of finding good people is to use word of mouth.

On the other hand, Clinton is quite liberal and wishes to open the borders for more trades and more immigrants.","No connection to the average voter - Clinton has an air of superiority. Despite her wide smile and pleasant appearance, she is envisioned as someone who is trying to hide something all the time.","Social media has changed our lives forever. Some continue to reject social media, refusing to become one of the sheep, but you just can't avoid it.","A 2014 study commissioned by Facebook and done by Deloitte suggests that Facebook alone contributes almost $150 billion directly to the global economy, and when you add the peripherals, it nears $227 billion.","Microsoft, Disney, Ford, Facebook, and a hundreds and thousands of other companies that affect us daily all began life as baby companies, aka start-ups.","A writers' ring is where a group of four or five authors agree to promote each other's work on their own websites and via their social media outlets such as Facebook and Twitter.","In 1960, John F.

However, there are also many different types of business models that you can run from the comfort of your own home without having to reach too deep into your wallet.","Stock photos are used everywhere on the Net. Chances are, the website you are on right now uses stock photos somewhere - maybe as the featured image of the blog post. This also means that there will always be a large market for stock photographers.","Many people decide to jump from niche to niche, as they cannot find success immediately with the niche that they have chosen for their online business.","When you are starting to run an online business, you need to narrow down a niche market and be able to stick with it until you have a good profit coming in.

Once the money aspect is flowing, you can freely work on other aspects.","Almost anything worth doing involves some measure of risk - from learning to ride a bike, moving to a new city, and certainly, starting your own business. The point is that no one has ever started a business or created a new product with a guarantee of success.","The economic costs of starting your own business can be significant; in fact, most new startup companies fail because of undercapitalization.","Being an entrepreneur does, of course, give you greater freedom than someone who is tied to a fixed work schedule, but you'd be mistaken to think that you're going to have it easier than your 9-5 counterparts.","Starting a new business will take its toll on your time and energy, and this can place strain on family and social relationships, depending on their expectations and how open you are in your communication with them.","Relying on someone else to be successful only ties you down and limits you.","Anyone who is afraid to lose isn't ready to win."],"Facundo Pieres":["In Argentina, we're surrounded by polo ponies. The farm covers roughly 170 hectares, and there are no cattle or sheep, just horses.","We have the best sporting event in the world in polo, and yet it is weak.","I'm usually woken up by the birds and by my schnauzer, Rafa - for me that's the best start to the day. I jump out of bed, throw on some clothes, and race to the polo ground.","We have two trainers at the polo ground and do a mix of aerobics, gymnastics and stretches before we start riding. As polo players, it's very important for us to keep in shape. We do a bit of yoga and Pilates sometimes, too.","Buenos Aires is less than an hour's drive from the ranch, and in the evening, we might meet friends for dinner there. I get recognised a bit, but I'm lucky that polo isn't as popular as other sports.","When I was 12 or 13, I realised I was good, but I never knew how far I'd get.","I think polo players are at their best in their 30s. You've got the talent and the experience. You play with your head - you learn to lose and how to win.","I've got nothing to complain about. I have to enjoy and be grateful. Lots of people would like to be in my shoes.","When you get on a good horse, you just know. They are powerful, they stop quickly, they can turn in both directions, and they are fast.","Thanks to my father, we were always in good horses.","I've seen a lot of great players that couldn't get to the top because of horses, and I've seen a lot of normal players that got higher and higher because of horses.","If you don't have good horses, it's very tough to win."],"Fairfax Cone":["The inventory goes down the elevator every night.","Advertising is what you do when you can't go see somebody.

I was kind of familiar with the name Biggie Smalls, but I really wasn't that much into hip-hop at the time, so I really didn't know that was him. He said he didn't even know I was an artist on 'Bad Boy.'","I'm really an inner spirit that only makes itself known through the music. A lot of people think I'm an introvert, or quiet and moody. I've even heard some people say that there's a certain mystery or darkness about me. I'm not that way. I'm just really into what I do.","I can mourn internally, just be quiet about it. I have my moments but I'm not a real, expressive person, especially when it comes to like sadness.","Faith is not a sense, nor sight, nor reason, but taking God at His work.","I've certainly had to go through trying to change the fact that I was always identified as the widow of Notorious B.I.G. You know, I'm never going to be able to get away from having been married to him, but that's not what identifies me. You know, my life isn't just about that.","People used to say my son looked like a Mexican Biggie. And when he was first born, memories of Biggie... you know, we didn't always have the greatest days. For at least half the length of our marriage we were separated, so everyday was definitely not a good day.","My childhood was limited to mostly gospel music. We didn't have, like, a lot of records in our house, you know. It was like my grandparents who raised me. They were pretty old-fashioned in their religious ways, so it was like church, church, church, school, school, school.","I guess you kind of got to realize that once you in a marriage, whatever it is, you gotta deal with it. Not necessarily that you got to accept it, but you have to deal with it and try your best to make it work for you, for the both of you.","Big will always be a part of my life. But I'm still on this Earth, so I have to live my life for now and the future.","My business issues are just that - business - and I deal with them like they are business.","I don't have time to sit up and write songs all day. Maybe one day when my kids get older.","Certainly it is a blessing to have three beautiful kids who are all healthy. God put them here for me to nurture and bring them up and try to keep as close to right as I can. So it's a blessing. It's a big responsibility, but at the same time it's an honor."],"Faith Ford":["I love playing moms. It's a lot easier than being a mom, I hear.","One thing I think kids need to do is more chores, and take care of their own rooms. Responsibilities are really important to start them with. If they have animals, they have to feed them and care for them. That's the only way I think I could do it.","I have a friend that has five kids and she went through a trial separation with her husband, and she didn't have time to be upset. Every now and then, she'd call me on the cell phone and just cry.","My theory is, if you can do comedy and you can be in a scene with someone like Brad Garrett and hold your own, you've really got a future in this business.","I think comedy is one of the hardest things to do.","It takes a lot of energy to work, in general, especially if you're the lead in something.","Usually when you're working is when people want you to work. They don't want you as much when you're not working. That's the frustrating nature of our business.","I haven't actually spoken to my parents since the hurricane.","When I was in school, I was very involved with a lot of things. I was very very active. I couldn't say that I wasn't popular. I was a cheerleader when I was in junior high. I didn't make it in high school so I started a dance line.","My mother keeps me abreast of all the hometown things."],"Faith Hill":["I don't want to sound like a Hallmark card, but to be able to wake up each day with food and shelter, that alone is good. Forget aging and the fact that my butt is becoming a little more familiar with my knees than my tailbone. If you are six feet above ground it's a good day. So, give me more!","Country music is the people's music. It just speaks about real life and about truth and it tells things how they really are.","A little bit of stage fright, then I'm ready.","The foundation of family - that's where it all begins for me.","To be honest, I didn't really understand how involved putting a fragrance together could be - or would be. Once I made the choice to actually do it, I just went for it. I just dove in and have really learned a lot about putting a scent together. It's kind of exciting.","When I wake up in a bad mood, I try not to stay in one. Learn to make the best of what you have.","It's not complicated to embrace life. You just have to make the choice.","I try to find a reason to laugh each day. Somehow, if you can incorporate laughter into your day, every day, it really helps. It's the little things in life that make me happy.","I don't let things go unless I'm ready for them to go.","I think what makes our marriage work amid all the glare is that my husband is my best friend. He inspires everything in my life and enables me to do the best that I can. I want to hang out with him more than anyone.","Reba is very, very close to everyone around her. She's a classy lady.","I think beauty comes from within. If you're happy and look at life in the best way you can, even when there are problems, it can make you beautiful on the outside.","I have worries and fears just like everybody else. But I have every reason to wake up each morning and be very happy.","I'm a home girl. I like to stay home.","Shania Twain brought a whole other fan base to country music with her sound, the way the videos were produced.","I've always defended Shania. She not only opened doors; she knocked several down.","Everybody wants you to do good things, but in a small town you pretty much graduate and get married. Mostly you marry, have children and go to their football games.","Nashville was totally different than I ever dreamed. I had only seen the music business on television and been to a couple of concerts. I had no clue.","Children are easily influenced, and I always want to do things I can be proud to show my kids someday.","My goal as an artist is to always be true to who I am and give my fans music they will enjoy for a lifetime.","Country music fans are extremely supportive. Once they're with you, they're with you for life.","When you're a mom and you have three children, nothing bothers you. Trust me. Who cares what people say? I've got other things to deal with.","I'm a very independent woman.","I didn't realize that everyone was so attracted to my hair. I thought, well what about my music?","I wasn't a great background singer.","The song This Kiss was definitely my breakthrough song. After that, Breathe was my breakthrough album.","Nashville is one of the greatest places for the best songwriters in the world. It's been fantastic to live there and to raise our family there. It's a great town.","I'm very competitive but in a very nice way.","I'm still proud of what I've done, even if it hasn't been the biggest song on the radio or hasn't gone to number one.","A man who is right by your side through everything makes you happy. But he can leave your side to make dinner once in a while!","I constantly work at maintaining balance. For me, my family comes first. If my family is taken care of, then everything else usually falls into place.","When you're a mom to three children, nothing bothers you. Trust me. Who cares what people say? I've got other things to deal with.","There was a period of time when I first moved to Nashville, like the first couple of years, that I was just simply lost. I didn't know who I was; I didn't know really what I was doing here. I was meant to be a singer, but I just felt lost. That's when I went on the search for my birth family.","I can't even say what my greatest fear is because I, I can't even imagine. Being without my family... I can't even say it because it makes me cry.","I have had wrinkles on my forehead and my smile line since I was a kid. I see them in my own kids. I know what they're going to look like. So it's kind of like that's my personality. I feel the older you get, too, the more confident you become just in your own skin.","I think society, in general, is hard on women, period.","The hardest thing for me is planning ahead. My mom was brilliant at it.","I think I'm a lot like other moms out there who feel like if we don't have the pecan pie we have every year, then it just won't be Christmas.","I grew up asking for everything under the sun for Christmas, but I knew I wasn't going to get it all.","We're raising our girls to understand the real meaning of Christmas, and to know that it's most important to have Christmas in your heart. We go to our local mall and donate toys, and we say prayers for all the people in the world who might not be as lucky as we are.","There are things I've done in the past I'm not proud of - and I could talk about them if I wanted to - but I don't reveal my secrets... I prefer certain things to remain personal; there have to be boundaries. And I don't think you need a scandal to have an interesting story.","Marriage isn't something you agree to do one day, and if things don't go right, then it's over.","I have a wonderful family: My parents are churchgoing, salt-of-the-earth Southern people. They gave me a lot of love and are so unaffected by fame.","I'm able to shift gears from mom to performer to mom pretty quickly.","My family and my friends are most important to me. These people are my foundation.","This may sound funny, but I feel my most beautiful when I'm clean, fresh out of the bath. I don't have to be dressed up. I could be in comfy clothes at home hanging out with my family.","It's okay to take time for yourself. We give so much of ourselves to others and we need to be fueled both physically and mentally. If we are in balance, it helps us in all our interactions.","I drink a lot of water and I never leave the house without putting on moisturizer and lip gloss.","The only album that I listen to upon recording a new one is my 'Cry' album, because sonically, I think it's my best album to date. But other than that, I've never listened to my records, ever.","I love 'Somebody to Love' by Queen and of course 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is one of my favorites, just because it makes everyone in the room go crazy. Everyone tries to sing along with it, and half the room gets it right and the other half gets it wrong.","I'm such a happy, easygoing person.","I have this strength that comes from knowledge.","I don't know why 'happy' can't be a story.","I was adopted into this incredible home, a loving, positive environment, yet I had this yearning, this kind of darkness that was also inside me.","I know one of the reasons God gave me kids was to test my patience."],"Faith Hunter":["I adore burgers. I know they are bad for me, and only technically a sandwich, but a well made burger, juicy and hot off the grill, is wonderful!","Humans are insane. We kill our own people, starve our own people, sell them, work them to death, beat them, don't give them affordable/free/good healthcare, and let them live in misery, while a few of us have - we have all we want. We are evil.","Shelter dogs are the most loving, wonderful, sweet pets in the world. They understand being rescued, loved, and protected. The hubs and I have 2 rescued 11-yr-old Pomeranians, who adore us.","There are lots of antagonists in the 'Jane Yellowrock' series, but one stands out as uber-evil to me, and that is Lucas DeAllyon."],"Faith Prince":["I certainly went to New York because I was searching. Most people who go to New York are searching.","Usually I like playing other people. I like finding myself through other characters. But when you do cabaret, you are yourself. I think it's the most fun, and I tell you, if somebody had told me that, I would have done it fifteen years earlier than I did.","I've got all these great broads in me, all these character women. I was playing a torn-down stripper at twenty-five on Broadway, and now I fit the shoes.","I'm from the South, so I tend to tell stories. That's how we express ourselves.","My happiest times in the theater are when I do ensemble pieces. I really got into theater because of that closeness.","I don't like to read reviews. Even the good ones you start to analyze: 'Oh, did I do that? I have to make sure I do that again.'","I'll tell you something: my dad was a nuclear engineer and he was really bright, and I've always said that because of negotiating at such a young age with my dad, it was really such a gift because I could then negotiate with very difficult personalities - and not end up being the scapegoat. I learned to really pick and choose my battles.","Sometimes directors may not give you words, you know? They may not talk at all! You've just got to use your radar to figure out how you can get to the center and not lose yourself, but still be directed at the same time.","Half of me is this wacked-out comedienne who will do anything for a buck and a laugh. Well, at least for a laugh. But the other half is a lot darker, sadder and more pensive. It's the dark side that feeds the outrageousness and allows it to surface. I think that's true for anyone with comic flair.","Being funny is a symptom of what's underneath. You're pumping out all that energy because something else is going on inside you, some opposing force, something uncomfortable.","I know I always had a lot of energy growing up and I had to put it somewhere. Theater allowed me to really feel things, to laugh, to cry, to explode outward. I could do anything and it was totally accepted and appreciated. If I hadn't gone into the theater, I probably would have been a psychotic killer.","All I can say is that I've always felt like a very old soul. When I was 3, I felt 60.","I'm a character actress. I'm the girl next door, the aunt, the quirky cousin. You have to innately know who you are and be happy with that.","I just love kids. I always have.","I have a very 'theatre' face. I have what they call a wide mask. I probably would have been a big film star in the '20s with the silent films where they used a lot of key lighting, and make-up carved out your face.","I never like to be the same, whether it be comedy or drama, funny or serious."],"Faith Ringgold":["I just feel like I'm the luckiest person in the world being able to do what I love and be able to do it all day every day if I like, you know, I mean it's great, I love it.","I had something I was trying to say and sometimes the message is an easy transmission and sometimes it's a difficult one but I love the power of saying it so I'm gonna do it whether it's hard or easy.","Because the mask is your face, the face is a mask, so I'm thinking of the face as a mask because of the way I see faces is coming from an African vision of the mask which is the thing that we carry around with us, it is our presentation, it's our front, it's our face.","I think that has been a benefit to me because I think most people understand quilts and not a lot of people understand paintings. But yet they're looking at one.","I had this idea that I wanted to do this mixture of visions of African American women and visions of African American men. And call it 'The Men' and call it 'The Women' and show different faces of these two people.","I guess I had fun doing it but it has hard memories for me.","I'm not so presumptuous to feel that they're gonna get it right away, get exactly what I have in mind. I hope that they'll enjoy looking at it at any rate, whatever it is. And that's why I started writing stories on my work."],"Faith Salie":["Did you know you're supposed to soap and scrub for as long as it takes to sing 'Happy Birthday' twice?","Women are blessed with lots and lots of extra ways to win or lose validation. If you're a woman, you'll be judged on your beauty and your wit and how often you smile. You'll be judged on how much hair you have in some places and not in others.","Twerking takes its place in a long line of dance moves deemed immoral, even apocalyptic. The waltz was called sinful because it demanded dangerously close contact between dance partners. In 1914, the tango earned a papal denunciation for being 'damaging to the soul.'","Mothers of all ages delight in their children, but I don't know that, if I were younger, I would feel as acutely, profoundly, preciously grateful for every smile, squeal, and - yes - diaper blowout.","Social media provides a constant platform on which to feature what we deem beautiful, meaningful, and worthy.","Mother's Day is a bittersweet day for many of us. We all have mothers, but some of us have lost them.","Sometimes art helps illuminate science.","Harassment doesn't just happen to 'social observers' and 'comedians' - women who express themselves publicly are reliably verbally attacked online and in person, not for their substance but for their form.","Just as kids need to learn to respect their elders, we are a society that increasingly respects our youth.","I'll never get complacent. I am my own toughest critic.","Despite amazing advances in fertility to help older women get pregnant, the complications, increased chances of autism, and chromosomal abnormalities are significant considerations.","I've always wanted, notionally, to be a mother. And I was certain I would be, because everyone I know, gay or straight, married or single, rich or not so much, who truly wants to have a child figures out a way, some way, to have one - whether through adoption, fostering, surrogacy, fertility, accident, or persistence.","Boys have always known they could do anything; all they had to do was look around at their presidents, religious leaders, professional athletes, at the statues that stand erect in big cities and small. Girls have always known they were allowed to feel anything - except anger.","Real love is more than a one-time, seemingly iron-clad pledge that we will never be apart. If you're over 20, you've probably figured out that meaningful love isn't constricting; it doesn't chain you to one place or to each other.","People who champion Trump say they don't want politics-as-usual. But 'politic' is also an adjective. It means 'tactful and diplomatic.' It's necessary for an elected official to be politic.","The boy taught from infancy to be tough is emotionally doomed.","I entered my egg-freezing adventure from a feeling of lack - a lack of fertility, of the right partner, of biological time. But this perceived lack actually produced abundance - of options, time, peace of mind, and microscopic chances of a child.","I think there's something very disingenuous about literally all people who say that they don't care about anyone's approval.","A leader who cobbles together his self-esteem by attempting to silence or libel his critics and by amplifying his echo chamber is a dangerous one indeed.","If you grasp the bathroom door handle to exit without using a paper towel, you're right back where you started, with who-knows-whose germs on your hands.","Not that I'm any good at it, but the beauty of meditation is that it liberates us from our own thoughts.","If you're ever bcc'd, do not go near 'reply all.' 'Bcc' is 'blind carbon copy.' It means you're a fly on the wall, dude! If you hit reply all, it's beyond bad etiquette to out the person who gave you the superpower of invisibility. It's like screaming, 'I'm a spy!'","Approval makes the world go round, even if many of us want to transcend our hunger for it.","Making fun of people's looks is something that children do - mean children - and, in fact, linguists have determined that Trump actually speaks like a 3rd grader.","It's one thing to decry and defy political correctness in the name of efficiently achieving clarity or revealing an honest truth. But it's quite another thing entirely to support name-calling and nastiness.","I don't think, in my entire 18 years as a student, I ever used an exclamation point in an academic paper.","No longer is a geek identifiable by a pale complexion, black-rimmed glasses, a bowling shirt that says 'Nerd World Order.' No, geeks are everywhere. And they're cool!","Nothing ages you more immediately than being called 'Mrs.'","When I was a kid, we called every teacher, every parent - anyone over the age of 20, it seemed - 'Mr. or Mrs. so-and-so.'","The option to freeze one's eggs is just about the most empowering choice a single woman who knows she wants to be a mother can make.","I've spent my life being responsible, building a career, and waiting to find the right partner with whom to start a family.","Any responsible essayist or memoir writer who's writing about herself is not just saying, 'Here's what happened,' and opening up her diary. There needs to be consideration of other people's feelings.","There's a bit of a reluctance on my part to promote myself as any kind of hero because the things I've had to overcome in my life are not the deepest, darkest things.","The desperate hunger our president has for approbation has led him to such lengths as claiming that God stopped the rain during his Inauguration. In fact, Mother Nature made sure it rained on Trump's hair the minute he started his speech.","Power is not nearly enough for Trump. Power he already possessed, starting with the money his father gave him, which grew into the money he never paid in taxes because he is 'smart.' No: Power and ambition pale in comparison to Trumpbeth's rapacious grab for applause.","Approval ratings matter for politicians, largely for good reason. A leader with plummeting approval ratings ought to take note of the needs and hopes of his people.","Shaking hands is a pretty good way to get yourself sick, not necessarily with Ebola, but with a million other germs that can cause colds and flu.","The custom of clasping hands is thought to date back thousands of years, as proof of not holding any weapons.","I'm writing a book, and there's not even space for a desk in our home. So I spent my hard-earned book money and rented the small apartment downstairs from us.","'Man cave' seems retrograde, but 'she shed' seems progressive. Or maybe it's just a place for me to eat embarrassing amounts of chocolate in private.","Women all over this great land are creating spaces just for themselves, most often out of sheds in their backyards. They're fantasy cottages, bespoke bungalows, 'mama maisons,' if you will, for mothers and wives who need a sanctuary - a haven where they can do anything, or nothing.","As a mother, I don't want any girl twerking near my kid at a bat mitzvah.","In case you don't watch much TV or spend time with anyone under 40, 'Really?' is pop culture's pithiest way to deliver a withering put-down.","I'm not actually perishing, but I do feel like I die a little every time someone uses 'literally' to mean 'really.'","Adverbs, we know, are meant to modify a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. They help us understand things more clearly, more vividly, more... morely.","By the time I got to college in the '90s, virtually every young woman I knew was on the pill. It was like a rite of passage, along with Doc Martens and Take Back the Night rallies.","Scientists have discovered that, as we age, our brains act like computers with fuller and fuller hard drives. So when we're trying to recall a fact or a word or a name, it takes us longer, because - to put it scientifically - our brains hold a lot of 'stuff.'","I'm no scientist, but I'll dare extrapolate and say that it's pretty obvious that the more you struggle to recall something, the smarter you are!","John Travolta is getting old, despite what his hair is trying to tell us.","Was Hugh Hefner a libertine or a dirty old man? Someone who empowered women or commodified them? The answer is yes!","This is America; our icons are complicated.","Wanting to be loved and appreciated connects us all.","Contrary to the negative stereotype that folks who swear have poor vocabularies, a fluency in taboo language correlates with overall verbal fluency. The more words you know, the more you know... and the more colorfully you can express yourself, with nuance, metaphor, and emotion.","My husband is a graduate of two Ivy League universities - with a degree in Classics! - and he sounds like a David Mamet character when I hear him on a business call.","I'm squandering invaluable gray matter by censoring myself.","I remember my mom sitting at our kitchen table, paying bills with a small smile. She'd sigh and say, 'I'm so blessed to be able to pay these.' She knew it was about what you have.","I tell my kids all the time that I'm so lucky they chose me to be their mom.","Manspread, mansplaining, manterrupting - all of it, whether conscious or not, diminishes women's voices, minds, and bodies.","If you don't know what mansplaining is, or manterrupting or manspread, then you're probably a guy.","I don't mean to brag, but my water filter curates tap water, offering moi the finest combination of H, 2, and O available.","I think the curation consternation is this: Just because you like something or list something, are you really curating?","One man's content is another woman's crap. And the crappy content - let's call it crontent - will never go away.","The fact that oversharing exists at all as a noteworthy notion is a relief, because I'm afraid that our younger generations could grow up having no idea what it even means to overshare.","It's beyond TMI - oversharing is not just too much information; it's incessant sharing of non-information - breaking news about your gluten-free diet complete with duck face selfies.","To my knowledge, there are, pretty much, two ways to be interesting: One is to actually do interesting things, achieve the remarkable. The other way to be interesting is to be interested, curious about the world and about other people - not relentlessly revelatory about yourself.","If I could have had my baby sooner, I would have, simply to spend more years with him.","I'm an old mom of a young baby, and every moment matters.","I'm a snowflake. And so are you. Your children are snowflakes. And so are mine. And those who protest the loudest about not being snowflakes? I can see your six-fold ice crystals from here! Because every person, empirically, is unique.","Snowflakery is simply being human, which makes it a pretty flakey insult.","It's fitting that an insult largely aimed at youth has made children of those who use it. 'Snowflake' reminds us how much we need climate change... in politics.","I once accidentally 'replied all' and sent an email complaining about my then-boyfriend to a bunch of strangers. It was meant for my friend who was a bride, but I ended up addressing her entire wedding party. Her marriage lasted; my relationship didn't.","We all think Al Gore invented email so we could save time and save paper, to save trees. And that includes phone trees.","Here's a simple guideline: if five names or fewer are cc'd, just go nuts and hit 'reply all.' But if more than five folks appear in the cc line, pause. Give it a thought. Some people are promiscuous and cc dozens of people who don't need to know each other's business.","I'm not proud that, in my time, I've tried to harness the power of prayer to fit into a pair of jeans.","Having grown up Catholic, my prayers were scripted - memorized and deployed in church and before bed. As a young adult, I veered off script and talked to God more plainly. And by 'talked to,' I mean that I basically asked for things to turn out the way I wanted them to.","They say there are no atheists in foxholes, and in the foxhole of my divorce, I found solace in walking to St. Patrick's Cathedral and lighting candles.","I asked God for a healthy baby. An answer arrived in my daughter.","I am an approval junkie.","Famous people I've interviewed - powerful people, brilliant people, people whom you look at and think, 'Seriously, do you not have pores?' - have turned to me after interviews and asked, 'Was I okay? I hope I was okay.'","For weeks I ran through a mental inventory of my closet. Did I want to wear something new - to christen it and forever make it The Divorce Dress?","Whenever I told women - friends or acquaintances - that I had to go to divorce court, they'd invariably, without skipping a beat, ask, 'What are you going to wear?' It was like instant female solidarity: of course it mattered what I was going to wear.","Divorce court seemed to inspire in my girlfriends 1940s-era fashion fantasies, not only for me, but for themselves.","On a meaningful day, everything you wear can have meaning. It becomes what I wore That Day, whether that day is a beginning or an end.","Am I an elitist because I like wine?","It was my husband who had to open all the baby shower gifts which were haunting me in their candy-colored gift wrap - thank you notes demanding to be written.","I have no problem being full-term pregnant and do not understand women who say, 'I can't wait to get this baby out of me!'","I know how much sleep I need, how much time on the elliptical I need, and how much chocolate that buys me.","Whether you plan to labor with an epidural or the Pitocin Fairy pins you down or you end up having an emergency C-section, there are still choices you can make throughout your entire birth experience that allow you to feel some control over what is probably the most dramatic day of your life.","Getting a pedicure seems to be a standard pre-birth ritual, presumably because it is relaxing and makes you feel pretty even though your little piggies are going to be covered in those awesome no-skid hospital socks which I kept on for three days.","Well-done eyelash extensions make you look beautiful and doe-eyed without a lick of makeup.","If you want to become a mother, you can. I promise. It may not happen the way you think, but it's possible. It just takes a combination of a little planning and a lot of living your life.","My first husband and I never came close to having kids.","I spent my late twenties and all of my thirties figuring out what I was supposed to be doing and where my home was.","Most of my best friends had children in their early 40s.","Donald Trump, who surely has lots of high-stakes issues on which to focus, is consumed with the appearance of women.","Wildfires can leave the land with burn scars that last for years.","Are we a people who put politics over integrity? Or are we a country of voters and leaders, men and women, husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, colleagues, humans who care about treating each other with basic dignity?","Hours after I gave birth to my first child, my husband cradled all five pounds of our boy and said, gently, 'Hi, Sweetpea.' Not 'Buddy' or 'Little Man.' Sweetpea. The word filled me with unanticipated comfort.","The t-shirts that declare 'Girls Rule the World' offer an empirical falsehood, but at least the aspiration is there.","I admit I feel funny when I use the word 'whom' as I'm talking to my diapered children, but I persist."],"Faizon Love":["One of my favorite guys when I was young... I've always loved Bill Cosby. I've always wanted to direct him in something.","'The Replacements' is where I met Jon Favreau, and we just clicked like, you know, like kids at a camp.","'The Replacements' is where I met Jon Favreau, and we just clicked like, you know, like kids at a camp. And he wrote my next movie, which was 'Made.'"],"Falk Hentschel":["Every show finds its groove, I would say. The first season is the season to figure out the dynamics, the workflow.","My mom was a huge fan of 'Dirty Dancing.' I couldn't quite get a break, and she was like, 'Patrick Swayze was a dancer!' And Fred Astaire. I started dancing, and it led me to acting. It helps with fighting or whatever choreography in general.","I was a dancer for about 14 years. I was a martial artist for the same amount of time. I quit that when I realized I should probably not get my nose broken anymore. I love trying new stuff. Now I'm loving archery, and I surf. I just like to explore new things, I guess. I'm a big kid!","I was born in East Germany, before the wall came down. We sort of escaped, I guess. I grew up all over the place. Germany, London, back and forth between Minnesota and Germany. I was sort of an army brat, but not in the army.","I think Hollywood wants to be safe. The things you do first become your calling card, and I think people just sort of go, 'Well, we know he can do that.' They kind of put you in that hole.","To be honest with you, I've been dying to do a nice indie feature - just something about a regular guy with a big quirk or a big emotional problem. Just something that's a straightforward, classic indie film. It sounds weird, but it's been easier for me to get cast in big tentpole films than the indie community. I'd love to do that."],"Famke Janssen":["I am attracted to the dark side of life!","Disneyland is supposed to be the happiest place on Earth and I have to say when I'm riding around in that crazy Space Mountain ride I'm happy.","The only way to do is just to go for it, otherwise it ends up looking phoney.","I try not to have high expectations of people because it just sets you up for disappointment, but it's great to work with actors who are that talented and accomplished.","I'm intrigued by the dark. Out of darkness comes creation.","We've always been ready for female superheroes. Because women want to be them and men want to do them.","Just because you're of the same sex, what difference does it make? Get married to whomever you want.","I always feel like I want to do my career my own way. I never follow anybody's path, what they've done.","I want to work with great directors. I want to work on good material with good actors. I've probably done 20 movies at this point and a lot of independents. It's been an incredible ride and I love it and I'm just going to keep going and doing what I'm doing.","It's never been important to be a huge star or to have some breakout role. If you're the lead, you get a lot more screen time and you get a lot more chances to develop that character more thoroughly than you would if you do it in a little supporting part.","Robert De Niro... It seemed like a pretty cool thing to do to put his name on my resume next.","I love scary movies. The Shining and Don't Look Now are two of the best.","Everybody gets typecast in movies, but you have to make wise choices. I'd say around 90 percent of movie casting is about the way you look, so you have to fight that. If producers had their way, I'd only be in action films, but I'm interested in a more varied career than that.","I like to go from mainstream movies to more artsy films. I don't sign on for the money. Maybe I should, but I don't. There's always a good reason for doing something.","I don't know how to cook and there's so much work involved you have to buy the groceries and prepare them. I like it when people cook for me, or I'll just order some take-out.","I have a friend in New York who's a stylist and I went over to her place because she's got a lot of clothes. I basically ended up wearing most of it. So it's all stuff that I brought over.","I love the first two X-Men movies because I thought that Bryan Singer did such a great job. He elevated that whole genre. He's a very talented director.","I know Dark Phoenix is a huge part of the X-Men saga, so I'm assuming they're at least going to want to touch on it, but I don't know and I don't know whether I would want to be involved. That depends on many different things.","I live in New York. I don't really particularly want to move to LA.","Triple tonguing? It was sort of invented. It wasn't in the script. It was something that I came up with.","I'm trying to fight typecasting as hard as I can, while I have time.","Once you achieve a certain level of success or fame, it becomes really difficult to go against type.","If you do well as an actor, a good director will pick up on it, and keep it in the film.","I don't watch TV.","There's certain things I try to avoid, as an actress, just to keep my world from being as narrow as it could be.","The Dutch are a very practical people.","I personally like to do independent films.","I like the work that I get to do.","My French is still good. That's a beautiful language and I'm happy to speak it.","I'm 5' 11\" as I proudly say - just so I don't have to say six feet.","As a European I had fit in almost seamlessly in New York for the last 25 years, but in Oklahoma I stood out like a sore thumb.","I love stories about two people who are doing illegal things, who we really enjoy watching despite the fact that we know they are doomed in some way.","During my first visit, I was really struck by how deeply religious many Oklahomans are. It is a very conservative state and as somebody who grew up in a very liberal country, it was jarring to me at first.","Film has played such a big part in my life, in my impressions of the United States.","I think there's a big misconception out there about actors and the choices they have.","When someone holds a knife to your throat it's easy to be scared. It's not hard to imagine what it would be like.","I always feel like I want to do my career my own way.","I never follow anybody's path, what they've done.","The great thing I think when you do independents is that people are really there for the same reason. They're not there because they got a lot of money and they want to just go home and get it over with. They're there because they believe in the script or the director or the cast or whatever it is, and they want to make it work.","I've lived in New York for a really long time.","In studio films, everything has to be boxed in, everybody needs to know beforehand - this is comedy, this is sci-fi, this is drama - and what's the point of independent film if you don't get to experiment?","I keep pushing buttons and trying to grow as a person and as a filmmaker.","I look a certain way. I have a very specific kind of look.","You don't ever know with films. You just hope for the best, but sometimes it's a bit of a crapshoot.","I think every movie is its own little world, and a director certainly sets the tone.","Netflix is something I watch.","I started as a model in Holland and Chanel took me to New York when I was 19, after which I decided to stay.","I enrolled in an acting workshop and my first acting role was on the TV soap opera 'Melrose Place.'"],"Fan Bingbing":["I have nothing to explain. As for being misunderstood, I have grown accustomed to that.","Awards are not the only markers of success; I don't judge myself just based on them. I believe that each cinema-goer has his own mental trophies.","I am a very frank person and that's how I hope to remain. What you see is what you get.","I carry an umbrella when I am outdoors and always wear sunscreen, even when I am sitting in front of a computer screen! I never touch coffee or other caffeinated drinks.","I always carry lip balm and lipstick. Lipstick is a very important beauty product because I find that lips are the most beautiful feature of anyone's face.","Also, I use facial masks diligently. I use at least two a day - one for moisturizing and one for whitening. I think I go through at least 600 sheets of facial masks every year.","I fell in love with dressing myself up."],"Fannie Farmer":["Progress in civilization has been accompanied by progress in cookery.","I certainly feel that the time is not far distant when a knowledge of the principles of diet will be an essential part of one's education. Then mankind will eat to live, be able to do better mental and physical work and disease will be less frequent."],"Fannie Flagg":["Yes, I suffer terribly from depression. I have to work at being happy, it's not my natural instinct. My natural instinct is, if something wonderful happens, to throw water in my own face.","In order to be Miss Anybody you had to have excellent grades, and I had terrible grades because of my dyslexia.","Remember if people talk behind your back, it only means you're two steps ahead!","Strangely enough, the first character in Fried Green Tomatoes was the cafe, and the town. I think a place can be as much a character in a novel as the people.","Being an only child and losing both my parents at an early age, I have found that the friends I have made over the years are the people who help me get through life, good times and bad.","I have a lot of friends that are ex-Miss Alabamas and ex-Miss Georgias.","I think that people that are not sensitive, who seem to bang through life, do survive, but I don't think they get the really soaring feelings that people who are more artistically bent can get."],"Fannie Hurst":["It takes a clever man to turn cynic and a wise man to be clever enough not to.","A woman has to be twice as good as a man to go half as far.","Few enjoy noisy overcrowded functions. But they are a gesture of goodwill on the part of host or hostess, and also on the part of guests who submit to them.","Any writer worth the name is always getting into one thing or getting out of another thing.","Sex is a discovery.","I'm not happy when I'm writing, but I'm more unhappy when I'm not.","Some people think they are worth a lot of money just because they have it."],"Fannie Lou Hamer":["I am sick and tired of being sick and tired.","With the people, for the people, by the people. I crack up when I hear it; I say, with the handful, for the handful, by the handful, cause that's what really happens.","If I fall, I'll fall five feet four inches forward in the fight for freedom. I'm not backing off.","Nobody's free until everybody's free.","White Americans today don't know what in the world to do because when they put us behind them, that's where they made their mistake... they put us behind them, and we watched every move they made.","Why should I leave Ruleville, and why should I leave Mississippi? I go to the big city, and with the kind of education they give us in Mississippi, I got problems. I'd wind up in a soup line there.","Is this America, the land of the free and the home of the brave, where we have to sleep with our telephones off the hooks because our lives be threatened daily, because we want to live as decent human beings in America?","What I really feel is necessary is that the black people in this country wil have to upset this apple cart. We can no longer ignore the fact that America is not the... land of the free and the home of the brave.","I feel sorry for anybody that could let hate wrap them up. Ain't no such thing as I can hate anybody and hope to see God's face.","There is one thing you have got to learn about our movement. Three people are better than no people.","People have got to get together and work together. I'm tired of the kind of oppression that white people have inflicted on us and are still trying to inflict.","One day, I know the struggle will change. There's got to be a change - not only for Mississippi, not only for the people in the United States, but people all over the world.","Every red stripe in that flag represents the black man's blood that has been shed.","That's why I want to change Mississippi. You don't run away from problems - you just face them.","If the white man gives you anything - just remember when he gets ready he will take it right back. We have to take for ourselves.","I know lots of people in Mississippi who have lost their jobs trying to register to vote.","I'd been in jail, and I'd been beat. I had been to a voter registration workshop, you know, to - they were just training and teaching us how to register, to pass the literacy test.","I'm showing the people that a Negro can run for office.","It was the 31st of August in 1962 that eighteen of us traveled twenty-six miles to the county courthouse in Indianola to try to register to become first-class citizens. We was met in Indianola by policemen, Highway Patrolmen, and they only allowed two of us in to take the literacy test at the time.","They talked about how it was our rights as human beings to register and vote. I never knew we could vote before. Nobody ever told us.","On the 10th of September 1962, sixteen bullets was fired into the home of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Tucker for me.","I was forced away from the plantation because I wouldn't go back and withdraw, you know, my literacy test after I had tried to take it. I wouldn't go back.","They - you know, when we walked in - when I walked in with the two white men that had carried me down - and they cursed me all the way down. They would ask me questions, and when I would try to answer, they would tell me to hush.","I had to leave, and my husband was forced to stay on this plantation until after the harvest season was over. And then the man that we had worked for, he'd taken the car, and the most of the few things we had had been stolen.","We hadn't heard anything about registering to vote because when you see this flat land in here, when the people would get out of the fields, if they had a radio, they'd be too tired to play it. So we didn't know what was going on in the rest of the state, even, much less in other places."],"Fanny Brice":["Let the world know you as you are, not as you think you should be, because sooner or later, if you are posing, you will forget the pose, and then where are you?","Being a funny person does an awful lot of things to you. You feel that you mustn't get serious with people. They don't expect it from you, and they don't want to see it. You're not entitled to be serious, you're a clown.","Wrong is for other people.","Affectation is a very good word when someone does not wish to confess to what he would none the less like to believe of himself.","Personal beauty is a greater recommendation than any letter of reference.","Your audience gives you everything you need. They tell you. There is no director who can direct you like an audience.","I never liked the men I loved and never loved the men I liked.","Men always fall for frigid women because they put on the best show."],"Fanny Burney":["Traveling is the ruin of all happiness! There's no looking at a building after seeing Italy.","I am ashamed of confessing that I have nothing to confess.","To despise riches, may, indeed, be philosophic, but to dispense them worthily, must surely be more beneficial to mankind.","I cannot sleep - great joy is as restless as great sorrow.","But if the young are never tired of erring in conduct, neither are the older in erring of judgment.","For my part, I confess I seldom listen to the players: one has so much to do, in looking about and finding out one's acquaintance, that, really, one has no time to mind the stage. One merely comes to meet one's friends, and show that one's alive.","In the bosom of her respectable family resided Camilla."],"Fanny Crosby":["Can ye fathom the ocean, dark and deep, where the mighty waves and the grandeur sweep?","The angel of mercy, the child of love, together had flown to the realms above.","Chords that were broken will vibrate once more."],"Fanny Howe":["I grew up reading 19th-century novels and late Victorian children's books, so I try for a good story full of coincidence and error, landscape and weather. However, the world was radically changed during my lifetime, and I tell of that battering as best I can.","My novels are about a generation of Americans who lived between 1940 and 2000, who resisted the postwar political and cultural forces by choosing a wandering life of impoverishment and wonder. Inevitably, race and economics are a big part of their stories. Childhood, childishness, and children are never far.","In poetry, I have, since very young, loved poetry in translation. The Chinese, the French, the Russians, Italians, Indians and early Celts: the formality of the translator's voice, their measured breath and anxiety moves me as it lingers over the original.","I was a go-go dancer at the Dom on East 10th Street in NYC. This was a glittering ballroom over Stanley's Bar. 1965.","If someone is alone reading my poems, I hope it would be like reading someone's notebook. A record. Of a place, beauty, difficulty. A familiar daily struggle."],"Fanny Kemble":["I have been out again on the river, rowing. I find nothing new.","I have sometimes been haunted with the idea that it was an imperative duty, knowing what I know, and having seen what I have seen, to do all that lies in my power to show the dangers and the evils of this frightful institution.","A great number of the women are victims to falling of the womb and weakness in the spine; but these are necessary results of their laborious existence, and do not belong either to climate or constitution.","But I do not admit the comparison between your slaves and even the lowest class of European free labourers, for the former are allowed the exercise of no faculties but those which they enjoy in common with the brutes that perish.","I have been taking my daily walk round the island, and visited the sugar mill and the threshing mill again.","I said I thought female labour of the sort exacted from these slaves, and corporal chastisement such as they endure, must be abhorrent to any manly or humane man.","In the north we could not hope to keep the worst and poorest servant for a single day in the wretched discomfort in which our negro servants are forced habitually to live.","The master's irresponsible power has no such bound.","The most intense curiosity and excitement prevailed, and though the weather was uncertain, enormous masses of densely packed people lined the road, shouting and waving hats and handkerchiefs as we flew by them.","The vast concourse of people who had assembled to witness the triumphant arrival of the successful travellers was of the lowest orders of mechanics and artisans, among whom great distress and a dangerous spirit of discontent with the government at that time prevailed.","The white man's blood and bones have begotten this bronze race, and bequeathed to it in some degree qualities, tendencies, capabilities, such as are the inheritance of the highest order of human animals.","Yesterday morning I amused myself with an exercise of a talent I once possessed, but have so neglected that my performance might almost be called an experiment. I cut out a dress for one of the women.","Yet thousands of slaves throughout the southern states are thus handed over by the masters who own them to masters who do not; and it does not require much demonstration to prove that their estate is not always the more gracious.","Simplicity is a great element of good breeding.","I want to do everything in the world that can be done."],"Fantasia Barrino":["I feel like a good mom. I'm a strong woman now... Don't look down on me. Pray for me because I'm trying.","Have a little faith. Don't give up.","I always say you've only got one life to live, and you're not promised a tomorrow. So, you might as well just have a good time with it.","I want to do all types of music, music for all people. I want my music to be encouraging, to help people.","My lips are big, but my talent is bigger.","I like to play dress up, I'm in love with fashion.","I'm very soulful. I grew up singing in church. When I sing a song, I like to feel what I'm singing.","I've been wanting to sing for a long time. I've been singing all my life, and I've tried different record companies, but it seemed like - it was such a struggle and so hard to get out there. So, I said, 'I'm gonna go on American Idol and see how far it takes me.'","When I'm out on the stage, it gives me this rush and anything that's on my mind and everything I'm going through is forgotten about.","I been through some things but I worked hard to get to where I'm at.","I caught a lot of flak for being a young mama.","'Cause when I had my child, people tried to make me feel like life was over for me, and I started to believe that.","You've got to make it a good example for those kids regardless of how much you mess up.","It's always good when you can bring two artists together who are totally different.","I want people to just to see, all you got to do is have a little faith.","I seemed so different from other kids; I grew up in church and felt a connection with God, and a lot of kids my age really didn't understand that.","When I realized I was having trouble reading, I was too embarrassed to ask for help. Some teachers believed in me, but I just wasn't focused on school - I was into the music and trying to please my dad.","I wanted people to see me, to change their minds about me.","I want to still be singing at 70 years old. I want to be open to the dreams I haven't even dreamed up.","I've never been in a competition before, and I said I'm going to go. I think - I just love to sing.","I think my purpose was just to get out and sing. I love to sing. I wasn't even in it for the - you know, the prize. I was, like, 'Hey, man, I'm going to sing.'","I've been singing in church since I was little; my grandmother is a pastor.","I want real love.","When I was a child, I used to dream about being onstage in front of thousands of people, and it happened. It's not about the fame; it's about people being touched.","You can't tell me that dreams don't come true. My life is proof that they do.","God didn't give up on me. I am somebody in God's eyes... Let me be a prime example of how I've been through the storm and the rain, and I made it over.","I didn't want to be the type of mother where my child came to me, and I can't even help her with her homework.","I stopped going to church for awhile.","I wanted to be like some of the other young ladies that were in my school. I used to get picked on in church. Nobody wants to hang out with me. I want to hang out with the cool girls, and I started to take the wrong turn and do things I knew wasn't right.","I never started out as an R&B singer. I grew up on all types of music - jazz, rock, pop, country, folk - and I wanted to bring that to my stage.","R. Kelly is different - music is always going through his brain. I remember we'd be having a conversation, and he'd choose a word I said and write a whole song to it.","I was very insecure growing up, and even though I'm not that girl anymore, I think that the passion, that not feeling pretty and being insecure, is where my soul came from. And from early childhood, I let it free onstage.","I wanted people to know that I've been through the rain. I've been broken into pieces; I had a daughter at such a young age. There were times people would say, 'That's it for her.' But that didn't happen.","People root for me in such a way that when they come to a show, the experience of not knowing what's about to happen is a great thing.","A lot of times, we get into relationships, and we go in, and we take our old ways. If we take that old baggage into something new, it will never work.","My main thing is family first. This industry can get you so caught up that you're so busy chasing, wanting to be number one and wanting to be the richest that you lose sight of what life really is about.","I'm a true country Southern girl that has always been built around family, cookouts and gatherings and being together on the holidays, singing together and laughing together. So whenever God opened doors for me to be able to travel the world and sing and do all the great things that I've done, I didn't want to lose that part so family first for me.","If you're gonna be my friend, come in and be strong. I can't cater to you; I can't always let you borrow, borrow, borrow if you can't give me nothing!","I always tell people, 'Stop coming to me and telling what people are saying about me.' I don't care anymore. I always get the people that come to me and say, 'Girl, I just want to tell you... ' and I'm like, 'Nope.'","You can't go into something good until you let go of all the bad stuff because you'll find yourself steady bringing up all the old in a new situation.","True story - I had index cards; I would write things on them and post them on the mirror in the bathroom. And I would speak it. Because you have to speak life. You have to speak what you want. You have to watch what you say because it's power in your tongue.","It's hard to be patient. It's hard to sit back and actually wait and allow everything - just let it be.","Everything in life is a fight. Everybody wants this microwavable life, and it doesn't work like that. I'm here to say, 'See what I went through? Look at me now.'","Working out started as something mental. It was a way to release and let some things go.","I love Pilates, yoga, and spinning.","I work out every day, sometimes twice a day."],"Faran Tahir":["We are all quick to point out all the differences but not as willing to accept what bonds us as humans.","I grew up with 'Star Trek,' so to get to do anything in it was fun for me.","When I read a script, if I feel it's written with the idea of just bashing other people, then I shy away from it. Sometimes it's some guy coming out with his own hatred, and I don't need to be a part of it.","Does Hollywood do movies about terrorism? Yeah. And why do they do that? Because it sells.","When you play a character, you get to see the world through their eyes. Whether it's a fictional world or a real world, you do get to see somebody else's point of view, whether he's a good guy or a bad guy.","Sometimes stereotyping happens not because of any nefarious reasons but rather because people don't know who you are or where you come from, so they go for the broad strokes about you, your culture, your faith, all that.","The box office has become global. I think that factors in to the question of how to portray different ethnicities and cultures.","I think you can do science fiction, but you have to ground it in some realism. People need to identify with the characters, with their plights and their issues."],"Fareed Zakaria":["The Berlin Wall wasn't the only barrier to fall after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. Traditional barriers to the flow of money, trade, people and ideas also fell.","The tallest building in the world is now in Dubai, the biggest factory in the world is in China, the largest oil refinery is in India, the largest investment fund in the world is in Abu Dhabi, the largest Ferris wheel in the world is in Singapore.","When you're failing, there's a very powerful incentive to put ideology aside and just do what seems to work.","If there is one lesson for U.S. foreign policy from the past 10 years, it is surely that military intervention can seem simple but is in fact a complex affair with the potential for unintended consequences.","Americans have so far put up with inequality because they felt they could change their status. They didn't mind others being rich, as long as they had a path to move up as well. The American Dream is all about social mobility in a sense - the idea that anyone can make it.","What we see today is an American economy that has boomed because of policies and developments of the 1950s and '60s: the interstate-highway system, massive funding for science and technology, a public-education system that was the envy of the world and generous immigration policies.","In a very weak economy, when you say 'cut government spending,' what you mean is you're laying off school teachers and you're de-funding various programs that put money into the economy. This means you have more unemployed people that then draw unemployment benefits and don't pay taxes.","The great drama of Russian history has been between its state and society. Put simply, Russia has always had too much state and not enough society.","Street protests in Saudi Arabia might warm our hearts, but they could easily lead to $250 a barrel oil and a global recession.","I think that liberals need to grow up.","I am an American, not by accident of birth but by choice. I voted with my feet and became an American because I love this country and think it is exceptional.","It's not possible for two countries to be the leading dominant political power at the same time.","It is absolutely clear that government plays a key role, as a catalyst, in promoting long-run growth.","The United States is going to be a rich country, it is going to be prosperous, but it is not going to be able to take the lead in the next phase of global economic development.","One of the great dilemmas for America will be that American companies will do very well while American workers might not.","Things happening around the world are affecting you and me.","Alaska itself is an unusual state.","I grew up in Mumbai.","But as the arms-control scholar Thomas Schelling once noted, two things are very expensive in international life: promises when they succeed and threats when they fail.","In the 1990s, we were certain that Saddam Hussein had a nuclear arsenal. In fact, his factories could barely make soap.","In a world awash in debt, power shifts to creditors.","America's growth historically has been fueled mostly by investment, education, productivity, innovation and immigration. The one thing that doesn't seem to have anything to do with America's growth rate is a brutal work schedule.","I very much want to be in the business of creating content, of doing stories all over the world rather than figuring out what the business model is for 'Newsweek' on the iPad, although that's very important work as well.","What happens in the media is the cult of personality. The brands who have been forced to cut their staff have been forced to take on the brands of journalists.","My friends all say I'm going to be Secretary of State. But I don't see how that would be much different from the job I have now.","I grew up in this world where everything seemed possible.","Culture follows power.","Whenever someone says the word community, I want to reach for an oxygen mask.","If a senator calls me up and asks me what should we do in Iraq, I'm happy to talk to him.","If we didn't have the rest of the world growing, the United States economy would be in much worse shape than it is today.","Politics and power is a realm of relative influence.","I'd be kidding if I said that I predicted the financial collapse.","Whenever societies do well, they believe that there is something in their cultural DNA that made it happen.","The technological revolution at home makes it much easier for computers to do our work.","It hasn't been easy to find American citizens who are willing to pick fruit in 110 degree weather.","There is a huge crisis of employment in America, in the Western world in general.","One of the things that has been very difficult in Libya is the sense of uncertainty - the sense that they haven't actually finished the revolution, that there was still a great deal of uncertainty. That uncertainty has made Libya harder for business in terms of oil and other things as well.","The situation in Syria is quite different from Libya.","Having your fiscal house in order and having a more manageable macro-economic future is going to be very useful in creating growth.","The markets are much more interested in America's long-term trajectory than they are in feeling that there is an acute short-term crisis.","If you go to India the roads are being built almost entirely with private sector money and by the private sector. If you look at many, many countries in Europe that's how they're doing it.","There is very strong historical data that suggests the way societies grow is by making large, long-term investments.","I don't want to paint a picture of total gloom and doom.","The one show that I will continue to be a guest on is 'The Daily Show' with Jon Stewart, if he'll have me. It's not competitive with CNN and it's too much fun.","During the Cold War, we were interested because we were scared that Russia and the United States were going to go to war. We were scared that Russia was going to take over the world. Every country became a battleground.","You know, when the cost of capital goes down, when credit becomes cheap, people start taking greater and greater risks.","The Chinese economy's still not that much of a consumer economy.","The American consumer, even today, the weight of the American consumer in the global economy is China plus India doubled. So, it's tough to replace that.","The world is changing very profoundly.","I should not be judged by a standard that's not applied to everyone else.","I think it is quite untrue that it is standard journalistic practice to name the interviewer when quoting from an interview.","American influence is not what it used to be.","I'm largely in favor of financial reform.","I enjoy writing but I much prefer the experience of having written.","The Web forces me to be disciplined and not to waste time - but before the Web was invented, there were plenty of opportunities to do that anyway.","Iran is a country of 80 million people, educated and dynamic. It sits astride a crucial part of the world. It cannot be sanctioned and pressed down forever. It is the last great civilization to sit outside the global order.","Conservatives used to believe in confronting hard truths, not succumbing to comforting fairy tales. Some still do.","CNN is getting smarter, and you can feel it in the stories, you can feel it in the depth with which they're covered, the kinds of people in terms of guests who are brought on air, the way in which issues are discussed.","The people who watch Fox are not going to watch CNN. You know, let's be honest.","The American dream seems to be thriving in Europe not at home."],"Farley Mowat":["Without a function, we cease to be. So, I will write till I die.","We're under some gross misconception that we're a good species, going somewhere important, and that at the last minute we'll correct our errors and God will smile on us. It's delusion.","I write better in Cape Breton... too many people around in Ontario. Down there I meet all sorts of non-human people, but they don't bother me, and I don't feel I have to apologize on behalf of my species quite so often.","I write every day. I'm always in the process of writing my last book, until the next one."],"Farnaz Fassihi":["I have lucky boots for military embeds, a lucky scarf for road trips, a lucky handbag, and lucky days of the week.

So, I got to see the before and after of Iraq, basically, before and after the war.","Almost immediately, I remember right when Tikrit even fell, a few days after Baghdad fell, there was talks of insurgency, there was talks of jihad and of resisting the American occupiers, and slowly this turned into an organized movement.","I had several near death experiences or very, you know, close calls, if you may, in Iraq. You know, there was an incident where I was nearly kidnapped."],"Farooq Abdullah":["I should learn the language of a politician - give away as little and keep the rest to yourself. Not lie, I just want to be more guarded.","I can't hide things from my Maker, so it is better to be honest.","I trust people too much, and the other tragedy is I can't say no.","I want to become foreign minister of India one day and then President of India."],"Farrah Abraham":["I really embrace everything about my daughter.","I hope that others can turn their negative thoughts into positive thoughts and improve their own lives.","I get really upset when I'm around liars.","I've learned a lot from counseling and talking about the mistakes that I've made; I've understood why I made them.","I'm blessed with good genes, but I also love to look my best self.","Women should have equal rights to men, every day.","Children already ignore others and take time on their own, and I think that is something adults should refer back to as they deal with the everyday hustle of the world.","I was more of, like, into butterflies, insects, playing out in the yard, planting flowers. I was really into plants.","I do not associate with and I do not speak back to negativity.","My daughter knows she is loved. My daughter knows she has a mom, and I'm there, and I'm not worried about anything of what everyone else is worried about.","It is incredible how important doctors are to our society and how they help individuals live up to their full potential in life. I hope to inspire and help others fulfill their best selves as I do my best to become the top doctor in the nation in my future.","My grandma was a nurse, and she helped a lot of transgender clients, so growing up, I was very aware of that, and my family and I have always been very supportive of people going through this.","Even though I'm already successful and have a career, it is always good to have your eggs in more than one basket.","A lot of people are liars who I work with; that's a shame.","Some people don't have the right surroundings to help get them through an experimental time or a tough time.","By no means do we think, 'Oh, it's cool to be a teen mom.' I definitely don't think that it's cool.","When you go through the death of somebody who you care about, and taking on moving, bills, and a daughter, it makes you feel older. You learn a lot about life.","Oh, I definitely feel that women are equal to men. No doubt about that.","I'm pretty feminine.","I'm just pretty proud of myself.","I guess I'm a passionate person.","I think Trump's gonna be a great president. And Hillary's a great woman too.","I'm a business person.","I'm really not into black guys. I think that's more of a Kardashian thing. God bless them.","I have a lot of passion and experience with aesthetic surgery and look forward to helping men and women all over the world.","I was assaulted twice by Aisleyne Horgan Wallace and Janice Dickinson.","I'll just let people think what they would like to think, and that's fine, because it really doesn't infringe upon my life.","I definitely have my own brand, and so I never, ever envision myself with anyone else's lips.","I think I'm pretty confident, and I know I'm different than everyone else, so I'm going to do what's me.","I can't speak for everyone, but I know that I definitely don't want to be a consistent plastic surgery, cosmetic kind of scenario. I don't like going to the hospital. I don't want to put myself through pain. So I'm very limited; I know what I need, and then I call it a day.","There's bigger things to worry about than makeup.","When your kids are 5 or 6, they already start playing with makeup. And I was the only mother in freakin' elementary school getting called in to deal with makeup on her daughter.","I think some people are mentally unstable, and I don't think I should be around them.","If my daughter says she doesn't like something, I don't do it. It's up to Sophia.","I'm just about social justice. Amen to women like me!","I've hated my nose since I was 13.","I think my daughter looks beautiful regardless if she's losing her baby teeth or if she's having a bad hair day.","I think there's different parenting styles.","Not everyone's a perfect parent, but we do learn, and we grow from that. I'm not trying to be harsh on my family because it does make them sad to think back about how they used to be and some of their choices.","My parents got put into jail, both my mom and my dad.","My family and I have such a different dynamic now. We've talked through a lot of our abuse.","A lot of my girlfriends are on Snapchat, and they were being scandalous with what they were showing on there. I keep it pretty simple. I give updates and share things.","I do like bikinis. I have a good body.","I'm personally bored with all the hate and have a wonderful, healthy life with my daughter.","'In the Making' reveals the truth about 'being in the limelight' as a young celebrity.","When it's my time to go, I'll go, but the only time that's going to be for 'Teen Mom' is when the network takes it off the air.","If I'm ever concerned about something, I'll have security deal with it.","I don't ever want my daughter growing up questioning who she is or her choices. I want her to be a strong, happy individual.","I think everyone should - can share whatever they wish when their heart is touched and they want to spread more positivity rather than segregation and separation in this world.","We embrace all of our friends from every background.","I definitely am done with as much drama as I can be done with. I don't think it helps me with any of my business endeavors or the things that I'm excited about.","I just really love business.","I always vote. If I have the right, I'm going to vote.","Nothing I have ever done has made my future worse, my parents' life worse, my daughter's life worse.","I'm just thankful that I continue to do therapy because it makes the world a better place.","I actually just keep things very professional.

He is really not my type at all."],"Farrah Fawcett":["My number one goal is to love, support and be there for my son.","God gave women intuition and femininity. Used properly, the combination easily jumbles the brain of any man I've ever met.","The reason that the all-American boy prefers beauty to brains is that he can see better than he can think.","To be rude to someone is not my nature.","Everything has positive and negative consequences.","In the face of excruciating pain and uncertainty, I never lost hope, and it never occurred to me to stop fighting - not ever.","I became famous almost before I had a craft.","This experience has also humbled me by giving me a true understanding of what millions of others face each day in their own fight against cancer.","You have to eventually grow up and take control of your life, which is very hard to do.","Have I been wiretapped? Yes. But who they said wiretapped me was incorrect.","I am proud of what I have got and I need an audience.","I'm shy. I can go on a trip for days and not go because I won't sit on a toilet seat on a plane. I'm certainly not going to go on somebody's lawn. Could you imagine, in a cocktail dress?","It's still going on. I guess it will be until Redmond quits, dies or is jailed.","When you do bad things, bad things happen to you.","Marriages that last are with people who do not live in Los Angeles.","I don't think an actor ever wants to establish an image. That certainly hurt me, and yet that is also what made me successful and eventually able to do more challenging roles.","I'm a private person. I'm shy about people knowing things.","It would almost be sinful to say that I regretted doing 'Charlie's Angels' because it did so much for my career.","I was terrified of getting the chemo. It's not pleasant. And the radiation is not pleasant.","I'm holding onto the hope that there is some reason that I got cancer and there is something - that may not be very clear to me right now - but that I will do.","I find that, for me, personally - and this is in everyday life - if I'm not growing, if I can't be stimulated in a conversation, then I am bored. And I'm not good when I'm bored.","I think that when you're kind of just shoved out there and you have to be tough and you're facing tough people and people are saying bad things about you, that all of a sudden, you have to become a little less sweet.","You know what I would love? I would love to be one of those actresses who can come out with a film or come out with a new commercial without the world knowing about it.","I would rather make feature movies because, let's face it, you take more time. You take seven days to do a show, and you take three or four months to do a movie."],"Fat Joe":["I love Lil Wayne; that's like my little brother. He's just the coolest dude on Earth.","I was really from the streets, and I really did hustle in a major way. When I got my record deal, I left the streets alone as far as hustling. I never, ever hustled again. I said, 'I'm gonna change my life, I'm going legit. This is where I'm at.'","I think I'll die underrated, but it's alright, man.","As long as you get your education and you stay focused, you can do anything.","What I can tell you is that for Puerto Rico being such a small island, it has culturally impacted the entire world.","Culturally, the arts of Puerto Rico is really unmatched by any other island.","My coldest days, my darkest days, ain't no sun out, all I got is my fans. They the only people I ride for. Believe it or not, if you're a real Fat Joe fan, a Terror Squad fan, I do it for ya'll.","Envision what the end result is supposed to be... what do you want to be when you grow up? Where do you see yourself? Once we identify what the painting on the wall is, it is so much easier to bring in the right colors, canvas and brushes to paint that picture.","Being that I always perform, I started working out with a trainer to get that endurance and stamina. Now, I guess you could call me a gym rat.","See, me, I don't run away. During my successes or my failures, I put it on me.","Everything has to evolve. Music has to go somewhere. That's what keeps it fresh.","Never get involved with a business that you can't really be hands-on - that if your employees quit, you can't run yourself. If I can't cut hair, why open a barbershop?","When I first started, I thought I was wack. Lyrically, I thought I was wack. The thing I had over everybody was that I was the realest rapper.","I love to eat. If I could eat everything in the world and still be healthy or wouldn't catch a heart attack or stroke, I'd eat everything. I just can't. So I got to watch my health and take care of my family.","I don't rate Heat fans like I rate Knicks fans. We are true basketball fans. No matter what - rain, sleet or snow, or even if we don't make it to the playoffs for 10 years - the Garden stands are still full.","When I introduce you to somebody, his name is Big Pun. When I introduce you to somebody, his name is DJ Khaled. When I introduce you to an artist, her name is Remy Ma. If I introduce you to somebody, it's Cool and Dre or Scott Storch - people who change the face of the game.","DJ Premier, this guy is like a god, a walking god. Guru, he put it down legendary.","To be slandered the way I get slandered is really uncalled for, but life goes on.","To have so many years in the rap industry and so many number one songs, and sold so many millions of records, introduced the world to people like Cool & Dre, DJ Khaled, Pitbull, Rick Ross, Trick Daddy, Remy Ma, Big Pun, Rico Love... I could go on and on. Having been able to influence the rap game for so long is very important to me.","We go after legacies because we just know that, sooner or later, people will understand what we bring to this culture and bring to the game.","All I know is stars and hits, you know what I mean? I don't just sign a guy because he has a hot record. I sign a guy because he's a star. He's a pillar of the community.","I have been Fat Joe since I was a kid. It's always been my name and always will be.","As a little kid, I watched hip hop get created. So it's an honour for me to represent the Bronx, the motherland of hip hop.","Man I got so many regrets. The biggest is that Eminem gave me so many demos - six different times he approached me, and I didn't sign him. Shame on me.","The hip hop industry is most likely owned by gays. I happen to think there's a gay mafia in hip hop. Not rappers - the editorial presidents of magazines, the PDs at radio stations, the people who give you awards at award shows.","I started out in the Apollo Theater. That's where I got my start. I won Amateur Night four weeks in a row.","Before I was rapping, I was always around the rap game, even though I was in the streets. I would be at all the parties and all the events, and I was pretty hard to miss. I was one of the few Spanish cats sitting there with jewelry on, Dapper Dan suits. It was pretty hard to miss me.","If you really analyze my music, there is a lot of violence in my music because the Bronx, at the era and time I was coming up, was almost equivalent to how a 'Braveheart' or 'Gladiator' movie would be.","Fat Joe ain't out here trying to battle-rap everybody in the world. That's not what I'm about.","Food is like a legal drug. You can take 50 cents and walk into the store and buy a Twinkie and get high. And it's killing people.","I was a diabetic for 16 years, since I was 14. Being that I lost weight, no more diabetes. You don't have to lose your eyesight, cut off your toes, have a stroke, get kidney failure. You just have to lose weight - you know - for most of the diabetes.","I never lose touch. If you let me tell it, I'll tell you I never got my just due and my respect for being one of the greats in hip-hop, and because of that, the fire never burned out. There's more and more of a need for me to succeed or take the legacy a step further, and that's what it is.","Pun was just a natural-born genius with music, and he basically taught me so many tricks on how to make better music, even though I was the one that discovered him. He was so far advanced than me; he taught me a lot.","Chances are if I am the one to cosign people, they will become a big part of the industry.","The biggest misconception in the hip-hop industry is that people are only focused on the money. We should just be happy for everybody that is working in the hip-hop culture.","Once you achieve a level of success... you learn, something tells you, 'Man this ain't even for you.' You got to share with the people. You got to inspire the people.","I'm known to be hands on 100%. I don't know any other way to be than a leader by example.","When I came up in hip hop, there was no such thing as a Puerto Rican rapper doing hip hop for many mainstream people, so I was the ship, the captain, and the crew.","Talking to people from the heart matters, and it's unfortunately something brands have forgotten about. Celebrity endorsement deals try to gain recognition for brands, but at their core, what matters is if the celebrity truly backs the brand.","If you gay, you gay. Like, that's your preference, you know?","Mike Bibby's my brother.","There's millions of gay people in the world. In 2011, you've got to hide that you're gay? Like, you know what I'm saying? Like, be real.","I ain't here to tell nobody what's right or what's wrong.","Mister Cee's a legend, man.","I come from nothing, and growing up, I really didn't have many people to inspire me, at least no good people to inspire me.","Allen Iverson was the Tupac of basketball; he was a true revolutionary.","J. R. Smith's incredible, man, just incredible off the bench.","I would love to coach. I'm not saying I'm qualified to do it in the N.B.A., but I would love to try.","I've failed once or twice real big, independent.","MTV shows me love.","We're in the same ghettos, same inner cities, and we're suffering from the same problems. Every problem the blacks have, the Latinos have.","There's two systems of health care: the one for the rich that's really good, then there's the one for the inner city, where they leave ladies in the emergency room unattended for 24 hours until they drop dead.","I'm a huge fan of the Clintons. I love Hillary; I love Bill.","I don't think the Republicans care much about minorities.","I ain't no Kennedy, I ain't no Diddy Combs, I ain't no Jay Z, I ain't got it like them.","I'm just a human being. I'm from the projects, too.","It feels as if I never get my just due.","Whenever I come out with a hit record, they'll say, 'Ah, that's because of R. Kelly. Oh, it's because of Ashanti. Oh, he's lucky.'","I make hit records. I make hit records to motivate the people.","I could battle rap forever, but it's a joke to me.","Every ghetto you go to, Latinos and blacks are the two people that are together. We don't look at each other in any different way, like 'He's black; I'm Latino.' I look at us as one.","Minorities have been hustling backwards from check to check.","As U.S. citizens, Puerto Rico has paid their part.","I love the quality of TIDAL. I appreciate what they're trying to do and what they're trying to accomplish.","It's hard to have a boom-bap hip hop record that goes No. 1 in the country.","I make hits.","I'm not just a rapper. I'm a child educator.","Biggie has been the logo for success, the logo for doing it big - from popping champagne, the ladies, the fashion.","For artists, the majority of the money we make comes from us being on the road and touring.","I love owning my masters.","During my successes or my failures, I put it on me.","There are 3.5 million Americans in Puerto Rico. So, just like we're quick to go everywhere else and help, we expect that same of America for Puerto Rico. These are U.S. citizens!","Hector Lavoe is the greatest of all time. Marc Anthony is the second greatest.","I was scared to fly for a long time.","I beefed with 50 Cent for seven years.","Puerto Rico is a powerful island.","Latinos been a part of hip-hop culture and every other culture; we've been influential in every aspect of life.","We gotta be proud to be Latino. It's almost like we cheating because we're American and we live by American customs, but at the same time, we got that Latino culture. We cheating; we double dipping.","If you look at history, at the first time hip-hop was invented, there was a Latino right there. How they got erased, I don't know how that all came about.","I stay around the young boys in the studio; I want to learn from them, and at the same time, I have a lot to offer them.","Any time Khaled comes to your video, it just steps it up that much more. He's so fun; people love him.","I collaborate with Tidal because they're for the artists - the up and coming artists and the O.G.s in the game. It's like a home, the only place we have for the artists to find support.","There's no such thing as too much. If there's too much, then that's a great thing.","KRS One and LL Cool J are the biggest influences in my rap career, along with Heavy D.","I grew up pretty much with nothing.","Nobody in my family before me ever had anything.","We took Big Pun, a 700-lb Spanish guy, one of the greatest rappers ever, and made him a sex symbol. Women would wait on line to kiss him.","I always loved being fat, obviously. I'm Fat Joe.","If I could gain 1,000 pounds and be healthy, I would love to do that.","The biggest killer of people is food.","This world is too hard for me to leave my kids, without me supervising and being there for them.","All rappers exaggerate.","My parents are overweight, and I think the biggest problem we have in America is a lack of education. The place to start is with parents and teaching them to cook healthier.","I'm addicted to food, so if you bring the cake and stuff to my house, I might walk by and take a swipe of icing and keep it moving. So what happens is I try to not keep it around.","I think I weighed about 450/460 at my heaviest. That's huge! That's Fat Joe. And you know, I always took pride in being fat.","After the success of my first album and the success of 'Flow Joe' kind of faded, I was struggling to make some money and make ends meet.","I would bump A Tribe Called Quest in my car all day.","'Envy' was a bit of a challenge for me. It was smooth.","I realized, at a certain point, all my big people were dying. I couldn't see a clearer picture: what's the difference between me and him, of me being in a casket?","Donald Trump, you already know. We can't have that guy in office.","What I do like about Donald Trump is that he's not bought by the lobbyists. He put up his own money, funded his own campaign. That means he's nobody's puppet.","I wish we had more diversity.","There isn't a country I ain't touch in Africa. I just came back from South of France, I toured China, Japan, wherever you name, 60,000 people come out to see Fat Joe.","There's nothing I really believe about 50 Cent.","I was at a party New Year's Eve, and - no lie - at least 10 different people came up to me. One guy was like, 'I lost 30 pounds because of you.' So people just coming up to me. I don't know these people - random people.","I used to watch Oprah Winfrey, and whenever she used to lose weight, I used to be like, 'How's she losing it? What is she doing?' But it's all about education and knowledge, feeding yourself and knowing that too much carbs is what gets us fat.","The 'hood don't really wanna hear it, but you need brown rice, you need wheat bread, stuff like that.","It feels like we all win when Joe wins. People know the struggle, everything I had to overcome. People feel like that's them winning. If Joe could do it, they could do it.","I'm trying to get in where I fit in and take it to the next level.","I'm trying to work, be diverse and multi-talented.","When it's all said and done, I want to look back on my career and say I did numerous things.","The formula for a hit is saying what people want to hear.","We're just trying to make 'The Darkside' its own brand. It's Fat Joe, but it's 'The Darkside.' We come with 'Vol. 2,' make it crazier than 'Vol. 1.' By the time 'Vol. 3' come, we got a problem on our hands.","Who you know, 10 albums later, get better than he's ever been before? It's hard. To come from all this huge success like a 'What's Love,' and a 'Lean Back,' then take it back to the street with 'The Darkside.'","It feels like Gangstarr is the purest group in hip-hop. They was shooting videos on the beach in the winter when the water was ice. Razor-blade music.","Latinos finally have a genre of music that represents them, and they're supporting reggaeton in such huge numbers that people can't help but notice there's a revolution going on.","Your man Daddy Yankee, some black and white people who know what's going on in the 'hood and the clubs are supporting him and loving him. But he's speaking Spanish, and he's speaking directly to the Latino people, and the people who know the language really dig it.","Fat Joe is signed to Fat Joe. I have a distribution deal for my label. I'm independent. I'm very happy with that."],"Fatema Mernissi":["Morocco is such a beautiful place. It's incredibly beautiful. And also it is captivating place because for a writer, you feel that you make impact. I mean, when I write something in the press, the day after in the fish market, people will be discussing it.","The woman with dark hair, wide hips, and a few extra pounds has always been the essence of beauty in Morocco.","Consumerist ads brainwash us into individualist and egotistic self-love.","To understand the fanatic rejection of women's liberation in the Muslim world, one has to take into account the time factor. Most of us educated women have illiterate mothers. The conservative wave against women in the Muslim world is a defense mechanism against profound changes in both sex roles and the touchy subject of sexual identity.","If women's rights are a problem for some modern Muslim men, it is neither because of the Quran nor the Prophet, nor the Islamic tradition, but simply because those rights conflict with the interests of a male elite.","A woman can walk miles without making one single step forward. As a child born in a harem, I instinctively knew that to live is to open closed doors. To live is to look outside. To live is to step out. Life is trespassing.","Growing up, I was taught that a woman should lower her gaze so that men could never know her thoughts. The so-called modesty of Arab women is, in fact, a war tactic.","The modern Muslim state has never presented itself as secular. Muslim nationalist forces, trapped by a militant and colonialist West unable to share or export its humanism, were driven to build up a rampart, to entrench themselves within the past.","Sharia law does not exist in the Koran. It was created by man.","To me, the Quran is a research book.","Since all power from the seventh century on was only legitimated by religion, political forces and economic interests pushed for the fabrication of false traditions.","The Western man declares that in order to be beautiful, a woman must look 14 years old. If she dares to look 50, or worse, 60, she is beyond the pale. By putting the spotlight on the female child and framing her as the ideal of beauty, he condemns the mature woman to invisibility.","If there is one thing that the women and men of the late 20th century who have an awareness and enjoyment of history can be sure of, it is that Islam was not sent from Heaven to foster egotism and mediocrity.","One cannot understand what's happening to women in the Middle East if they don't realize that the mothers are a strong, progressive force. The mothers push the daughters to get out of the harem, to get the education, to achieve what they could not even dream of.","Someone else is going to read for me or go at my place to the mosque, and/or to tell me you shouldn't take anything from the West because the West is the enemy and so on. It is to me to decide. I am intelligent enough to be critical towards the West and take what I need and reject what is bad for me.","There has been a terrible hemorrhage of educated women to the West where they can flourish. I understand, but it is terrible. We must stay home.","You find in the Koran hundreds of verses to support women's rights, and perhaps four or five that do not.","So much of Islam is Judeo-Christianity. It's impossible to divorce them. Islam is 600 years after Christ. Thousands of years after Judaism. Christ, Moses, Abraham - they are all in the Koran.","Educated women armed with computers have defeated extremists by denying them a monopoly to define cultural identity and interpret religious texts. No extremist can say that women are inferior to men without being made a laughingstock on Al Jazeera. Islam insisted on equality between everyone.","There, they tell me to wear the veil. Here, they are telling me to put my hips in a little girl's skirt, and I am this lovely full woman. You've got this Ph.D. and you're worrying, 'Am I skinny enough?'","The Taliban is the Muslim version of the Salem witch trials.","No man could have accepted me because I am too rebellious. It would have been catastrophe. I am too into my own thing.","I go to the hamam and put henna on my skin and hair. Even when I go to New York, I let the shower run hot to create a steam hamam at my hotel. But when I finish with the bath, I put on expensive French creams.","In Morocco, for a woman to earn her own living is the essential concern.","Contrary to what many Westerners believe, Islam has a rich tradition of secular painting in spite of its ban on images. It is only in religious rituals that the use of pictorial representation is totally prohibited.","While Muslim men describe themselves as insecure in their harems, real or imagined, Westerners describe themselves as self-assured heroes with no fears of women. The tragic dimension so present in Muslim harems - fear of women and male self-doubt - is missing in the Western harem.","In Islamic societies, politicians can manipulate almost everything. But thus far, no fundamentalist leader has been able to convince his supporters to renounce Islam's central virtue - the principle of strict equality between human beings, regardless of sex, race, or creed.","The waves of religion based on terrorism in the 1990s are based on the tormented response of a mutilated Muslim society whose progressive forces have been savagely emasculated. Why on earth is the Arab world so hostile to women? Why can it not see women as a force for development?","In the 1920s, big names in the Arab world spoke of Scheherazade as an example for intellectuals fighting for their rights. She was a fighter for the right of free expression.","Now that Arab women are pouring into the streets by the million, men discover with dismay that they, not women, were the captives of the harem dream.","Women are builders of civil society. We are the ones who are going to build it. You know why? We have no choice. Either you shut up, and you are humiliated, or you do what I'm doing. You scream.","If, by chance, you were to meet me at the Casablanca airport or on a boat sailing from Tangiers, you would think me self-confident, but I am not. Even now, at my age, I am frightened when crossing borders because I am afraid of failing to understand strangers.","I was amazed to realize that for many Westerners, Scheherezade was considered a lovely but simple-minded entertainer, someone who relates innocuous tales and dresses fabulously. In our part of the world, Scheherezade is perceived as a courageous heroine and is one of our rare female mythological figures."],"Fatih Birol":["Renewable energy is no longer a niche fuel.","We have to use cars much more efficiently. We have to look at alternative technologies of cars such as biofuels or, even more importantly, electric cars.","When a person from a community goes and buys a car, he or she should have the incentive, financial incentive, to buy a more efficient, more environment-friendly car. This shouldn't be only left to the intention of the people. We cannot only rely on the ethics or the moral of the people.","Strong policies and innovation can make the difference for energy security, climate change, air quality, and universal access to modern energy services in parallel - in short, building a secure, affordable, sustainable energy system that is available to all.","Fossil fuel subsidies are a hand brake as we drive along the road to a sustainable energy future.","Renewables are critical in our fight against climate change.","Energy is a linchpin of economic prosperity, with energy security, reliability, and affordability key preconditions for sustainable growth.","The energy sector presents exceptional opportunities for governments and investors.","Governments have always played an important role in energy investment, but this role has been increasing due to both geography and technology.","Industry has to find a way. together with the governments, to find new modes, new modalities for transportation.","I have refused to buy a car for the reasons of sustainability.","I always thought that using more efficient energy sources, pushing the clean energy technologies such as renewable energies are important.","I think my biggest fear is having another global war which might have been a result of sharing the primary commodities in the world.","I believe there should be some financial incentives to make the right choice: to make them to buy the right car or not to buy a car but using public transport systems. I believe that these financial incentives are important.","When I look at the many energy-using sectors - such as businesses, households, electricity generators, the transportation sector - I see that the business sector is the one which uses the energy efficiency potential the highest, because they know that using energy more efficiently will also reduce their costs.","Humanity's future, to say nothing of its prosperity, will depend on how the world tackles two central energy challenges: securing reliable supplies of affordable energy and switching to efficient low-carbon energy.","I think, for OPEC, the main challenge is to have a price level which brings good profits to them, good incentives for the investments, but at the same time, to prevent prices going to very high levels.","The golden era for coal is over.","We should not only look at the short-term economic benefits of fossil fuels but also at the bad news for climate change. We should therefore not greet the fossil fuel age unconditionally.","We are considered to be a watchdog, the IEA, and a watchdog fulfils its task only if it barks. So I bark when I think there is a need for barking.","I love football, and I love my work.","We should not cling to crude down to the last drop - we should leave oil before it leaves us.","Tar sands are attractive, but like biofuels, they will never replace Middle East oil.","The developed, oil-consuming countries can do several things to ease the transition to the new energy order. One would be to boost vehicle efficiency.","India needs three things for its energy sector: investment, investment, and investment."],"Fatima Sana Shaikh":["Although I started off as a child artist, I left acting in between, as I felt that I was missing the fun of school days. But a little later, I became keen on acting again and started going for auditions.","I found it more challenging to act in a small scene, especially if it has no dialogue and if it is a close-up with only expressions.","I thought of learning cinematography, so I assisted a cinematographer for an ad.","I tried my hand at photography and worked with a studio for six months.","I had given up on acting because I would go for auditions every day, but nothing would happen.","Shah Rukh Khan is the love of my life. I love Aamir Khan also.","When such acting powerhouses take note of your work and express their appreciation, it is an overwhelming feeling. I could not believe it when Rishi ji tweeted. Then Amitji and Rekha ma'am sent handwritten letters, which I have read more than fifty times. 'Dangal' is a very special film for me, and these are my lifetime treasure.","I was very young during 'Chachi 420' and don't remember much now.","Kids and adults are treated differently on sets. Being a kid, you can get away with anything, and it looks cute. But as an adult, it's a whole new journey.","At one point, I had lost my confidence as an actor, and working again was tough. I started stammering due to lack of confidence. It took time, but things became better.","I faced many ups and downs, like any other actor: not getting through auditions or even worse - getting shortlisted and not being selected. Most actors go through the process.","I was not getting work, even after auditioning for films. So I started working in a studio as a photographer; I assisted a cinematographer for two ads. I was thinking that I will get into photography or cinematography or assist someone. But then the 'Dangal' offer came, and I was busy with the auditions.","When I was a kid, I didn't know how I got into acting.","When I was growing up, I thought I was getting bored of acting, so I left that. Then after a few years, I started missing it. I left my studies mid-way, and I used to give lots of auditions.","After so many years of rejection, I felt acting would have to become a hobby rather than a full-time profession.","I was about to give up acting when I got the call about being short-listed for 'Dangal.'","When you are doing a long scene, you have dialogue and interaction to narrate the character. But making sense out of facial expression and reacting is difficult. Having said that, I think such challenges are good for learning.","I have always been a movie buff and had no interest in any games and sports. I do not even watch cricket, which is one of the favourite games of most of my friends. However, I have become a wrestling fan after 'Dangal.'","I started auditioning but at times would feel depressed, as I would get shortlisted but never received the final call. Only when the commercials were released would I come to know that I was not selected.","I auditioned 5-6 times for 'Dangal.' I was just waiting for the final call, as there were about 15-16 girls who auditioned for the role."],"Fatima Siad":["I went from not knowing anything to becoming really curious and wanting to know and respecting people in the industry, realizing how hard they work. I will always be thankful for 'Top Model' for that.","I want to make a name for myself.","Now that I work as a professional model, I advise people to stay away from any television shows. It's a waste of your time; it's just entertainment. It's not the fashion that we now know.","I hear a lot of 'Top Model' girls say they are dismissed by clients because they recognize them, but it never happened to me.","Basically, I didn't know anything about fashion. I was very nerdy; I went to Bryn Mawr and never even noticed models when I was 21.","I want people to recognize me for the work I do now as a model, and not something I did three years ago.","The Broken Bow group is such a great family and seem like a group of tight-knit people. When I looked for a new label, I wanted to feel I could trust everybody. I wanted motivation to be at an all-time high."],"Fatos Nano":["I am hopeful that no one will forget what happened in Bosnia.","Organising free and fair elections is more important than the result itself.","Today in the era of globalization there is no such issue as borders between states of the same nation.","Kosovo is too close to Europe. It is not only close to Albania, it is close to Greece, Italy, Germany and Switzerland, where there are still many Kosovo refugees. Spontaneous reactions could multiply.","Milosevic will never stop, because he is fighting for personal power in Serbia. The only way to stop him is cutting the functioning of his war machine. He is spending $1.7 million a day on his war machine in Kosovo.","We are not only talking about waves of refugees coming to Greece, to Italy, and elsewhere. Destabilizing the Balkans means Lebanonization, and that means destabilizing all of Europe.","We have gone through everything as a nation - partition, dictatorship, and even anarchy.","If we follow the traditional way of thought, there will always be traditional enemies. Extremist circles from both sides will find causes to give rise to problems.","Albania does not feel alone. It is part of the Partnership for Peace structures in NATO, and it will do what it can within that.","Albania is at risk and we are living in difficult times.","Albania, Macedonia and Greece have managed to create a good partnership in the south of the Continent and are making progress in blocking the spread of the conflict. But any spillover could destroy this European-oriented partnership and create problems for the European Union countries themselves.","Albanians are a nation of freedom fighters who know something about living under oppression.","All sorts of artillery installations, rockets and tank units that are firing on civilians in Kosovo should be neutralized. If that means air strikes, then NATO should carry out air strikes.","If we didn't have the Albanian entrepreneurial spirit and financial support from the diaspora, this stupid political class would have destroyed the country by now.","Most of Albania considers this Government to be legitimate.","People didn't vote left or right in the election. They voted for putting an end to all the primitive political history.","That is why we wholeheartedly support the American-led effort to free the people of Iraq. And though we are a small country with a small military, we are proud to stand side by side with our allies in the fight to end the reign of terror in Baghdad.","Thus, neither my government nor myself, personally, are without ideals and responsibilities.","To rebuild this country will take a long time but we have the mandate and the people support us.","To see for themselves what the United States has been willing to undertake in the name of freedom. We should all visit Normandy. We should pay homage to those brave Americans who stormed ashore at Omaha Beach and gave their lives for the freedom of others."],"Fatou Bensouda":["I am a victim-oriented person. I like to see that the victims know that they have a voice.","We say that the ICC is targeting Africans, but all of the victims in our cases in Africa are African victims.","I am an African and I am very proud of that.","I think my track record speaks for myself... I have been endorsed by the African Union, but I am a prosecutor for 121 states parties and this is what I intend to be until the end of my mandate.","What offends me the most when I hear criticisms about this so-called Africa bias is how quick we are to focus on the words and propaganda of a few powerful, influential individuals, and to forget about the millions of anonymous people who suffer from their crimes.","I do not think that it is right for me to start giving opinions about the human rights situation of any country, including Gambia, except when those crimes translate into the crimes that I have to investigate."],"Fatty Arbuckle":["I don't believe there is any finer mission on Earth than just to make people laugh.","I shall produce nothing that will offend the proprieties, whether applied to children or grownups. My pictures are turned out with clean hands and, therefore, with a clear conscience which, like virtue, is its own reward.","I don't weigh a pound over one hundred and eighty and, what's more, I never did.","I've never used my weight to get a laugh. That is, used my size as the subject for humor. You never saw me stuck in a door-way or stuck in a chair.","How did I become a star? I don't know how it happened. When I look at my old pictures, I can't tell how it happened!"],"Fawad Khan":["Comfort and simplicity are two keys that I follow when it comes to fashion.","I think there comes a time when you start dropping expectations. Because the world doesn't owe you anything, and you don't owe the world anything in return. Things, feelings, are a very simple transaction. If you get it, be grateful. If you don't, be alright with it.","One must be prepared for some surprises in life - some things will work out your way, some won't. You just have to keep working and do things to the best of your ability.","Being trendy is alright, but clubbing all the trends in one look is a complete no.","Remember, the fit of your outfit can make or break your look. Ensure the fit is perfect, and you will be just fine.","Almost every story has a romantic angle to it.","I'd rather speak less because I don't consider myself a very intelligent person.","The motto of my life is, 'The best advice is no advice at all.'","Obviously, I'm not a man of steel in that people's words don't affect me. They might hurt me. But I am becoming immune to it as time goes by.","Whenever you move to a new atmosphere, the first few days are difficult. But I always felt that an actor needs to move out of his comfort zone and experience different working environments. And that's why I was looking at moving out of my own comfort zones and work with different kinds of people. It helps you grow as an actor.","I wanted to do animation, so for lack of available career counselling, took up Bachelor's in Computer Science, but managed to get only C grades.","I don't think anyone gets bored of being called good-looking. We are all vain in one way or another.","If I get into something, I get into it for the pure joy of it.","The time I'm truly happy is when I'm playing with my son. We just mentally connect. There's nothing more fulfilling than playtime with him.","I was born in Karachi, where my father used to work in the sales department of a pharmaceutical company. The nature of his job required him to travel, so we moved to Athens, Dubai, Saudi Arabia, and Riyadh and then went to Manchester during the Gulf War, moving back to Lahore closer to my father's retirement.","Being a part of the Bollywood industry gives you to the kind of exposure that's unimaginable. You also tap into this experience of technical expertise that this industry has been carrying along for several years. I didn't take part in the industry with an agenda in mind. If it happens, great.","I was 17 when I first acted on stage. I was a part of an Urdu adaptation of 'Spartacus' in the titular role.","A lot of men tend to mix a couple of fragrances and smell like a flower garden. Avoid!","If one wants to take a stand on something, one must be very educated about it.","If I'm going to talk about something, I need to be educated about it, and I need to have seen all the perspectives.","I feel - and this goes back to social media and freedom of speech - when you're on a public platform, and you put something out there in front of people who don't know you, they might just perceive it in a very different way altogether.","I've been penniless. I've had to struggle a bit. But now I enjoy thinking about that because it just makes me feel better about my achievements.","I do give interviews, but I am generally media-shy because I am an introvert by nature.","I may have played romantic roles, but each character has been different, with his own personality.","I have developed my own brand of acting, and fortunately, people like it.","Everyone has different interests, but instead of constructive learning, people generally tend to lean towards the negative... and I think social media has somehow given fuel to this kind of thinking.","Whatever appreciation I've got despite the limited work I have done has been great. People have been receptive, and I think it's a privilege to have earned this respect.","I have been in love with my wife since I was 17. She has always been my strongest support. Even when I didn't have this fame, she was there.","I am an immature person, and I am very lazy, too.","Fans are half of an artiste... without someone to appreciate him, an artiste is nothing.","As a musician, I have sung, composed, and played instruments, and a lesser-known fact is that I have composed 20-30 ad jingles as well.","I proudly represent Pakistan in India, and I hope that many more actors from there come and work here.","It's a great feeling to be admired... what can I say? It's a warm, gooey feeling.","I am the kind of person who likes taking one step at a time and raising the bar with each film.","I always consider myself as good as my last film. I tend to analyse my work very critically.","Growing up, I loved films like 'A Streetcar Named Desire' and 'On the Waterfront' and became a huge fan of Marlon Brando.","I'm an improvisational actor. I like to do my own thing. But once in a while, I think you should have the self-restraint to let someone else dictate the story.","I'm a quiet person. It's only when I am cued to talk that I talk. Otherwise, I'm reserved and a bit of a recluse.","I think I've managed to Forrest Gump my way though life.","I self-taught myself music at 19-20.","I don't think a multi-starrer or a solo film has anything to do with your choice of films. That is a bit of a primitive concept, really. Yes, you might want to keep a healthy balance, but that has more to do with the kind of roles you are playing.","The film's content is the king.","I choose films preferably based on content, and then I see the kind of team I have to work with.","I was part of a metal and rock band, and I performed in front of 3000 to 4000 people for many years. I was the loudest mouth up there on stage. We would be screaming, head-banging and mass venting. We would all vent our feelings together, which is ideal as compared to participating in political and social forums, and I never felt any restrictions.","I was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus Type 1.","I've adopted a diet that minimises high glycemic index carbs, coupled with lean protein sources and a mix of vegetables.","I think I lost too much weight during 'Khubsoorat.'","I want to play around with my looks. It's very boring to appear the same in all your films. Then people are looking not at the character but at the actor.","I am diabetic. So diet control is a pre-given for me.","With social media, I think it becomes a little more intrusive. People have more access to you. It's obviously very flattering, all the love and affection that you get, and then there's also the downside of it: sometimes things don't go your way.","I've been watching the 'Richard Pryor Show' for NBC made during the '70s. I'm a big fan of his work.","My kids are the light of my life.","Wherever the wind blows me, I'll go! My eventual goal is to have enough experience to produce something on my own.","I am the worst strategist ever.","I am always scared when I start something new. That hasn't changed.","From the time I've landed in India and wherever I've travelled, I've only experienced politeness and courtesy. There has been no hatred whatsoever. But I strongly feel every country has its formalities and rules that one has to abide by. I believe in respecting that, as it is in the best interests of everyone.","When I started doing television, I had no idea that people were watching it. But then things opened up for television in such a way that it's no more 'small' screen, as it is called.","Television is a big platform for actors, and so many actors have made it to films from there. And for me, too, it has been a great transition from the small screen to the big screen.","If there is place for music that I do in Bollywood, then I would surely like to sing a song in a Hindi film.","I stumbled into acting because a friend persuaded me to leave my 9 to 5 job and get into acting.","Bollywood was never on my to-do list. It just happened.","My wife is not insecure at all. She is one of the most sensible persons I know.","I believe you can do a lot even if you have a 15-minute part in a project.","In Bollywood, they've got their systems in place. It's a monster machine that's churning out, like, 400 films a year, consistently. They're able to efficiently process things.","My way of deciding whether a film is worth doing is if you can get through it all in the first read.","I've grown up watching cinema from around the world, and there are films that have scenes that are far steamier than what we are required to do on screen.","It's always a surprise to me when someone comes up to me and appreciates my work. I have a very limited body of work, so I feel very lucky to have gathered such an audience. I'm very thankful to them. I'm extremely grateful to them for showing such love.","During college, I didn't really have an interest in what I was studying. It was during college that I first stumbled into forming an underground band where I was the lead vocalist. I had always had an ear for music, but nothing more than that. And that good ear of mine led me to learn and play a lot of instruments while in college.","My father is pretty much a self-made man, and I am proud of that. He was born in Patiala and crossed the border from India to Pakistan when he was four.","I was an angry young man, a rebel without a cause, and I channeled my emotions into my music.","'Khoobsurat' was an eye-opener in many ways. Cinema is a colossal money-churning business in India, and working in that environment offered me quite an incredible learning experience.","You learn a lot about people when you live together.","The pressure is always there to do my best. I feel happy that I have an audience that looks forward to my next project. I have to make sure that I deliver.","I have the gift of the gab, can talk and perform, but so can others. I can only attribute it to the fact that somebody up there likes me: it's remote-controlled by God.","There's a strong bond I feel with my wife. It's not that I haven't come across other attractive people in my life, but no one else was willing to put up with me.","Old-world romance underlines my relationships, even with my son and the dog.","I can't even begin to describe what kind of a response 'Humsafar' got. Personally, I feel my other show, 'Zindagi Gulzar Hai,' was better, but it didn't match the success of 'Humsafar.'","Playing interesting characters makes me feel alive.","As any professional, you go where your work takes you.","There is no comparison between the life of a rock star and an actor. If I could now, I would be a rock star within a blink of an eye. So as far as music is concerned, yeah, I might just go back to it, but don't want to be unfair to it. It requires its proper time and space.","I've expanded my skill-set through a very limited number of projects and been very lucky with the outcomes most of the time.","As an individual, I've learnt a lot about life - some things that proved to be helpful and some things I wish I never knew.","There is so much to learn that I find the entire debate that Pakistani actors shouldn't work elsewhere senseless. By working in other countries, we're able to move out of our comfort zones, learn more, and bring that back to our own industry.","I like to discuss my condition publicly because if I, with this disability, am able to fulfill some of my ambitions, so can other diabetics.","I am not finicky at all regarding my appearance.","I am genuinely happy that other actors are entering the industry and gaining popularity. There are enough opportunities in the business for everybody.","Men are naturally barbarians, and that will remain forever. The passion, the love, and the lust is intensifying with time.","I'm married to the only woman I've loved, and I'm happy.","TV needs to be the medium for progress, not degeneration. There needs to be more programming for children. Plays need to become more responsible.","Television has the power to push for change. We need to push it in that direction.","I read the 'Kapoor & Sons' script in a half hour, forty five minutes. Not because I skimming through it... I read it like a book. By the end, I was blown away. I picked up the phone and said, 'This script is gold.'","I like playing characters in the real world.","I don't like it when people remain glued to their phones while talking, so I have no apps on mine.","I wish to direct someday.","I have done films only because my roles were good in them. It has got nothing to do with being associated with any particular camp.","I observe a lot, and I try to pick out what looks good on me. I like to keep it basic and simple. Never too flashy. Remember, whatever suits you is the best, and it doesn't necessarily have to be the trend or the rave of the season.","'Khoobsurat' introduced me to this huge, amazing audience so close to my home. In a lot of ways, it has changed my life, but the game keeps changing.","My character has to be alive. It can't be a mere prop, and it has to have a life of its own. I need to have that space to play around and the scope to interact with the people around me. That freedom would give me a lot of margin to improvise with.","I have always been the black sheep of the family. I am the middle child, with an older and a younger sister.","After I was cast in the acclaimed film 'Khuda Ke Liye,' I thought it would open up film avenues for me in Pakistan and, maybe, even internationally. When that didn't happen, I decided to use TV as a means of polishing my craft."],"Fawn Hall":["We shred every day.","And sometimes you have to go above the written law, I believe.","I felt uneasy, but sometimes, like I said before, I believed in Col. North and there was a very solid and very valid reason that he must have been doing this.","I think Col. North is first a U.S. citizen and he has the same rights as you yourself do, sir.","I did not know many of the details relevant to the Iran and contra initiatives.","I was very happy being a secretary. I loved working for the government. I was very happy with my life.","I wasn't interested in exploiting myself.","The press was all over to get a picture of me. It got to the point where they were all over my house, following me to work... Then Tom Brokaw and everybody else was doing stories, 'A star is born.'"],"Fawn M. Brodie":["A passion for politics stems usually from an insatiable need, either for power, or for friendship and adulation, or a combination of both.","Housework is a breeze. Cooking is a pleasant diversion. Putting up a retaining wall is a lark. But teaching is like climbing a mountain.","Show me a character whose life arouses my curiosity, and my flesh begins crawling with suspense."],"Fay Godwin":["Maybe black and white is the best medium for landscapes, I don't know.","And in fact I don't believe there is such a thing as a definitive picture of something. The land is a living, breathing thing and light changes its character every second of every day. That's why I love it so much.","I like photographs which leave something to the imagination.","The viewer must bring their own view to a photograph.","I hardly teach. It's more like a gathering of minds looking at one subject and learning from each other. I enjoy the process.","Look at lots of exhibitions and books, and don't get hung up on cameras and technical things. Photography is about images.","After Land I wanted to continue exploring the theme but I needed a new challenge so turned to colour. I explored Bradford and produced a series of urban landscapes that I liked, but because Land had made such an impact on the general public my colour work wasn't reviewed.","Born Berlin 1931, Germany, father a British diplomat, mother an American artist. Educated at various schools all over the world. 1958 Settled down to live in London. 1966 Became interested in photography through photographing my young children. No formal training.","But I was, and still am, an avid reader and so when I first started I chose to photograph many of the great writers in this country to try and earn a living.","I don't get wrapped up in technique and the like.","I had been working in colour for ten years or so and looked at digital and liked the possibilities it gave me.","I have always been a very keen walker, though, and I often took a camera with me on my walks.","I have always loved reading, so was interested in the literary world, and took many literary portraits.","I'm not faithful to one particular medium, and it's what I try to teach to people who work with me.","I've been working with the land for most of my life; walking it and photographing it. And I love it to bits.","It was 1966 by the time I started taking pictures seriously and books, newspapers and magazines of the time were full of great pictures that helped to inspire me.","What I loathe is the multi-national conglomerates who must take responsibility for the degradation and pollution of so much of our landscape with their factory farming and greed.","You can't expect to take a definitive image in half an hour. It takes days, often years."],"Fay Vincent":["This is a coup for commissioner Bud Selig. I'm surprised it's as good as it is.","Certainly toward the end of the season, you and I could be in a ballpark and they might say the crowd is 30,000, and we could look around and see that there was no more than 10,000.","The economics of baseball are the big problem. The big clubs make a lot of money and the little clubs don't.","It was a terrible day for baseball, it was a worse day for Congress.","I think it would have been a lot better for him to say, I did it and I'm sorry, McGwire was never one to show a lot of emotion on the field, not a player who sought attention and craved to be thought of as a nice guy.","It's tempting, because as one senator said to me, 'We know if we invite baseball down, we'll draw a crowd'.","I believe that, too, it's hard to believe that anybody could not believe that.","It's not in baseball's interest or the players' interest to be taking this stance. It's the people's game.","I can't be optimistic. I can be hopeful.","The final ballots represent players, managers, executives and builders who are top-tier candidates and worthy of review for consideration for election to the Hall of Fame."],"Fay Weldon":["Only one thing registers on the subconscious mind: repetitive application - practice. What you practice is what you manifest.","The desire for self-expression afflicts people when they feel there is something of themselves which is not getting through to the outside world.","Beauty is the first present nature gives to women and the first it takes away.","There's no such thing as old age, there is only sorrow.","No one could be more happy than a man who has never known affliction.","People give us credit only for what we ourselves believe.","I love acting. It is so much more real than life.","Men are irrelevant.","The greatest things are accomplished by individual people, not by committees or companies.","Young women especially have something invested in being nice people, and it's only when you have children that you realise you're not a nice person at all, but generally a selfish bully.","Nothing happens, and nothing happens, and then everything happens.","We shelter children for a time; we live side by side with men; and that is all. We owe them nothing, and are owed nothing. I think we owe our friends more, especially our female friends."],"Fay Wray":["When the picture was finished, they took me into the sound room and then I screamed more for about five minutes just steady screaming, and then they'd cut that in and add it.","When it was over my daughter said, 'Oh, I felt so sorry for him - he didn't want to hurt you, he liked you.' That was Victoria. When you visualize him up there on top of the Empire State Building, you do feel sorry for him.","I think to have done 'Titanic' would have been a tortuous experience altogether. I feel good about where my life is, now. I feel free and joyous and happy and more liberated than I have ever been.","I would say the secret is to be enthusiastic about everything that comes into your life. To care, to care about people. To be excited about everything that comes close to you. I love to read. And I love to write, mostly.","Sometimes I worked with just a background of a rock or a tree or black velvet, and just had to imagine the whole thing.","Cary Grant and I were doing a play in New York. He had a crush on me. Whenever we went to a party, he would always sit on the floor beside me. I thought that was kind of beautiful, like that's where he wanted to be.","My next book is Scene by Scene: as Seen by Fay Wray. It'll be about different incidents. Just my feelings about quite a few people. Attitudes. My thoughts about the universe and simple things like that.","Well, the Empire State was about 40' high in the studio. King Kong was a little model about 2' high, and the scenery that he worked in was in proportion to his size.","They were very considerate, I must say. Every time I felt I was about to slip out of these fingers and would yell for help, they'd let me down and re-organize things.","So I was asked to do horror film after horror film, a series of about five, after that, and some of those were a little too gruesome. I wasn't too comfortable all the time in those. I didn't really care for them.","My children didn't when they were little because I thought that they had to be of a certain age. I hoped they liked me well enough not to want to see me in that sort of a spot.","That was' one time when my technique absolutely deserted me, I must admit. There was a wax face that he had created himself to cover his own ugliness. I was in his clutches and I had to hit him in the face.","I don't know why Sinclair Lewis fell in love with me. He didn't get even the slightest response from me. But his letters were lovely. And the poems he wrote me were lovely. I used some of them in my book.","It was good for us, I suppose. Those kinds of times produce qualities in us that make us better for having had them. My parents were not getting along. My mother was quite intolerant of friendships that were being developed.","She wanted us to feel we were above everyone in the town. She really did tell us that we were related to Chief Justice John Marshall, and that may have been true. I never did bother to find out.","For the purposes of the play, it was perfect to be able to use that and the stresses and strains that there were. At the end of the play, the mother realizes the terrible things she had done.","I went to Washington to ask for a little residual payment for the people who had written films in the early, early days, people who never got any residuals on tapes or anything at all.","When we were making KONG, I went into the sound room and made an aria of horror sounds. I was in charge of it; there was no one there to listen to me. I was totally in charge of what I wanted to do.","The producers who wanted me to do it liked me and trusted me, and more than one scene was only one take, because I'd plan ahead what I thought would be appropriate for that scene-so one take was enough.","Actually, the camera was never overhead at any time. It was always a side view of me. Subsequently, after the picture was released, I saw some scenes from above and my clothes being pulled-and I think that was added later.","There were shots of Kong pulling at my clothes, but only in horizontal and never from above. Never from above.","Juan Tripp was a friend. Good name for an airline man, huh? Juan Tripp after another?","Paul Lucas had a particularly amusing accent, so I chuckled. That was terrible; I shouldn't have done that, but he took it too big. He got up and said he couldn't work with people who laughed at him!","He was just trying to tease me - I knew that later - but he said he'd have to leave because it wasn't fair to have anyone in the room who was going to make fun of what he had to say. He had a good sense of humor, really.","I thought I saw him for what he was-or what I thought he was. And he was talented, no doubt about that. But, he thought his talent was based on misery and that if he became happy it would just go. He believed that.","Cary Grant was wonderful to work with on stage. He would move downstage, so that as he looked at me the audience had to look at me, too. He knew a lot about the theater and how to move around. He was very secure.","Lillian Gish thought that there should be a cabinet position for the arts and I think she was right. I think she was right.","Crawford washed her hands a lot. She washed her arms all the way up past her elbows. She just couldn't get enough done in that direction. She was compulsive about being clean, clean, clean!","I think the studio gave me that series on purpose, because they knew perfectly well that Robert Riskin was ill and that I needed to go to work. They gave me that series to do.","It was so satisfying for me - a great reward, just to see it done well. And it was beautifully directed by my daughter Susan Riskin. Imagine, a play about my mother directed by my daughter?!","As far as advice, that will be in my next book, my next collection. I certainly never like to instruct anyone, but just say as I feel. That's the same as advice, isn't it?","There is a lot of strength and intelligence in Hollywood.","Only in your imagination can you revise."],"Faye Dunaway":["I feel like I'm a beginner in everything in life.","It's interesting as one grows older to keep in touch with the cutting edge.","I still have, I hope, a lot of years and there are still a lot of things I want to do.","God bless McNally, it's got some fantastic stuff in it, but it's no easy task to make a movie out of.","You just sort of let them go for a while, but it was time to have something done to my teeth. I'm glad. It's going to be good. Tom Cruise has braces now, too. I'm right in style.","I'm still the little southern girl from the wrong side of the tracks who really didn't feel like she belonged.","You are an athlete when you're onstage. You can't get tired.","Years are not important, my dear.","When you're younger they always try to get you to do every ninny role that's going.","Well, softness and femininity like yours people don't expect of me; so when they find me emotional and capable of real vulnerability, they're surprised.","So many people are called but few serve as actors, you know what I mean?","So Liam and movies are obviously big passions, and I read and write.","Since Star Wars, that film's success led to bigger budgets, more hardware, that the great movies like the ones I did, which were studio movies, are now independent movies. They range from half a million to several million, and a lot of those have very interesting roles.","My mother's passion for something more, to write a different destiny for a dirt-poor farmer's daughter, was to shape my entire life.","It's true, I did a lot of great movies, and I'm happy. It was what it was, and now I think all of that has fed into where I am now, and I think it has taught me a lot.","I've been working on this feature script for Master Class, a play by Terrence McNally that won a lot of Tonys.","I'm kind of a recluse.","I often say the last role I played that really touched me and where I was able to access what I really am was Bonnie, which is kind of sad when you think how early in my career that was.","I mean, I was always interested in people like Lenny Bruce, people who are breaking the old rules and making new ones.","Do you know what I'm working on now? My first feature as a director.","Work is a salvation. Work is how you connect with who you are, no matter how painful it might be.","All my life, I've been the kind of person who could shatter easily.","I'm a loner. I kind of like to be alone and do my work and, you know, be focused on my own things.","'Network' was formidable in the sense that I was playing a strong, avant-garde woman.","You can't be ashamed of the work you've done. You make a decision, and then you have to live with the consequences.","I didn't think my face was beautiful. I guess I found a lot wrong with it.","When I was discovered, everything happened like dominos. I don't know how to talk about it now because it's too mindblowing. It's so unreal, and yet it's real.","It's not age that makes a life. It's what you do with it.","I regret so much. I've made mistakes. I've hurt people. I've done things I'm not proud of. But on the other hand, that way lies madness, you know?","Once you reach a certain age, you realize that men aren't as important as you once thought they were.","The minute you start believing your own success, you're on the road to ruin.","When someone is successful, there's always a feeling that they were lucky. Luck plays a part, sure, but to be successful, you must have iron discipline. You must have energy and hunger and desire and honesty.","I sort of dropped the ball after 'Bonnie and Clyde.'","Acting is different from mental gymnastics. You try to discover as much about the character as you can, but a large area is mysterious.","For a long time, I couldn't cry on stage. I cried very rarely as a child.","I get angry when people push people around.","I always think I would like to have a partner in life, and I would - if I could find the right person, I think.","If you don't eat properly, it affects your energy level. You are an athlete when you're onstage. You can't get tired.","Unless you come to terms with your past... it haunts you, and you never leave it.","I like the Four Seasons. It's a nice hotel.","I am who I am and, you know, I've done the best I can with what I've been given.","I want to play real people. Real women. I want to be where the fun is - closer to humanity.","I think that somehow I got the notion that I had to be successful, to be the best in the world.","I was very determined. The straight-A girl. I wanted to succeed. Driven. Let's face it: very driven."],"Faye Marsay":["I've been lucky enough to sort of go over different mediums, different vibes and genres.","Football is my true love. I played with boys until I was 11 and then for a girls' club in Middlesbrough until I was 16.","We are a typical working class northern family, big into our football... no one in the family was into acting. But I remember seeing a panto when I was about six and thinking, 'Yeah... I wouldn't mind doing that.'","Nothing is impossible on 'Game of Thrones.'","I feel passionately that the opportunities I have had should be available to everyone.","I'm from a salt-of-the-earth, working-class, northern background. My dad's a steelworker and a firefighter, and my mum is a secretary for the NHS.","There were no theatre facilities at the comp that I went to, but I did have amazing teachers who never stopped encouraging me.","I think, with 'Pride,' I always knew that was something amazing because of the people who were in it and the story and the way it was written and who was directing. Anyone in that cast knew it was special.","I never expected that I'd be doing as many jobs as I did. I know everybody says that, but I thought I'd be sat in my pants waiting for someone to ring me. Then maybe within five years I might get something.","I constantly think I'll be found out any second. Some of the crazy stuff that goes through your head. Once you've moved on from the scene, that's it: it's going in the telly and there's nowt you can do about it! It's really scary.","Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and you like what you like. But I felt like with 'Pride,' certainly when it was released in America, there were certain things that went on with the marketing where I though we're pandering to whatever the vibe is of that area.","My grandad was a miner. My father, brother, and uncles all work in industry.","I'm from the north, so I'm anti-Thatcher.","Even though I have Twitter, I only use it to say, 'Oh, this is coming out.' I would never voice anything about me, really.","It's terrifying, social media. It terrifies me.","I just like playing people.","I just like doing my job.","I really loved making 'Love, Nina.' I was in every scene, which was amazing. Bloody hell, what a job!","I like that about London. It comes together when it needs to, and it has magic.","My feet are always on the ground. My family and friends make sure I stay there.","I worked in a restaurant and in a nightclub cloakroom.","It's part of the magic of 'Game of Thrones,' all the secrets."],"Faye Resnick":["Ever since it was announced that Ryan Murphy intended to produce 'The People v. O.J. Simpson,' I have been inundated with the question as to 'How do I feel about it?' All I can say is, for me, it was personally the most heartbreaking tragedy that altered my life forever.","Like most people, I shrink from exposing my innermost secrets and my most private and intimate actions.","I was raised thinking that the world would end in 1975 - that Armageddon would come when I was 18 years old.","I'm not an actress; I'm not a professional testifier.","I want nothing to do with O.J. Simpson. I want that name so far behind me, I want it out of my life."],"Faye Wattleton":["The only safe ship in a storm is leadership.","I do not make any apologies for my manner or personality. I come from a long line of very strong, black African-American women who neither bend nor bow. I haven't had very good modeling in submission.","The influence of one's parents is powerful and permanent.","Being a person who has had plastic surgery and goes to the gym five days a week to work my muscles up so they don't look atrophied as a 60-year-old, I don't disparage people who want to maintain their appearance. But what I don't want is a society that tells me I have to.","Affirmative action has been generally cast in terms of race. I think women themselves are not as cognizant of the role affirmative action has played in opening the doors for women.","My satisfaction comes from my commitment to advancing a better world.","One of the sad commentaries on the way women are viewed in our society is that we have to fit one category. I have never felt that I had to be in one category.","I have never believed in the impossible.","I was raised in a very sheltered, narrow environment.","My mother taught me a lot of things, but they had big presuppositions built in - like her expectation that I'd be a missionary nurse in a religious order.","'What can your kids teach you?' Well, I believe something different about kids. We don't own them, they have their own knowledge. From the start you have to make the choice to listen.","In 1985, I saw a tape of myself where my eyes were puffy. I looked very tired and bedraggled and not as youthful as I would like to have been.","The recognition of rights for women and minorities became a large part of my understanding of what this country is all about.","A woman who places a high priority on performance and excellence is seen as imperial. A man is seen as demanding and tough.","Many African-American men are incarcerated. And so African-American women do carry an enormous burden. And traditionally have carried a greater burden than perhaps their white counterparts.","We have a very long way to go to really penetrate the power structure. Until that happens, you will not see stability among the workforce, among women - in the workforce among women.","The deal is that women have entered the workforce, but they have not been relieved of the domestic responsibilities.","This is not a country that has had a tremendous sympathy for poor people, so I think that the notion that somehow we have slipped into an era in which poor people don't matter is not quite the way our history would define it.","My mother was from Mississippi, or is from 'Mississippi;' my father was from Alabama. He speaks about conditions in Mississippi and Alabama. They were really the poster children for the bad public laws that segregated, according to race, in our country."],"Fede Alvarez":["I always say that I am a big fan of films but I am an even bigger fan of the filmmaking craft.","If you think about it, you can have the best CGI, but you can always tell that it is CGI. Your brain can spot that is not real even though you think it looks cool. Your brain knows the truth, so you don't jump and you don't scream. It was very important for me to expose the audience to real elements.","As a storyteller, when you're writing a movie and when you're directing, you want to keep people entertained. That's the whole point, right? It has to be entertaining.","Only really good comedies and really good horror movies get a verbal response out of the audience. People will scream. People will laugh.","'The Omen,' 'The Exorcist,' those movies for me are the quintessential horror movies that still scare me as an adult.","PG-13 horror, I just don't watch that.","There are the horror fans that love the 'Evil Dead' because of the humor, but I'm sure it's not all of them. Not all horror fans love 'Evil Dead' because of the humor, at least not me.","Every day I spend in Hollywood, I start to realize how many films are made with no heart and no love. They just do it for the paycheck, and I cannot imagine making a film that way.","I'm inspired when I find out about something that I didn't know was a remake. An example is, of course, stuff like 'The Fly,' or 'The Thing,' or even 'The Blob.' For our generation, all those things, whether it was 'The Blob' or 'The Fly' or something else, we had no idea they were remakes.","Maybe because I'm a child of the '80s, but for me, a sequel is a story that follows the previous one, and sometimes if you haven't seen the original, then you don't understand the second one. Like 'Back to the Future 2.' If you haven't seen the first one, you're not going to get anything out of 'Back to the Future 2.'","In 'Clockwork Orange,' you're there with your eyes, watching all those things, your brain goes off, ahh, exposes you to so many things, and at the end of the day, it's just like a roller coaster. Why do you jump in a roller coaster? You want a thrill.","It doesn't matter the amount of gore, the amount of shocks that you can have in a movie if the movie's not entertaining, if the story's not entertaining.","A good story will keep you wondering about what's happening, what's going on, where does this go? Now it's going to go that way, now it's going to go that way. It has to do that. If it's predictable, it's just boring.","If you think about it, a lot of great horror films have bad sequels just because the market demands you to make the other one right away. Thank God no one in the 'Evil Dead' family thinks that way.","I'm a big fan of movies, but I'm a bigger fan of filmmaking itself. I fell in love with it when I was very young, and I have always loved to learn the craft, every aspect of it.","I love just about every aspect of the filmmaking except acting. I would never be able to do that, but the rest I really enjoy.","I'm pretty demanding with myself and my work, and I always put a lot of pressure on myself. I try to do the best job I can every time.","I watched 'Evil Dead' when I was 12. I was going through all the horror I could grab. I remember going to the video store and asking for something 'real.' And the guy gave me the 'Evil Dead' VHS. When you're 12, you're not supposed to see that.","There's a reason people use CGI: it's cheaper and faster. I hate that.","I have my pride. I'm a director. I'm not going to go and recreate some other director's vision.","A good horror movie - it doesn't matter how many comedy horror films there have been before. Doesn't matter how much you think it's going to be funny. A good horror movie will scare the hell out of you... the moment you sit down and you start being exposed to that story, it's going to freeze your blood.","As a director, there is nothing more fun than seeing an audience screaming and jumping. You are the ultimate puppet master, controlling the emotions of the audience.","In another life, I would love to be the art guy - a production designer or a maybe even a composer.","I thought that Hollywood was just for geniuses and that directors come from three generations of directors. I was worried that I was not up to the challenge of making a movie. Then realized that all a director has to do is know what he wants to do.","'Evil Dead' was such a big movie in my life. It's one of the few that I really remember when I watched it for the first time. I mean, I don't remember when I first saw 'The Empire Strikes Back,' and it's one of my favourite movies."],"Federica Mogherini":["A transition, by definition, means you start in one place and finish in another.","It's not diversity that is going to destroy us, but fear of diversity.","Without justice, the most heinous crimes go unpunished; victims are unable to obtain redress, and peace remains an elusive goal, since impunity generates more hatred, leading to acts of revenge and more suffering.","Jerusalem is not just a beautiful city: the challenge is to show that Jerusalem can be shared in peace and respect.","There have always been different opinions on some elements of our sanction policy. It will probably stay that way... What is important is that we keep this unity and decide all together.","The European Union is here to stay.","The European Union will continue to fully support multilateral global governance based on international law, human rights, and strong international institutions.","As it happens in relationships that are open and frank and based on mutual respect, you say things as you think them, and this doesn't mean that you don't work together in a constructive way.","There is a need for the European Union to use all potential we have on defense cooperation.","There are no regions in the world as reciprocally integrated as Latin America and the Caribbean, and Europe.","I'd be happy if, during my mandate, the Palestinian state existed.","Justice is one of the core elements towards reconciliation and sustainable peace.","Indeed, our British friends have decided to leave us - which is very sad for all of us - but life goes on, and the European Union as well goes on.","Moving from Rome to Brussels was hard.","Internal security implies also an external dimension, a defence capacity.","We want to engage in ever closer synergy with Latin American and Caribbean partners.","Our interests are indeed common European interests, and the only way to serve them is by common means. That is why all Europeans, and all E.U. member states, have a collective responsibility to strengthen our Union.","Anti-Semitism has not disappeared, and European Jews have too often come under attack.","Each new generation needs to commit again to the foundations of our peaceful coexistence.","Europe, Latin America, and the Caribbean share a cultural heritage based on centuries of common history. And what is more, we share the same values and world view. We believe in a world order that is based on cooperation, on regionalism, on multilateralism.","In international relations, you don't base your work on hope.","I think that it is becoming more and more clear that the European Union is an indispensable partner in some fields.","No country can become an E.U. member state if it introduces the death penalty.","In a changing global landscape, Europe will be more and more an indispensible power.","The E.U. intends to be one of the biggest humanitarian donors on the Syrian crisis.","In the wake of the United Kingdom's vote to 'Brexit' the E.U., we Europeans will indeed have to rethink how our Union works; but we know very well what we need to work for. We know what our principles, interests, and priorities are.","The E.U. needs a strategy that marries a shared vision to common action.","The E.U. can deliver on its citizens' needs and make its partnerships work only if we all act together - E.U. institutions and national governments, at all levels, united.","The European Union will never see America, or an American president, as a risk.","There are trends in our societies... that can lead to some political decisions in America and in Europe that can give some ground to the radicalization discourse.","It is not only the people of Gaza that can't afford having a fourth war - all the world cannot afford this.","E.U.-U.S. ties are deeper than any change in politics.","There is, and there will be, an increasing demand for a principled global security provider, for a superpower that believes in multilateralism and cooperation.","I think Jerusalem can be and should be the capital of two states.","We need a Palestinian state - that is the ultimate goal, and this is the position of all the European Union.","We do not interfere in U.S. politics... and Europeans expect that America does not interfere in European politics.","Our policy on the annexation of Crimea, which we consider illegal, will stay.","A relatively young woman is perceived as younger than a relatively young man.","My passion was reading newspapers - and I became curious, in particular, about Islam and the Arab world.","We need to restart political processes to end wars.","We Europeans have a long tradition of cultural and economic relationship with Iran.","There is nothing more worrisome to ISIS than cooperation between 'the West' and the Muslim world, for it defies the narrative of a clash of civilisations the group is trying to revive.","An alliance of civilisations can be our most powerful weapon in the fight against terror.","Too often, when Europeans talked of trans-Atlantic ties, we focused on the North Atlantic only.","Peace between Israel and Palestine is a top priority for the European Union, and it will remain a top priority in our political agenda.","Too many times, the international community has not prepared the post-conflict period in time.","As long as a member state is a member state, there are no negotiations bilaterally on any trade agreement with third parties.","The European Union and its member states continue and will continue, as the nuclear deal is implemented, to have open channels with Iran.","The effect of sanctions on the Russian economy are clear to everybody, first to the Russians and to the Russian leadership, and the surroundings of the Russian leadership, the circle that is close to the Russian political leadership.","I will be very involved in Ukraine.","This can sound as something naive. But if we are together in this union, it's because we choose to be one in many things. That's what makes the European Union experience so challenging and also a model. Why did we do this choice? Because we see that we share a common interest and common values.","We have to be serious and consistent if we believe the European Union makes sense. I believe it makes sense.","A free trade agreement can be a win-win for E.U. and India.","A stronger E.U. of defence makes NATO stronger.","Global issues require common responses: Only together we can create the conditions to defeat Daesh and al Qaeda, block channels for terrorist financing, tackle foreign terrorist fighters.","We will stand by the Paris climate deal.","It's not for me or another European to speak about domestic political choices or decisions in the U.S.","Maybe 'America first' means also that you have to deal with America first.","I'm convinced the fall of Aleppo will not end the war.","The European Union remains a staunch supporter of the ICC and is committed to full co-operation on the prevention of serious crimes falling under the jurisdiction of the Court.","We need to have Turkey respect democracy, human rights, and fundamental freedoms.","The European way is also the United Nations' way. And we believe in the U.N. because we believe in the same principles, in the same values, and our communities are built upon the same fundamental ideals.","The European vision is the United Nations' vision.","Our expectation is that the Russian Federation does its part to protect its own citizens in full respect of human rights principles."],"Federica Montseny":["The love of liberty and the sense of human dignity are the basic elements of the Anarchist creed.","Men are as we have always known them, neither better nor worse from the hearts of rogues there springs a latent honesty, from the depths of honest men there emerges a brutish appetite - a thirst for extermination, a desire for blood.","Authority is something from which we are constantly subtracting, of which there remains always a residue, and which we attempt to make smaller and smaller.","But we must create in each person a sense of responsibility in order that each one of us can have the right to enjoy all his rights.","Prostitution presents a moral, economic and social problem that cannot be resolved juridically.","We have confirmed something we only knew in theory, namely that revolution, in which uncontrolled and uncontrollable forces operate imperiously, is blind and destructive, grandiose and cruel.","We tried many times before to speed on the social revolution in Spain; attempted to stir up the feelings of the people and to raise the banner of Libertarian Communism.","I wish to say that we Anarchists have never changed our position. We are Anarchists as of old and still pursue the same ideals.","Our constancy, same might call it our madness, was necessary to wear down the oppressive forces of the old democracy which, in Spain, was a hundred years behind the times.","The struggle is so great that the triumph over fascism alone is worth the sacrifice of our lives.","There are Anarchists in other parts of the world who are unable to, comprehend the position of the Spanish Anarchists. I do not pretend to censor these Anarchists.","If all our comrades of Europe, America and other countries, who do not understand what we are doing to Spanish Anarchism, would come to Spain, we could then see how they would react.","And we will accept the creation of the Iberian Federation of a socialist republic which will give each region the right to construct its life in accordance with its economic possibilities and political preponderance.","There is, therefore, no solution possible other than an economy directed by the workers through their organisations of control-through the workers' syndicates.","In order to fully realise our aspirations, we must create in the masses of the people the sense of sacrifice and responsibility that has been the characteristic of the anarchist movement throughout its historic development in Spain.","We need no messiah and no sterile conception of a god menacing us with hell and purgatory.","In Spain, we should have enough intelligence, enough sense of individual and collective responsibility to do for ourselves that which would be imposed upon us by a dictatorship.","The people themselves, and only the people, determine the rhythm of our fight.","Never will the Anarchists in Spain be made to suffer as they have been and are in Russia."],"Federico Fellini":["If you see with innocent eyes, everything is divine.","My relationship with my body has changed. I used to consider it as a servant who should obey, function, give pleasure. In sickness, you realise that you are not the boss. It is the other way around.","There is no end. There is no beginning. There is only the passion of life.","Realism is a bad word. In a sense everything is realistic. I see no line between the imaginary and the real.","A different language is a different vision of life.","You exist only in what you do.","Talking about dreams is like talking about movies, since the cinema uses the language of dreams; years can pass in a second, and you can hop from one place to another. It's a language made of image. And in the real cinema, every object and every light means something, as in a dream.","All art is autobiographical. The pearl is the oyster's autobiography.","Through the ages, from the beginning of time, I'm certain man has covered woman's face with masks. They are, however, his masks, not hers.","The public has lost the habit of movie-going because the cinema no longer possesses the charm, the hypnotic charisma, the authority it once commanded. The image it once held for us all - that of a dream we dreamt with our eyes open - has disappeared.","I don't believe in total freedom for the artist. Left on his own, free to do anything he likes, the artist ends up doing nothing at all. If there's one thing that's dangerous for an artist, it's precisely this question of total freedom, waiting for inspiration and the rest of it.","I am not the kind of director who sits in a chair smoking a cigar talking with a microphone to 10 assistants. I need to move. To touch. To put a painting on a wall. To arrange a set.","Experience is what you get while looking for something else.","The artist is the medium between his fantasies and the rest of the world.","If you do what you were born to do, I think you will never grow old.","In 'Roma,' I wanted to get across the idea that underneath Rome today is ancient Rome. So close. I am always conscious of that, and it thrills me. Imagine being in a traffic jam at the Coliseum! Rome is the most wonderful movie set in the world... As was the case with many of my film ideas, it was inspired by a dream.","Censorship is advertising paid by the government.","It's easier to be faithful to a restaurant than it is to a woman.","I always direct the same film. I cannot distinguish one from the other.","I make pictures to tell a story, to tell lies, and to amuse.","I'd like very much to make a confident picture. I would like to be as good as nature, which, with a shower, produces flowers and grass to cover the destruction. But we are surrounded by human fragmentation, by pessimism, and it is difficult to talk of other things.","Even if I set out to make a film about a fillet of sole, it would be about me.","I think television has betrayed the meaning of democratic speech, adding visual chaos to the confusion of voices. What role does silence have in all this noise?","Nietzsche claimed that his genius was in his nostrils and I think that is a very excellent place for it to be.","Hype is the awkward and desperate attempt to convince journalists that what you've made is worth the misery of having to review it.","It is only when I am doing my work that I feel truly alive.","When I start a picture, I always have a script, but I change it every day. I put in what occurs to me that day out of my imagination. You start on a voyage; you know where you will end up but not what will occur along the way. You want to be surprised.","A good opening and a good ending make for a good film provide they come close together.","I do not need a producer. I need only a good production manager. I need only a man who will give me money.","All artists are equal when they are themselves.","Money is everywhere but so is poetry. What we lack are the poets.","Fate is written in the face.","A created thing is never invented and it is never true: it is always and ever itself.","God may not play dice but he enjoys a good round of Trivial Pursuit every now and again.","No critic writing about a film could say more than the film itself, although they do their best to make us think the oppposite.","My work has always been the thing that justifies my life.","To people of my generation, the picture show was really another dimension - sensual, whimsical. No uniforms or collective rites, but a place where little boys like me could laugh and feel free.","I did not realise that I was so loved. It can't just be for the films. I must have done something else, but I can't remember what."],"Federico Garcia Lorca":["There is nothing more poetic and terrible than the skyscrapers' battle with the heavens that cover them.","The two elements the traveler first captures in the big city are extra human architecture and furious rhythm. Geometry and anguish.","Besides black art, there is only automation and mechanization.","Green how I want you green. Green wind. Green branches.","With their souls of patent leather, they come down the road. Hunched and nocturnal, where they breathe they impose, silence of dark rubber, and fear of fine sand.","As I have not worried to be born, I do not worry to die.","To see you naked is to recall the Earth.","In Spain, the dead are more alive than the dead of any other country in the world.","The only things that the United States has given to the world are skyscrapers, jazz, and cocktails. That is all. And in Cuba, in our America, they make much better cocktails.","Not for a moment, beautiful aged Walt Whitman, have I failed to see your beard full of butterflies.","New York is something awful, something monstrous. I like to walk the streets, lost, but I recognize that New York is the world's greatest lie. New York is Senegal with machines.","I was lucky enough to see with my own eyes the recent stock-market crash, where they lost several million dollars, a rabble of dead money that went sliding off into the sea."],"Fedor Emelianenko":["A fighter, a real strong fighter, should always look dignified and calm, and I believe that any expression of aggression is an expression of weakness. A strong person will not be nervous and will not express aggression towards his opponent. He will be confident in his abilities and his training; then he will face the fight calm and balanced.","I've never considered myself as a legend - just a simple man with heart.","I'm very grateful to God for what he gives me. Victories, remarkable victories, but you have to go through the defeats. That is why I praise God for everything.","Actually, when I fought in PRIDE, we had the best fighters in the world. Back then, the UFC had a very serious and big crisis; they were going through some tough times trying to get top fighters. All the best fighters were in PRIDE.","It is God who gives us the opportunity to win and to get victories.","For every athlete, it is very important to be able to engage in their favorite thing, give all the best in training, performing in competitions, defending the honor of the motherland.","I train and prepare for every contest the same so I can compete to the best of my abilities.","Training for a fight is never easy, regardless of the opponent.","I have no special strategy. I can just wait to see what my opponent offers.","No one expected me to become a champion.","I would like to have a rematch against Fabricio Werdum.","You know when a person goes into the ring to win, or at least not to lose. I mean, when a fighter is ready and goes to fight, than it can be seen by his look. Regardless of whether he gets hit or not, he goes forward, and regardless of whether he wins or loses, he wants to go forward, and it is clear from his burning eyes.","People are making judgements about Russian people based on me. This is why I never allow myself any aggression towards my opponent.","I don't think about fights that didn't happen.","The UFC didn't want me to fight there so what could I do? We were unable to make a deal. They offered unacceptable conditions.","Most importantly, you have to stay true to yourself as well as those fans who made you who you are as an athlete.","While I'm an athlete and while I'm fighting actively, I don't intend to pursue a career in politics. What happens after that, we'll see. But I don't have an intention to do both at the same time.","If Dana White can offer a contract that's not one-sided, and it's not cumbersome to the point where we look at it and realize that we can't fight for him, then we'll fight in the UFC.","UFC is a moneymaking machine. The most important thing for this organization is a brand and its marketing. They have a couple of good fighters, and there are also some very good champions, but they are trying to keep everyone at the same level. The most important thing for them is the promotion, not the fighters.","I gain strength out of familiar surroundings.","Cain Velasquez, he has some technical difficulties, but he has ambition, and he's fearless. He wants to win so badly, and he's in great condition. He's a thinking fighter.","A true athlete is someone who doesn't just stop training when they stop competing. It's a way of life, and they keep in shape just to keep up that standard.","It's essential for a fighter to go separately and just focus on training away from everybody else.","Dan Henderson has been a fighter for a long time, and he's been a champion in many different organizations.","I've always fought as a heavyweight, and I didn't see any reason to fight at a lighter weight.","I have fought all over the world, and I am excited to be in 'EA Sports MMA' because this game is going to show the global appeal of mixed martial arts.","I always like and appreciate the support for the fans; I am very grateful to everyone who supports me.","I always remember that I am a representative of my country, and I always think about the culture I'm bringing to people.","In my opinion, faith helps in many contexts.","One needs to live every day according to God's commandments. And then any kind of difficulty or unpleasantness will be manageable.","I've already fought my share. God gave me a rich, eventful career, and I thank God for everything, but I'm done fighting.","As human beings, our lives should be in retrospect with God.","I try and make it possible for beginners to start training MMA and not be scared of it as a sport. I try to actually give them the skill set that is necessary - to feel comfortable, maybe not on a big level. And not just Russia, but worldwide.","I am the face and ambassador of sambo. The organization I'm working is trying really hard to make sambo a sport on the Olympian level.","When I was competing, I would run daily 20 kilometers, and in addition to that, I'd put in many hours of fighting and sparring. That's why I was always able to keep the speed in the ring. I would train so hard that sometimes it was not only hard to stand up, but it would also be hard to lay down.","With my victory, I must always remember that I glorify God.","I try to perform honestly during the fight, and I always remember that I'm a representative of Russia. I try not to bring any aggression. Just honesty.","I don't know how much the other fighters make. But I need to tell you that, for myself, money is not the first consideration.","I never believed I was the best fighter in the world.","If people think they've found my biggest weakness, let them try to take advantage of it.","As far as the UFC, if they offer us a fair deal, then we would be open to fighting in the UFC.","In terms of Rogers, I can't comment on how other fighters in the UFC would fare with Brett Rogers because that's just speculation.","The first thing I saw was that Brett Rogers had his way very quickly - in 20 seconds - with a UFC champion, Andrei Arlovski."],"Fefe Dobson":["The things that drive me are poverty, and pain, and knowing that I don't want to end up being alone and I want to do something with my life and I want the name Dobson to remain in everyone's heads.

It's just like all of those experiences that I had during that period - that growing up period.","It's like I've experienced quite a weird and unusual life, you know, being with a mom who's a single parent and struggling with money and things like that. It's really hard. And it brings a lot of other insecurities in life and a lot of other issues in life, in school and a bunch of other things.","I believe that we should be able to marry whom ever we choose. As long as both people are willing... I say go for it!","When you're young you don't think, 'This person is going to change your life.' But when you start recording your own songs, it comes back and reminds you.","You grow and evolve and as you do that, your art hopefully reflects that change and that growth.","I love rock music, I love country music - I love all music, let's be honest!","I would love to work with Jack White or Kanye West.","I'm one of those people that I make a song... then I write another song and then I'm like, 'But this song is so much better than this song,' and then I kind of ditch that song. It's a long process."],"Fei Fei Sun":["Wear some mascara, give attention to your eyebrows, and also take care of your lips.","I like Chanel mascara because it has the darkest black. For my eyebrows, I brush them through to keep them groomed and in place. And for my lips, I wear lip balm. I use Kiehl's Lip Balm #1. It's really helpful during fashion week. If I keep up with these three things, I feel like I look very fresh, young, and natural.","Suzhou is an ancient city full of old gardens that are very famous in China. It is very beautiful.

No religion on earth condones the killing of innocent people; no faith tradition tolerates the random killing of our brothers and sisters on this earth.","Our enemy is not Islam. Islam is not the enemy of America; Americans are not the enemy of Islam. Our real enemy is extremism and radicalism.","Any organization or any individual that targets civilians and kills them for political agenda is a terrorist organization.","Fanaticism and terrorism have no place in Islam.","'Jihad' can mean holy war to extremists, but it means struggle to the average Muslim.","Koran says whoever believes in God in the last day shall be saved. It is a religion whose very name, Islam, comes from the word Shalom, which means peace. It's about establishing peace. We greet each other with peace be upon you, which the Jews do in greeting each other.","A kind of racism still exists in the United States, and Islamophobia is a more convenient way to express that sentiment. There has also been an attempt to paint Muslims as enemies of the United States.","The fundamental idea which defines a human being as a Muslim is the declaration of faith: that there is a creator, whom we call God - or Allah, in Arabic - and that the creator is one and single. And we declare this faith by the declaration of faith, where we... bear witness that there is no God but God.","I read, read enormously on all different fields of Islamic thought, from philosophy to Islamic literature, poetry, exegeses, knowledge of the Hadith, the teachings of the prophet. That's how I trained myself. And then I was appointed imam by a Sufi master from Istanbul, Turkey.","If Muslims curse the Christians, then the Christians will curse the Muslims. And people will curse Allah, and Allah will hold us responsible for that.","The battleground has been moderates of all faith traditions in all the countries of the world against the radicals of all faith traditions in all parts of the world.","God says in the Quran that there is only one true religion, God's religion. It's the same theme that God revealed to all of the prophets, even before Muhammad.","Sufis teach that we first must battle and destroy the evil within ourselves by shining upon it the good within, and then we learn to battle the evil in others by helping their higher selves gain control of their lower selves.","The Islamic method of waging war is not to kill innocent civilians, but it was Christians in World War II who bombed innocent civilians in Dresden and dropped the nuclear bomb on Hiroshima, neither of which were military targets.","We are not going to toy with our religion or any other. Nor are we going to barter. We are here to extend our hands to build peace and harmony.","My life has been devoted to peacemaking.","In the Muslim world, there are many people who have been vocal and we have been very vocal against extremists. But how to win this battle is an ongoing battle. And we must continue to wage the battle for peace.","I condemn everyone and anyone who commits acts of terrorism. And Hamas has committed acts of terrorism.","We've got to be fair. You can't say a place that has strip joints is sacred ground. We've got to be just. We've got to speak the truth. We've got to have justice for everybody. We're a country of justice for all, not justice for non-Muslims only or some groups and not for others.","I have never made a threat. I've never made a threat, never expressed a threat, never - I've never - I would never threaten violence ever, because I am a man of peace, dedicated to peace.","We are Americans. We - we - we are - we are doctors. We are investment bankers. We are taxi drivers. We are store keepers. We are lawyers. We are - we are part of the fabric of America. And the way that America today treats its Muslims is being watched by over a billion Muslims worldwide.","In spite of the polls, the fact is that American Muslims are very happy and they thrive in this country.","One of the misperceptions that exists in the Muslim world, which needs to be fixed, is the perception that Muslims in America are - are - are living in - in very, very, very bad circumstances. They cannot practice religion freely. It is not the truth at all. The fact is, we are practicing. We fast, we pray, we do our prayers.","Religion is defined by the relationship between God and man. And Islam is the submission and the acknowledgment of the human being to the creator.","The thing about the Islamic situation is we don't have a church. We don't have an ordained priesthood, which makes it a little complicated. But we do have a tradition of scholarship, and rules of scholarship. It's very much like any field of knowledge.","You take the best of our tradition as a start, and I'll take the best of Christianity ... From there we can build.","Bigotry toward any faith community cannot have any place in civilized society anywhere in the world.","Islamic law is clearly against terrorism, against any kind of deliberate killing of civilians or similar 'collateral damage.'","There are always people who will - who will do peculiar things and think that they are doing things in the name of their religion.","There are individuals who are working very hard to promote fear and antagonism towards Islam and Muslims in this country. It's fueled, in part, by the first African-American president that we have. Obama's father was a Muslim and people have used this to arouse hostility against him.","I've spoken with friends who are rabbis and priests and we've agreed that most people have an emotional attachment to their faith, a desire to fulfill their spiritual longings, but they are not experts in understanding the history of their religion.","I worked as a teacher in the public school system in New York City for several years, and I was a victim of the layoffs, you know, in the mid-'70s. And then I worked as a sales engineer for a company in New Jersey that was selling industrial filtration equipment.","I was completely surrounded by religion from a young time. I was taught by my father. I engaged in discussions with him and many of these scholars who visited and came around the dining table, the lunch table, and attended many lectures with my dad. And so I learned the apprentice way.","There are moderates in Israel. There are moderates in Iran, there are moderates in the Republican Party, moderates in the Democratic Party. What we need to do is we need link all of these moderates together and to figure out a way by which this particular coalition can speak to important issues to marginalize the voice of the extremists.","The American principles of democracy expresses the deepest values of the Sharia both structurally and in the government... Sharia requires us Muslims anywhere to abide by the law of the land.","I'm not an agent from any government, even if some of you may not believe it. I'm not. I'm a peacemaker.","I am a supporter of the state of Israel.","I am an American citizen born in Kuwait of Egyptian parents. I grew up in Great Britain, Malaysia, and Egypt and have lived in the United States since 1965, when I was seventeen.","When I arrived in America, I experienced serious culture shock. For someone with a religious upbringing, the 1960s were an extremely difficult time. Even though religion was a big part of the civil rights and peace movements, in my college religion was treated as irrelevant, hopelessly stodgy, and behind the times.","In Malaysia, where Western culture was extremely influential, I'd grown up listening to Elvis and the Beatles and watching American movies. People wanted to be like Americans. In contrast, when I got here, I saw prosperous middle-class American college students wanting to somehow join the Third World.","Staying chaste until marriage, a commandment of my faith, was one of the most difficult challenges of my young life. I had a powerful sense that if I did not get a grip on my identity, my ethics, and my religion, I would go off the rails.","In the 20th century, the Muslim world created a vision of religious nationalism. Turkey, for example, had to be ethnically Turkish. Kurds, Armenians, other minorities didn't have a place in such a vision of a nation-state.","The ultimate vision is to instate in the Muslim world the notion of multiculturalism, which is part of our heritage and history, part of the fundamental, mainstream ideals of Islam.","What's brilliant about the United States system of government is separation of power. Not only the executive, legislative, judicial branches, but also the independence of the military from civilians, an independent media and press, an independent central bank.","The world wants to like America.","Americans must outgrow the unbecoming arrogance that leads us to assert that America somehow owns a monopoly on goodness and truth - a belief that leads some to view the world as but a stage on which to play out the great historical drama: the United States of America versus the Powers of Evil.","What's right with America and what's right with Islam have a lot in common. At their highest levels, both worldviews reflect an enlightened recognition that all of humankind shares a common Creator - that we are, indeed, brothers and sisters.","It is part of my responsibility as a bridge builder to speak the truth about what's great about America, what we've done right, and what our less glorious moments. And many people feel that the Iraq adventure, for example, has been one of our less glorious moments.","I as a Muslim want you, as a Christian, to really be a perfect Christian. I want my Jewish friends to be perfect Jews, to live according to the highest principles of what it means to be a Jew, to be a Christian, to be a Muslim.","We tend to forget in the West that the United States has more Muslim blood on its hands than Al Qaeda has on its hands of innocent non-Muslims.","Yusuf Qaradawi is probably the most well-known legal authority in the whole Muslim world today."],"Feist":["Surreal can be exciting and good, and it can be like living inside an alien landscape, and it can be completely interesting, or you can be alienated from your own life - inside your own life, it doesn't feel familiar any more.","So, I'm on 'Sesame Street,' walking around with all these monsters, Elmo and his buddies, a whole bunch of chickens, a whole bunch of penguins and a number four dancing about. It was just pure joy, simple, ridiculous fun, stupid joy. There's no irony. 'Sesame Street' is just a crazy great place to be.","When I did '1,2,3,4' on 'Sesame Street' they'd rewritten the song and made it about counting. At first, I balked. I was like, 'Counting to four? That's where we're going with this?' Then they sent me appearances by other people like James Blunt doing 'You're Beautiful' as 'My Triangle.'","There have been times I've planted stuff in songs where four years later I'll be singing it from a subconscious, kind of chameleon little lizard mind... and at a certain moment, all of a sudden, I'll hear a line from a different vantage point and it'll change its meaning. It's something I wrote but it changed because I did.","When you say something or sing something enough times, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. It's almost like casting spells. I don't mean necessarily in the flighty, 'I'm going to go buy a cloak with a hood now' way.","I'm a Canadian. Outside Canada I carry the flag. Canadian nationalism isn't as insidious as American nationalism, though. It's good natured. It's all about maple syrup, not war.","And of course, pop music is all about memorability and simplicity and positive messages and a little dash of joy.","I once looked over the shoulder of a friend on Facebook and it looked like hieroglyphs to me. There's merit online, of course, but social media gets super freaky. Imagine if three generations from now, people online have forgotten what date or day of the week it is.","'Metals' has partly been about me regaining my self respect and I feel like I'm growing the muscles I want to grow again.","I get really scared about how the Internet is shifting and changing everyone's minds, and the way we see ourselves and interact online. Everything is so diluted now.","'Gatekeeper' was sort of my first attempt to put a little bit of a frame and boundaries around songwriting, and try to figure out a way to approach it that had a sort of end result in mind. I haven't written many like that.","When I first played '1234' it was on stage in San Francisco at some kind of, like, sticky-floored club. And it felt like a punk song. I mean it's ridiculous to say that now, but it had that kind of, like, piercing straight melody. And then this fist-pumping ending, you know that pa-dap-pada.","Well, there's just some universal truths in a way that I've just observed to be true. You read Voltaire. You read modern literature. Anywhere you go, there's these observations about romantic love and what it does people, and these rotten feelings that rarely are people meaning to do that to each other.","Something that I think I figured out slowly was if you're playing a show and there's a chatter or there is, you know, a lot of noise - people talking or something - I was never the one whose instinct was to try to be louder than them.","You're an enormous sponge and everything goes in there and you squeeze it out in songs, I guess. And if you're a painter, you squeeze them out on to a canvas.","I made the first Feist album in '98. So at that point, it was my nickname. It was as far as with my circle of friends, and just felt more accurate than two names.","For me, music is in the choice of what not to play as much as in what you've chosen to play.","You never know what's going to play into what's worthy of getting encapsulated into a song.","I live and die by puns.","I need therapy after writing. It's like leaking blood from a stone. It's brutally difficult but worth it.","If you keep bashing your head against the same wall, at some point you're going to fall over and be still for awhile.","There's real potency in metal. Metal fans love metal as if it's a nation they would fight for. It's not diluted by pop culture.","Opinions are like snowflakes, you know what I'm saying?","When I was in Beck's world, I felt like the little sister. I'm in the big brother's room with all his friends. You just hang out and keep your mouth shut so they don't realize you're there and kick you out. I like being in situations where I can be an underdog, where I can be in the corner and observe and soak it in.","Commercialism isn't challenging creatively; it's only challenging in a stamina way.","I remember doing my mosaics or being in my little hiding place behind the couch snooping. I'd get bored sometimes, of course, but I think that's good for a kid, because it forces you to be creative.","After 'Sesame Street,' it's a hyper-familiar world to me and I have this childlike ability to ignore the fact that I'm talking to scraps of cloth. Every country I go to, I see posters promoting the film in different languages. 'Los Muppets' - I love that!","I guess I found it useful to realise that everything is true at once, you know? You can pull back and say, 'Everything will be fine,' but you can also be in a situation and say, 'Not everything is going to be fine.'","When I wrote 'Mushaboom', I was living in the second verse, but I suddenly found myself in the first.","As I get older, the present and the past shift and become the past and the future... A lot of it is a new awareness of time and life and the wheel of fortune crushing you and lifting you and crushing you and lifting you.","Since I was 19, I've always gone where there was a reason to be. Maybe I'll be lucky and there'll be a reason to go somewhere tropical for a while.","I was a bar-back, which is the person who cleans the bathrooms at the end of the night in the bar, and a cook. I had kind of given up. I was into backing other people up. Music was something I just did on the side and I don't think I had the energy to pimp myself out, like call people up and ask them to book me to play.","There's a crazy amount of goodwill, and I don't know where it came from, and I don't understand, but the more I pay attention to it, the more it's going to sting when it flips, so I think I'm almost subconsciously cultivating this naivety to it all.","There's no mystery any more. So my instinct is to show very little, because there's much too much information about everyone, everywhere right now. Reality TV is an example of that.","Musically, I didn't relate to Berlin. There seemed to be a lot of machine music made there - I don't think I saw a stringed instrument in two years.","I didn't really get London until I read Dickens. Then I was charmed to death by it.","Any kind of anthemic song, for the most part, they're on the positive side of things. It's not hard to identify when a melody is just one degree too complicated or one degree too simple and where that line of pop memorability lies.","The group-effort sound in recording of 'Sea Lion' is like, you really hear all the people in the room and hear them interlocking. There's a real freight-train energy of all these people at the same time playing.","The idea of having one ensemble do everything is what was on 'Sea Lion' and that's what I tried to make happen for 'Metals,' which is having five people in the room and all of us contributing equally to every arrangement and every song.","There's nothing better than not knowing what's going to happen until you put the pieces together.","Music is pretty intimate stuff and I can only work with very few people: Gonzalez being one, Mocky being another and, on a completely different level, Broken Social Scene. With Broken Social Scene it's not one-on-one, it's a one-on-12. It's very healthy, very comfortable, like a big pot luck supper among old friends.","On the videos for '1234' and 'My Moon My Man' I wanted to make the songs visible. And, really, what way can you make sound visible other than good old naive dancing? I was working with a choreographer, but I'm not a dancer. Any notion of elegance is impossible with me.","I've not really spent much time in proper studios. The room itself where you're recording, and how you live while you're there is what appeals to me.","I'd been touring for so long, seven years. For a year and a half I'd just been curious about what it was like not to tour. It's like if you were to lift a 100-pound barbell with your right arm for seven years, eventually you'd get really curious about what your left arm was capable of."],"Felice Picano":["The prime goal of censorship is to promote ignorance, whether it is done via lying and bowdlerized school texts or by attacking individual books.","Having a book censored means something. It means you have deeply offended one or more people who felt they needed to protect unsuspecting readers from your inflammatory words, thoughts, and images.","All writers want to know that someone is reading their work, taking them seriously. It provides a kind of moral support.","To be censored is one sure way of knowing you have been taken dead seriously. It also speaks to the continuing power of the printed word, almost fifteen hundred years after that amazing invention.","I'm an active author: I travel to give readings and talks, although I know it's risky.","I over-scrutinize anyone new entering my life.","I couldn't swear that I believed in the law - or in the American legal system.","I'm 68 years old, and I'm as much a criminal now as I was at the age of 22. And, I'm even more of a dissident than I was then."],"Felicia Day":["Social media is an amazing tool, but it's really the face-to-face interaction that makes a long-term impact.","I feel like maybe I'm part of that generation that became more of a gamer than a video consumer. It's always been something I've done with my spare time. If I had three hours on a Friday night, I'm not out partying. I'm probably playing video games.","Every single job is a challenge. You are walking into a new set, a new character, creating a world and trying to get comfortable to do your best work.","The substance of what it means to be a geek is essentially someone who's brave enough to love something against judgment. The heart of being a geek is a little bit of rejection.","Basically, my socialization as a child didn't come from any schooling; it came from being in theater and meeting people online.","There is definitely a way in which women are raised to be less proactive, less business-oriented, and less willing to jump into creative no man's land. I think media has more of an influence on how we perceive gender identity than anything else.","My favorite 'Mister Rogers' episodes were always the ones where Mr. Rogers would go into the community.","I would never let somebody say that they're me. That would be the ultimate betrayal of what I stand for.","I have a little obsessive-compulsive personality. You can tell because I played online games for eight hours a day.","People don't appreciate that when you're on the Internet, it's a 24/7 job. Even if you're not releasing episodes, your show is living and breathing on the Internet because there's a community around it. Ninety percent of the work is after the web series is shot, and you have to constantly maintain your community, because it's all you have.","That's what I love about the Internet. Even if it's small-scale and you're just posting on a forum, that's an uncensored expression. That's what I love.","I was a child of a tech family. My grandfather was a nuclear physicist and was always a gadget guy.","Finishing games has been something I'm really proud of, seeing something through to the end.","People always ask why I stay in the online space versus going to TV or film, like most people would do, and the answer is that there's opportunity for innovation online - not only innovation in storytelling, but also innovation in how you interact with your audience and that is very fulfilling to me personally.","I guess I just always had this idea that I would go to Hollywood. I had the typical 'get up and go' attitude that you have to have in order to make the brave step into the big city.","I'd been in Hollywood for five years before I started writing 'The Guild.' I worked enough to pay all my bills. So I was very lucky in that respect. Most people don't make a living acting.","Every quirky girl doesn't have to be the best-friend character. It's a very limiting and self-fulfilling prophecy. People only write things that will get green-lit, so they write to those stereotypes.","Just because you have star power and a huge marketing budget, you can see from some professional web series, it doesn't equal views.","I've played pretty much every single-player RPG there is, has been, ever will be. But as far as the MMOs go, especially with the voice chat, it becomes like hanging out with your friends in a chat channel, and you're playing at the same time. So it becomes a lot more social than people would probably think.","I love sitcoms, and I grew up on sitcoms. That's my tasty junk food.","My dad was in the military, yeah. He was in the Air Force, and he was a doctor, so he would go places for six months here, and two years there. And I was home-schooled because I played the violin, and I did a lot of competitions.","When I carve out time to game, it's because I rationalize that I 'deserve it,' so I relish every minute of that 2-3 hour session.","I'll be in a series for three or four episodes, but then I'll be off the series, and downtime, as an actor, is a little more than most people understand. Most of the time you're just sitting around taking coffee with friends.","I'm very persistent; I know the Internet very well, because I grew up on the Internet. I had Internet when there was just dial-up, and the Internet was my social outlet.","I'm a big champion of people doing things outside the system.","I think the more web video there is, the more press you'll get, as well as all the people who want to tell stories that haven't been told before but can't do that on TV because different stories are a risk.","I believe you are never past the point of creating opportunities for yourself.","Voice acting is very different from live-action. You only have one tool to convey emotion. You can't sell a line with a look. It's all about your vocal instrument.","Comic-Con has become more of a pop cultural festival, and to not be included feels like you're missing the biggest celebration of the year.","I learned that lack of budget can be overcome by fan passion if you can get your content to the people who like what you do.","Geek and Sundry has an eclectic line-up of shows all targeted around things I love: Comics, Tabletop Games, Books and more.","At no point am I ever threatened by people who question who I am, or why I like the things I do, or my legitimacy. Because I know who I am very strongly, and I think that's what geek culture can reinforce.","I was a huge fan of video games; I wanted to write something, and I saw the tools at my fingertips to upload a video to my audience, and that's why I'm here today. I think that freedom and the lack of gatekeepers, combined with people's passion, is what really the true spirit of Internet geekdom is about.","For the vlogging channel, I wanted to build the infrastructure and build up all the personalities in a way that felt like weren't just forcing the audience to watch everyone we have.","I don't appeal to everyone well. I appeal to fewer people in a much stronger way. That's what fandom is to me, and what creates fans for everything I make.","Now that we've transitioned to more Smart TVs, where people are broadcasting their cable box, I hope that Geek & Sundry is something that people will click on in the future, knowing that they're going to get content that they love.","I've read every single fantasy novel there is. I mean, I would challenge a lot of people to read more fantasy novels than I have.","I'm super excited about gaming always. That's the thing that I geek out over; those are the vlogs that I'm surfing if I'm not already playing a game at night.","'TableTop' is packed with gaming celebrities and independent game creators. This is a huge subculture that really doesn't have a vehicle to rally around or educate people with.","When I go to a web video meeting and look around, at least half the show runners are women. And a lot are actors-cum-writers who are frustrated with the situation of being a woman actor in Hollywood and have decided to create their own show.","I'd been on 'Buffy' - that is an amazing community, the Joss Whedon fans.","Sustaining an audience with a web series is an impossible task.","I could go off into the wilderness and write fantasy novels for the rest of my life and probably be happy; but I always want to challenge myself.","Nobody sets out to break new ground. I think change comes when people have no other choice.","I think Hollywood has seen what fandom can do for a project. You can definitely see that when you go to Comic-con.","I think the whole definition of a geek is somebody being passionate and focused, and being proud of saying that they're passionate and focused, on a narrow range of subjects.","I still do commercial work as an actor, which I love, because it's very quick, and it definitely pays my bills.","I always enjoyed acting. My aunt was actually an actress.","I came from a dance background, so that's what I did my whole teenage years. I was at the dance studio a lot. It just becomes your social scene and part of your life.","I think every role is always exciting and intimidating. I've never had a role where I wasn't intimidated by it.","Whether you're a Twitter follower, a YouTube subscriber or a Facebook friend, natural social instinct is to collect people and to not kind of see them later. But unfortunately, with social media, you collect them and they're in your life, whether you really want them or not.","On Tumblr, I'm really careful about not following too many things. I enjoy going on there to discover new things more than anywhere else now.","Surprisingly, I think if you're known on the Internet, you're probably an introvert.","I actually did go through severe depression and anxiety attacks where I couldn't sleep for weeks. It was definitely several months of being not myself.","I'm in a very fortunate position, in that if I had an idea, and I could do it on a web budget, I could probably get it made; it's just a question of finding the time to really develop it, because I don't want to make anything that I don't believe in 100 percent.","I'm definitely more of a 'think game' kind of girl. I'll read every single dialogue and codex entry and lore entry. I really do love projecting myself and creating my character.","I created 'The Guild' because nobody was offering me the roles I thought I could do best at in Hollywood.","I'm resigned to the fact that the corseted history of America is not as exciting as that of Britain.","Typecasting is something I have to be careful with, since I play myself on Geek & Sundry so much on my weekly show 'The Flog.' That's why I did 'Dragon Age: Redemption' last year, so I could do something a little more dramatic and hard-edged.","'The Last Of Us,' to me, is just amazing storytelling, because everything's from the character point of view, which even movies don't really do successfully a lot of the time.","If you know your characters well enough, you aren't trying to grasp for storylines. You're really thinking about their flaws and their passions and what they're chasing.","I'm a huge fan of BioWare games. I think they do some of the best character-building. I mean, I have a relationship with Thane from 'Mass Effect' that is as vivid as any crush that I've had on a TV-show character.","That's the great thing about incubating something on the web: you have the potential to go to other platforms. Every single platform has a different audience that you find.","My goal in creating Geek & Sundry was to create a community based around web video, and we've accomplished that, especially on our budget.","My goal with every show we put on Geek & Sundry is to make it that big of a success, not just within the video but within fandom itself.","People don't teach you how to handle the workload that comes from a little bit of success, and it's something I'd never had to handle, because I'd been rejected for so long.","Hollywood typecast me as the secretary. I could have worked as the quirky secretary for the rest of my life, but I decided not to do that.","What I love about what I get to do is that I'm allowed to create the stories that I want to tell with minimal interference by some very big corporations like Microsoft and Sprint and EA and BioWare. The advantage that these tech companies have is that they understand the space organically, versus traditional media companies."],"Felicia Hemans":["Strength is born in the deep silence of long-suffering hearts; not amid joy.","Gird your hearts with silent fortitude, suffering yet hoping all things."],"Felicity Huffman":["The truth is women use contraception not only as a way to prevent unintended pregnancies, but also to improve their health and the health of their families. Increased access to contraception is directly linked to declines in maternal and infant mortality.","I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to just put my hair under a wig cap and slap on a wig that's already done. It's dress up for your hair!","I love actors. I married one. OK, I married a fantastic one.","A win for one is a win for all - and I'm not just saying that because Dumas did.","As you grow up and get educated in the business, you go from, 'I want to do movies' to 'I want to work. In whatever.'","I look OK. I look better in person than I do on film, which is bad because it's how I make my living, but I am not a beauty and on balance I am glad.","Beauty can make you powerful in a way that isn't good for you. Being OK is better for the person I have become.","I can't wait to get my face lifted but my husband says, 'No, don't do it.' I think if it makes you feel better, go for it, but it would be nice if it looked good. There are a lot of people out there who are disasters and you think, 'Why did you do that?'","The pressure on women to be thin is like a plague. I have gone through my life, like a lot of women, rating my experiences on the basis of, 'Was I thin at that time or fat?' And it doesn't seem to let up.","Right after 'Desperate' sold to China, we were the most watched show around the world at the time. That's really something great to be a part of.","Just let your skin breathe.","I have six sisters and two beautiful daughters - that's eight women who mean the world to me. I support the Entertainment Industry Foundation and Lee National Denim Day because they fund programs that are making huge strides in breast cancer research and support.","Congress is attempting to eviscerate women's health care. Like many women across America, I am outraged.","By definition, a hearing is an inquiry into many sides of an issue with testimony from various points of views. But mark this: The Republicans did not have a single woman to testify in support of the contraception mandate. That is not a hearing; that is a sham.","Thankfully, President Obama has stood firmly behind women's health care issues by supporting coverage for contraception and reaffirming commitment to organizations like Planned Parenthood.","Motherhood has been an exercise in guilt.","I was bulimic and anorexic for a while, just hating my body. As an actress, I was never thin enough, never pretty enough. My boobs weren't big enough.","I think I've always had a 40-year-old body, and now that I'm actually there I'm like, 'Hey, pretty good, huh?'","Between work and the kids, I never see anyone anymore. I mean, when I first met with ABC last spring, and they asked me what I'd been doing lately, I said: 'Gee, I have two kids. I'm usually covered with food, wrinkled and feel guilty all the time.","It's only because I feel like such a philistine spending all that time in hair and makeup that I started to knit. I used to spend that time studying Italian and French. Then after I had two kids, my brain turned to mush and I took up knitting.","I go to bed when the kids go to bed because I get up when they get up at 5."],"Felicity Jones":["My mother was in the kind of late-'60s, early-'70s origins of female emancipation. And she was very much like, 'You're not going to be defined by how you look. It's going to be about who you are and what you do.'","It's nice to have some continuity you can come back to. I feel that in coming home, coming back to London.","I make all my decisions by listening to my instinct and then keeping my fingers crossed it will lead to a good place.","You have to be brave and not always play likeable people. It's difficult, because there's a demand for the hero or heroine to be very likeable.","I actually always had short hair as a kid, and it's really liberating. I recommend it. It's just very easy. I don't have to brush it.","I'd studied English literature at university, but I was also far more enamored with Virginia Woolf, Katherine Mansfield, and James Joyce. That was my passion.","The more you work, the more people can see that you're something different from what's come before.","In everyday life, I like APC, Isabel Marant, but I also like Zara. It depends how I'm feeling on the day. I like clothes that have a certain strength to them - simple but graphic.","The key is working with great directors. A film is so many different people and all their talents, but particularly the directors, because of the idiosyncrasies of that person.","I'm interested in all forms of performance, yet I think it's difficult to be as equally talented in all of them as they call for such different skills. At the moment, I still feel I'm learning and want as much experience and variety as possible.","I'm very excited that I can get on a skateboard and skateboard down the street now. That was something I never thought I'd be able to do. I conquered my fears.","Day to day, I always wear eyeliner on my top lid and mascara. I like to do my own makeup, it depends on the event.","I'm a masochist in some ways. I look for things that I think I can't do, then, for some bizarre reason, I really want to do them. Maybe one day I'll take the easy route.","I would describe my look as 'ladylike rock chick.'","I hardly ever watch the news... I love reading newspapers, but I know they're dying out.","I'm a horrible perfectionist and very highly strung. That's why I do yoga: to unwind.","In a way, 'Like Crazy' keys into our generation, this idea of now we can still be in communication. Where do the boundaries of relationships end?","I love going swimming. I spent a lot of time in North London in summer going to Hampstead Heath and swimming in the ponds there. It's so beautiful; we're so lucky to have that in London.","My boy cousins used to sit my older brother and me down and take us through a film-studies course. It included 'Tremors', 'The Goonies', and, of course, 'Star Wars'. That was when it began: sitting cross-legged watching as the opening crawl goes up the screen.","I think there is an enormous appetite for great roles for women.","I am definitely romantic, and I love romantic stories - that's why I keep making romantic movies.","I was thinking 'Love Story', obviously, was a romantic film of that time.","A fashion show is like a 10-minute play, but there's all this anticipation; Everyone arriving, finding their seats, then there's 10 minutes of people walking past and clothes and music, then the whole thing is finished.","London is my home. I miss my family so much; it's hard being away. And I miss salt and vinegar crisps. And Marmite. And good fudge. Oh my God. Clotted cream fudge.","When you're a young actor, there's this pressure to rush. But I hope to be doing this into my sixties and seventies, so I'd prefer to take my time.","I think you're attracted to things that are different from yourself in a character because it's more interesting, and you get to play out a fantasy version of yourself.","There's so much of a desire in the entertainment industry for newness, a desire to build somebody up and then treat them as old news within six months. I think you'd be naive if you didn't try to hold on to your own way of doing things.","Of everything I have done, 'The Archers' always gets the most excitement; there's a sort of uncontrollable joy from fans of the program.","Acting has always existed alongside my normal life. It's been a case of learning on the job. I've worked in so many styles, with so many people, so I've picked bits up from everyone and everything.","I guess I'm a bit of a romantic.","It can be very intense being an actor; it can be quite a small world. Then you speak to your friend who is a scientist and they have a completely different perspective.","But for everyone, I think, there is always a pressure to conform, and I guess as you get older you realize it's less interesting to do that. It starts with you, though, saying, 'I know what I like doing and that's what I'm going to do.'","I think, as an actor, you're always traveling. There's a sense of dislocation sometimes from home.","I'm not really massively into going out. I'm much more of a hibernator. It's nice to have people come to your house or go to someone's house, I think.","A lot of my time is spent watching films and reading scripts. And it can be all-consuming. And it's obviously something I'm fortunate that is both my work and my hobby. It's what I would naturally be doing anyway.","I'm attracted to playing people who aren't necessarily straightforward.","I always wear the shoes of the character a week before going on set; the idea of just putting on a new pair of shoes on the first day of filming is just horrific.","I'm very independent, creatively, always trying to push myself - and I think that comes from my mother.","If it's something quite low-key then I'll often do my own makeup. But for something like a premiere, it's good to have a makeup artist because they know what they're doing.","I don't like when I look too cluttered.","I'm not a huge jewelry fan.","You just have to take these opportunities when they come along. They're not that frequent; you'll get a really good script, oh, maybe once a year if you're lucky.","As a child, I always liked dressing up and getting into character, and actors are lucky in being able to retain that playfulness, though we do seem to find it hard to grow up.","It was only after university that I said to myself that I had to take the risk and have a serious go at acting. It's such a bizarre profession, because you have to be totally tough to deal with all those times when you're being turned down, and then really soft in order to access your character's emotions.","I've never done a superhero movie. It's very nice to you as an actor in several worlds to go and to experiment.","I don't have much time for shopping so I pick things up when I can. My favorite labels are APC, Isabel Marant and Agnes B because the clothes are cut small and have a simplicity to them.","I have a great plain blue shirt from APC, and a denim one from Dolce that I wear constantly. It's hard to find the perfect denim shirt, but this is it.","My most treasured item is the brown leather bag that my mum bought me from a little Italian shop for my 21st. It's supposed to be a vanity bag, but I use it as a handbag.","I use SPF every day, then apply foundation, mascara, eyeliner and blusher. I always take my make-up off at night and moisturize.","There's such a sense of theatre in getting glammed up; it's like putting on a play or short film.","My mother worked in advertising and my father was a journalist. But they split up when I was three and I grew up in a single-parent family. My mum brought my brother and I up.","I think that when something happens when you're growing up, like a death or divorce, it does open the world slightly because things aren't as straightforward.","Fashion choices are never arbitrary. Even if you say you don't care, that's a decision. There's something you're trying to say.","I'm more of a freestyle dancer. I like to do my own thing.","I'm used to doing independent film where the style is a lot more casual. With improvising, you obviously find so much out on the day - and in a way, I feel more comfortable doing that.","With every film that you do, you're always so nervous. You feel exposed because you know people will see this eventually. You sort of have to put all that out of your head. What will be will be. But it's nerve wracking.","I think human nature is eternal and constant.","Once you're playing someone, you shouldn't be judging them in any way. That's what being an actor is - it's having empathy for people that are different from yourself. Once you've committed to that person, your responsibility is to tell that story.","I am quite fortunate, because I can still be quite incognito. If you go out looking for attention, then you'll attract it, but if you're just getting on with your life, particularly in London where everyone is engrossed in what they're doing, you can keep a measure of anonymity.","I was a very rotund child with short hair, and for some reason, I always had black ballet shoes. I was like the Wednesday Addams of ballet.","It is disheartening when you read an interview with an actress, and it starts by describing what she is wearing.","I think there is an enormous appetite for great roles for women. You can see that clearly with things like 'The Hunger Games.'","I always think Michelle Williams is excellent in her work. And I do love Sofia Coppola. She always creates something so atmospheric. I love Wes Anderson, Roman Coppola, Andrea Arnold.","I don't think my parents would have let me go straight into acting full time when I was 12. I do like to have balance, naturally, as an individual.","For everyone, 'Star Wars' has been a part of their lives in some capacity. I remember watching it very early on with my cousins and my brother, and we were all cuddled around the VHS player, which sounds very old-fashioned, but that was the way then.","There's so much that goes into a film that I feel like it's a bit arrogant to say, 'Oh, I never watch my own movies.' Well, it's not just you. There's a whole host of other people. So much skill goes into it. But I would say it does take a couple times seeing it to get a level of perspective.","Any creative process comes with a level of self-analysis and self-criticism. There's a lot of waking up in the middle of the night going, 'Oh, I wish I had done that differently.'","You have to have a bag of Yorkshire Tea bags. It is the best tea that England has to offer, and that comes with me everywhere I go.","Without sounding too pretentious, I feel my job is almost like becoming a monk or a nun - it's a calling.","When I come home, I am literally the most popular person with my friends' parents for doing 'The Archers.'","I've never done this level of physical preparation for something. Particularly for 'Rogue One' where I was training every day and doing kung fu rehearsals on a daily basis. But that's part of the reason I wanted to do it, because it was very different from what I've done before.","When I was 11 years old, I was a member of 'Press Pack,' which was a thing that would come out in 'The Sunday Times' in England. You'd write articles and send them off and would get a badge saying 'Official Press.' I was really excited about my badge.","I think that my parents' divorce gave me a very strong sense of self-reliance and independence. I realised that I needed to make sure I could support myself because you don't know what's going to happen in the future.","I think actors always find the dialogue doesn't quite fit, so you always have to play with it.","I like to jump into different worlds. I'm attracted to the emotional rollercoaster of acting. Now I've been doing it for so many years, I must rather enjoy it.","The actresses I've known support each other very much. If you have a level of confidence in what you're doing, then you don't feel threatened. We all have different things to offer.","I learnt circus skills in drama group, so I can juggle.","I'm obsessed with subtexts. I love that we often don't say what we feel. That gap between the two. I like it when actors reveal a lot without having to say it.","Emotional messiness is my reason for life. In acting, it's so important.","I love the Spider-Man story. I watched the cartoon on TV when I was a kid, and my brother wore his Spider-Man pyjamas everywhere.","I just took everything so seriously in my early twenties. But now I'm like, 'life can be fun.' You don't have to overthink everything. I've found a way to be more at peace with things. I'm looking forward to turning 30.","I think the writing skills of actors are sometimes underestimated.","I love spending time researching a character and reading about them.","Actors and directors work on things together. That's how I like to work, anyway. I don't want to be told what to do. I want to share it with someone and work it out together.","I'm happiest when I'm discussing a script and working with interesting people.","It always starts with a script. I like to have plenty of time to read something, and I always like to read a paper copy. I hate reading it on email. I sit down with a script, and want to see how it hits me. It's an instinctive process.","If you're in a film that you're proud of and you care about, then you're always happy to talk about it.","I actually studied literature at university, so I'm much more of an arts-based person, but I remember I actually did enjoy physics because you got to do weird experiments. I remember we did this thing with static where we all had to put our hands on this static ball to see that your hair would all stand on end.","I love French films, and I copy things I see in them. I read magazines and also look at Tumblr. I love nails, so I literally just search the word 'nails' on Tumblr and start looking.","My bag always weighs a ton. I carry my whole bathroom with me. You never know what's going to happen in a day!","I always take off my makeup. My mother always told me to do this, and I never go to bed without doing it. I use a good moisturizer and Mario Badescu face wash.","I always love listening to Bob Dylan. 'Blood on the Tracks' is one of my favorite albums.","I think we're very lucky that there is a tradition of British actors working in America and being respected in America, and I've always liked Kate Winslet and her work and respected her.","I love 'Annie Hall'; I will always come back to that film again and again. Diane Keaton has been such an inspiration to me. She always brings humour, but complexity, and I love watching her on screen. She's got real charisma.","I usually have two or three books on the go at the same time. If I'm in different moods, I want to read different things.","I have such an eclectic taste. I like listening to classical music and pop music.","She was obsessed with French and Swedish cinema. I also remember our mother showing us 'Gone With the Wind' very early on. She absolutely loved Vivien Leigh, so it must have been a formative experience for me, thinking, 'Oh, maybe one day I'll be like Vivien Leigh.'","Interviewing someone is very similar to preparing a character, isn't it? You're just asking questions: 'Who is this person? Why did they make that choice? Why are they doing that?' You're being Sherlock Holmes.","I always had a very strong sense of independence. I really liked being able to buy my Alanis Morissette 'Jagged Little Pill' album. I wore that as a badge of honor. I love not having to rely on anyone.","My agent called me up and said, 'There is a tremendous female lead in the new 'Star Wars' film, and I think you're really going to like it.' The opportunity to play someone determined, who's trying to find her skills as a leader; to be in a fantasy movie; to be able to do a leading female role in a film of that scale - that's very, very rare.","I've always been a feminist, and what I love in my work is being able to explore a full-sided woman and not patronize her.","I did think that acting would be much more like being a pop star. Now I'm here, I can't think of anything more different.","I would be writing an essay that was due in the next day until about 1 A.M., and then I would be up at 6 A.M. and on a train to Birmingham to record 'The Archers'. It was pretty intense.","I don't actually think there has ever been too much emphasis on what I am wearing.","It's funny how seeing a love story never gets boring, because it's the dream, isn't it? It's the dream to have a true connection with another human being.","My grandmother has dementia, and my mother is looking after her as her primary caregiver. Seeing their relationship has had a profound impact, seeing how tough it is for both of them and seeing how the roles change and how my mother has gone from being a daughter to being the mother.","The ideal would be to have a career like Meryl Streep's or Kate Winslet's. It's just unbelievable how they manage to make such incredible choices one after the other. If you could have a career anything like that, then that would be a great thing.","When you're a skateboarder or a snowboarder, it affects the way you talk, the way you move, the way you interact with the world and other people.","On 'Rogue One,' we had these sets with tiny little buttons that would light up when you pressed them, and screens full of graphics, and it really felt like you were driving a spaceship. The level of detail; you'll be two meters away from where the action is, but there'll be a little detail there just in case the camera catches it.","It's nice to film in somewhere that you actually love being. Usually, you're in a studio for months on end, and you never see any daylight, so you really make the most of it.","I just always want to play people. I don't want it to be necessarily that you relate to the character as female or male, but that you relate to them as a person. That's the driving force.","I've heard directing talked about as being a benign dictatorship, and I think that's probably the best way a director should be. They're open to collaboration and feedback from people, but ultimately, it's got to be that one person's vision. That's what I think makes a film really stand out.","I was so passionate about wanting the role in 'Like Crazy,' I filmed myself in the shower because that's where one of the scenes was set. It just felt instinctive. It was a close up! It would have been strange if I'd sent off a wide shot of myself. That's not the kind of work I want to do!","It can be frustrating when you're put in a category with others. Women do get lumped together in this reductive grouping, and you think, 'Gosh, that rarely happens with the boys.' I'm sure people don't say to Eddie Redmayne, 'How do you feel about Andrew Garfield?'","The luxury of radio is that you don't spend hours in make-up, and you can wear whatever you want. It's bizarre. You'll be saying lines, with various people around making sound effect noises.","Often the last thing I want to do is stand up in front of 50 cameras on the red carpet. I'd rather have a cup of hot milk and an early night.","I love being able to change from big films to small films.","I feel like I personally have been lucky.","If the part isn't always there on the page, I've had good relationships with writers where there's an openness to bring more to the role.","I'd love to do more comedy. It'd just be nice to go into work and not be crying every day. Some broad slapstick would be great. Falling over banana skins would be wonderful.","When a relationship with a director is really working, you have the same idea at the same time. You go, 'Look, this isn't working,' and they'll go, 'I know it's not working. What are we gonna do?' And you go and try something else.","'Great Expectations' has become one of my favorite books.","When you're in the head of the character, you feel less self-conscious. If I was just being me, I would feel so exposed and be like, 'Why is there a huge camera in my face?' But, when you're believing in the person that you're playing, you feel protected. It's about being true to that person you're playing.","Nothing beats an 'Archers' fan for their levels of devotion. I think it's because it's radio, and you obviously conjure up an image of the character that is so powerful.","I think it's absolutely about time that we have as many female leads as male. It's a very exciting time to be an actress.","People keep saying how amazing it is having a female lead, and I just sort of feel, 'Well, of course!'","While you are improvising, you need to be prepared, and I like to have a sense of who the character is, what she likes to read, where she grew up, where we went to school, and what she has for breakfast, so that when I go to set, I'm free to explore.","I love moments in film where there's no dialogue, and somebody communicates something with a look that kills you. That's why I love going to the cinema.","You still slightly down that you're ever going to work again, every time you finish something. That's the territory of being an actor. It's like anything that's competitive. It takes a lot of determination. I just feel lucky to be able to do something that I really love.","I actually love doing comedy!","I want to be paid fairly for the work that I'm doing. That's what every single woman around the world wants. We want to be paid on parity with a man in a similar position."],"Felicity Kendal":["We take ourselves so seriously moment by moment, but India shows you a sense of eternity. You're one little ant on a hill. You're part of life, but you're not the whole thing.","I love a mask. It's why I've got a thing about good writing. When you're acting, you're going into someone else's work. You're behind his words; it's not you.","My father was my trainer, my teacher. He was closer to my sister in the sense that she adored him and he adored her. He was more like my pal. Because of the 13-year gap, I think by the time I came along, it wasn't a big deal. I wasn't spoilt or cherished, I was just put to work.","For me, compatibility is a sense of humour, being able to laugh together; that is very important.","When I was little I always thought I was marked out, special, on the verge of something momentous. I used to tingle with anticipation.","I am used to looking good. In a way, if I thought I looked like the back end of a bus, I probably wouldn't have done 'Strictly Come Dancing' and gone out there in public.","Every time we moved on, I joined a different class in a different school with different girls until, aged 13, my father had taken the decision to pull me out of school altogether. Everything I needed, he reasoned, could be found within the rich language of Shakespeare's plays at which, by then, I was something of an old hand.","From the early days of the Raj, Shakespeare had been woven into the fabric of India's education, and my father understood that in a culture rich with storytelling and fantastical tales, Shakespeare's characters and storylines resonated in a powerful way.","I don't treasure things much - just people. And pets.","As we have more women in power, so the plays and the TV dramas are reflecting what's happening.","Every woman feels she is too old and has missed the boat.","I do still get the odd fan letter about The Good Life, clearly written by somebody aged 18, who says: Will you send a photograph? And I think: Maybe it's kinder not to. I'm deeply into my 50s now.","I hope to start enjoying flirting again when I'm 70, like my mother did.","I think you have to relax about aging. What else can you do?","I'm sure people in the business have said: She's too old for that part. I don't hear about it because your agent protects you from those negative things.","So many roles for women demand that you make the audience fall in love with you or sympathise with you.","Success breeds success, and failure leads to a sort of fallow period.","The girl-next-door image is a sort of joke; for years, I couldn't get any roles other than as somebody dark.","When I was much younger, I sometimes felt rejected by feminists because of an image that I sold because it paid the bills. Any fool could tell my hair is dyed.","I haven't done fillers or Botox for ages. There comes a point where you have to match bits of you with the other bits; otherwise, you get a terribly random situation.","It's nice not to have lines when you frown, especially on TV. I don't know why people make such a fuss about it. No one is interested if a woman has her teeth capped or her hair dyed.","It's difficult to say what attracts one person to another. It's always a combination, isn't it? I've always found people interesting because of the way they think, and a sense of humour is irresistible.","I think very few people do find a relationship where, every moment of every day, everything they do comes together. That's why, in a nutshell, everyone loved Barbara in 'The Good Life.' She was the perfect partner. It was a formula. She wasn't glamorous. She wasn't clever. But she was a good partner. That's too easy, too perfect.","A lot of my close friends are nothing to do with show business. But the people I've had relationships with, invariably, I've worked with. I think that's probably because I grew up in a family where we all worked together, so it's something I feel comfortable with.","I really do believe there are things passed down. Behaviour, not just DNA. Psychological make-up. You can see it in dogs. If you want to breed a calm dog, don't get two fighters.","I wouldn't trade anything for family time. To me, it is more important than everything else, and I have a very deep-rooted belief in it, which is influenced by my Jewish faith. That's a very great source of who I am and what I believe in.","I think in the acting world you either manage that transition to older roles, or you stick with what you've always done and then discover nobody can bear you doing it as an older person.","The gym is where I get my chill-out time. I try to go six days a week, but when I'm working, that goes down to about three.","I love gentle, gorgeous classical music such as Mozart.","I don't think I've ever not had a dark side. But one of the wonderful reasons why you go into this business is that half your life you live in a fantasy, which is somebody else's life. It's actually a great release because you're not having to deal with the itty-bitty bits of life.","I did try fillers once. Don't ever have fillers because when your cheekbones are high, it's chipmunk time.","My parents were very volatile but very loving. My father would get jealous if my mother looked at somebody. I used to be insanely jealous. It comes out of insecurity. It can come and go, but you get to the point in life where you don't have this raging jealousy and protectiveness about your world.","I don't think, until you've actually lost somebody you really love, that you can go through that door that allows you to be grown-up.","Looking back, I got the bed I wanted and I lay in it. I didn't want to go to America. If you want to join that world, you have to go and live there, and that was something I could not have done. I am very much about family. It doesn't matter where I live, but I feel very needful of my people around me. Besides, theatre is my first love.","There is the most wonderful thing called Polaris: it's a very high frequency laser treatment that lifts and tightens the skin.","I can be very difficult if people are not professional, or lazy - or the opposite, which is take themselves too seriously.","I have to say I am a 'Strictly' fan, which is why I am in it. I've always watched it for years. I am not an 'X Factor' fan, and I just think it is a different show. One is about learning something new and having a great time, and the other is rather desperate.","I'm not very much of a foodie; I like small amounts of delicious things, but I've never overeaten - I'd much rather have a glass of wine.","I'm lucky in that I don't like sweet things at all. My father loved cakes to such a degree that he kept forcing them down my throat when I was little, and it put me off for life. He had terrible cholesterol, poor thing.","It was in India that I started my acting career, courtesy of my parents, long before I set foot on stage in England. They headed a company of travelling players performing Shakespeare up and down the land.","After making my stage debut aged nine as Macduff's small son in 'Macbeth,' I had played a number of parts, from 'Twelfth Night's Viola to 'The Merchant Of Venice's Portia'.","The problem men seem to have, and women, too, is that they have this very structured idea that we should find a partner and settle down and be, you know, faithful. And yet clearly this is really, really hard for anybody to do!","In a play, the director is God, and I'm a great arguer. Rather boringly so, I think, about trying different things.","I don't take money seriously, so I can't keep any."],"Felipe VI of Spain":["Sincere and generous collaboration is the best way to fulfil the legitimate aspirations of each person and achieve great collective goals for the common good and the general interest.","We have a great country, we are a great nation - let us trust in it.","The crown must constantly earn citizens' appreciation, respect and trust.","I begin my reign with profound emotion at the honour of accepting the Crown, aware of the responsibility it entails and with the greatest hope for the future of Spain.","Public office must not be a means to profit or become rich.","In a unified and diverse Spain, based on the equality of and solidarity between its people, there is room for all of us. And for all of our feelings and sensitivities and our distinct ways of being Spaniards.","Spain and the United States share the same values of democracy, liberty and fundamental freedoms.","I want to reaffirm, as king, my faith in the unity of Spain.","Millions of Spaniards have Catalonia in their hearts.","Our primary objective must be to prevent wars, and when we fail in this, we must protect and assist the innocent victims.","You will find in me a loyal head of state who is ready listen and understand, warn and advise as well as to defend the public interest at all times.","There must not be favoured treatment for those occupying a position of public responsibility.","Today, more than ever, citizens demand with good reason that moral and ethical principles be upheld and that exemplariness preside over our public life. And the king, as the head of state, must not only be an example but also a servant to that just and legitimate demand of the citizens.","We must never relent in our efforts to resolve conflicts through diplomacy and through all of the instruments bestowed by the Charter of the United Nations.","We mustn't hesitate to cut corruption at its roots.","We all have our place in this diverse Spain.","I embody the renewed monarchy for a new time.","It is possible for political forces to agree.","Together, for over 50 years, King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia have devoted themselves to Spain.","The men and women of my generation are heirs to that great collective success which has been admired worldwide and of which we are so proud. It is now up to us to pass it on to the coming generations."],"Felix Adler":["The past speaks to us in a thousand voices, warning and comforting, animating and stirring to action.","The family is the school of duties - founded on love.","The hero is one who kindles a great light in the world, who sets up blazing torches in the dark streets of life for men to see by.","The exercises of our meeting are to be simple and devoid of all ceremonial and formalism.","Where the roots of private virtue are diseased, the fruit of public probity cannot but be corrupt.","Perhaps a hundred people assembled one evening, May 15, 1876, at the time when the country was celebrating the hundredth anniversary of its political independence.","If you desire information on some point of law, you are not likely to ponder over the ponderous tomes of legal writers in order to obtain the knowledge you seek, by your own unaided efforts.","You do not build your own houses, nor make your own garments, nor bake your own bread, simply because you know that if you were to attempt all these things they would all be more or less ill done.","The platform of an Ethical Society is itself the altar; the address must be the fire that burns thereon.","Simplicity should not be identified with bareness.","Few are there that will leave the secure seclusion of the scholar's life, the peaceful walks of literature and learning, to stand out a target for the criticism of unkind and hostile minds.","We measure our enjoyments by the sum expended.","The office of the public teacher is an unenviable and thankless one.","The freedom of thought is a sacred right of every individual man, and diversity will continue to increase with the progress, refinement, and differentiation of the human intellect.","The Ethical Society, therefore, is like a Church in maintaining, and emphasizing the importance of maintaining the custom of public assemblies on Sunday.","The ethical manifold, conceived of as unified, furnishes, or rather is, the ideal of the whole.","No one can fail to see that the power of the Church among large numbers in many communities is today diminishing, or has already ceased.","In a country of such recent civilization as ours, whose almost limitless treasures of material wealth invite the risks of capital and the industry of labor, it is but natural that material interests should absorb the attention of the people to a degree elsewhere unknown.","For more than three thousand years men have quarreled concerning the formulas of their faith.","FOR a long time the conviction has been dimly felt in the community that, without prejudice to existing institutions, the legal day of weekly rest might be employed to advantage for purposes affecting the general good.","An anxious unrest, a fierce craving desire for gain has taken possession of the commercial world, and in instances no longer rare the most precious and permanent goods of human life have been madly sacrificed in the interests of momentary enrichment.","Admitting the force of these contentions, nevertheless, the custom of meeting together in public assembly for the consideration of the most serious, the most exalted topics of human interest is too vitally precious to be lost.","Love of country is like love of woman - he loves her best who seeks to bestow on her the highest good.","Love is the expansion of two natures in such fashion that each include the other, each is enriched by the other.","No religion can long continue to maintain its purity when the church becomes the subservient vassal of the state.","Every dogma, every philosophic or theological creed, was at its inception a statement in terms of the intellect of a certain inner experience.","Ethical religion can be real only to those who are engaged in ceaseless efforts at moral improvement. By moving upward we acquire faith in an upward movement, without limit."],"Felix Baumgartner":["Sometimes you have to go up really high to understand how small you really are.","I started skydiving because I loved the idea of freedom.","I'm 100 percent sure I'm becoming a really good helicopter pilot.","Aviation - and space travel, in particular - have always been especially captivating.","If the Wright brothers hadn't put their lives on the line, we would not be flying around the world these days. So we need pioneers.","I feel comfortable with what I do and I guess that my girlfriend feels the same.","People are fascinated about the world above them because it seems so out-of-reach.","The stratosphere is a hostile place.","I've done a lot of things in a business where you're lucky to stay alive, so when the time comes, I'll be happy to pass my knowledge along and help someone else.","Let me tell you - when I was standing there on top of the world, you become so humble. You don't think about breaking records anymore, you don't think about gaining scientific data - the only thing that you want is to come back alive.","To jump and break the sound barrier will not be a mere record breaking experience or another extreme event that ends once the mission is accomplished.","I was crossing the English Channel with a carbon-fiber wing on my back.","Well, to me, my past accomplishments weren't crazy. They required a lot of skill and careful planning.","As a little kid, I climbed a lot of trees because I always loved the bird's-eye view.","At a certain R.P.M., there's only one way for blood to leave your body, and that's through your eyeballs. That means you're dead.","I always feel the danger because you might always be subject to an unexpected or emergency event.","Heroes don't wear diapers. It's just not cool.","I'm now a member of a pretty small club.","I like to challenge myself.","They call me Fearless Felix.","Normally, when I skydive, even in winter, I wear very thin gloves. I want to be flexible, with fast reactions.","This claustrophobia was the only weakness I had. It's not my fault. It's just in my mind.","Well, I jumped for the first time when I was 16. I just loved it and immediately realized that it was what I wanted to do.","I have a lot of fears that normal people have.","I had to work with a psychiatrist.","If I do something, it's always 90% obvious and 10% unknown.","I'm retired from the daredevil business.","I want to find a nice decent job as a helicopter pilot.","I don't like to rate myself; others can do that.","I can't bear the thought of my mother having to push me around in a wheelchair. I'd rather die quickly.","I have no privacy anymore.","People should decide 'are you willing to spend all this money to go to Mars?' I think the average person on the ground would never spend that amount of money - they have to spend it on something that makes sense and this is definitely saving our planet.","You have seen on TV how hard it is to go up 129,000 feet and how hard it is to come down.","Of course my life has changed because now everybody knows who Felix Baumgartner is.","I always had the dream of flying, and the cheapest way is to become a skydiver.","I base jumped off the Jesus statue in Rio de Janeiro.","I base jumped off one of the highest buildings in the world.","I'm more a competitive person."],"Felix Bloch":["I am sure my fellow-scientists will agree with me if I say that whatever we were able to achieve in our later years had its origin in the experiences of our youth and in the hopes and wishes which were formed before and during our time as students.","Free imagination is the inestimable prerogative of youth and it must be cherished and guarded as a treasure.","In talking to you I feel very much more at ease than my colleagues who gave the speeches during the banquet.","Instead of explaining the sober facts of mechanics and electricity, I want to say a few words about the debt which we owe to youth; and with your permission I shall consider you as representing here not only the academic youth of Sweden nor even of Europe but also of America.","It seems that this situation is not restricted to science but is more generally human.","It is inevitable that many ideas of the young mind will later have to give way to the hard realities of life.","But these realities will make themselves felt soon enough and while I am certainly not asking you to close your eyes to the experiences of earlier generations, I want to advise you not to conform too soon and to resist the pressure of practical necessity.","Thanking you once more, I want to wish you the best of luck for your future life and to conclude by saying to you: Dream your dreams and may they come true!"],"Felix Dennis":["You'll never get rich by working for your boss.","Making money is certainly the one addiction I cannot shake.","It's a long, slow sunset for ink-on-paper magazines, but sunsets can produce vast sums of money.","People who get trapped in the tunnel vision of making money think that is all there is to life.","I think having a great idea is vastly overrated. I know it sounds kind of crazy and counterintuitive. I don't think it matters what the idea is, almost. You need great execution.","The beginnings of a forest is one of the ugliest things on the planet. It's bleak and your neighbours hate you.","False praise is worse than no praise.","Good ideas are like Nike sports shoes. They may facilitate success for an athlete who possesses them, but on their own they are nothing but an overpriced pair of sneakers. Sports shoes don't win races. Athletes do.","America is an empire. I hope you know that now. All empires, by definition, are bumbling, shambolic, bullying, bureaucratic affairs, as certain of the rightness of their cause in infancy, as they are corrupted by power in their dotage.","Nobody could like Donald Trump, surely, except his mother. No one really likes The Donald. But how can you not have respect for a guy who's been down on the floor and just keeps coming back? Nothing will keep Donald Trump down until they drive a wooden stake in his heart and a silver bullet in his brain.","You don't have to live in a garage to write great poetry.","I write about whatever turns up. Every single day, I'm sitting down for three to five hours in the evenings wrestling away and producing far too much verse.","For me, temptation is life and I have a gargantuan appetite for everything.","In the end, the railroads made America and nanotech will make the 21st century, and that is the end of the story. The beginning of the story and the end of the story.","What is negotiation but the accumulation of small lies leading to advantage?","It's kind of a crazy thing to decide that you're going to be worth tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars and set out to do that. It doesn't suit everybody.","You have to persuade yourself that you absolutely don't care what happens. If you don't care, you've won. I absolutely promise you, in every serious negotiation, the man or woman who doesn't care is going to win.","You shouldn't go around the world behaving ruthlessly when you don't have to. Sometimes you do have to. There is only so much pie to go around. If you're going to take more than your fair share of pie, as socialists would look at it, then someone else is not getting his. That means you've got to take it away from them.","This modern mania for interfering in other's lives, usually under the guise of health and safety concerns, is highly irritating and counterproductive. Down with the nanny state.","I couldn't care less what anyone's 'perception' of me is. I'm too long in the tooth to care.","With the greatest of respect, I have watched Apple from the day it started. I was publishing magazines about the Apple II before most people had ever heard what a personal computer was.","Discourse has ended in America. It's all just shouting and ranting and demonization. Do you know how the rest of the world laughs at you guys? Have you got any idea? They're just rocking with laughter night and day.","I'm very proud of the fact that I'm one of Britain's biggest selling poets. That gives me a huge amount of pleasure.","Publishing magazines for yourself is not good business, man.","'The Week' is my favourite magazine. Everyone from presidents to CEOs of companies love it, politicians, people in the massive charity business in America, in the arts and even more especially in the media.","The age of celebrity editors and monstrous staffing are over.","I love the business of business; I love the risk raking.","Native trees are so important to our ecosystem.","Human beings are definitely changing the planet, but how much impact they are having on climate, I don't know and I don't care.","There are as many forms of happiness as sorrow, though most prove fleeting.","I have been portrayed by actors in three television documentaries, two plays, one musical and a film. It's no fun watching yourself being traduced and imitated by an actor.","I want to prove that if you write in strict meter and rhyme about subjects people care about, they will buy poetry.","I am absolutely convinced that my life was redeemed by poetry.","You cannot be seeking yourself when you're making money.","I have an over-attachment to precision, which is why I've sold more magazines than any man alive.","No poetry that I'm aware of, however bad or glorious, has ever left somebody a worse person than they were before they read it.","I cannot abide being bored.","There are far too many people in university in Britain. If you want to make money, be a plumber.","With a poetry book I can send 100 copies out to reviewers and other people, and even do it in advance and get their response. It's difficult with iPad: how do you send it out for free, and how do you even disseminate it before it goes into their store?","I'm an entrepreneur, a businessman. I've got a lot of money, and that doesn't go very well with the whole 'starving artist in a garret' routine.","The reason I don't carry a mobile phone is I don't want people to know where I am!","People think I'm just an old Luddite, but that's untrue. I buy every new gizmo as it comes out, play with it until I understand how it works, and then give it away.","I loathe and detest movies and television and don't watch any. I do not have the time.","I am a born-again atheist, so there isn't going to be a funeral. I will be buried in a linen wrap in a cardboard coffin in my forest with an oak tree planted on my head.","When I was young, I wanted to be the greatest blues singer of all time. I wrecked my education and left home for it.","The best thing about being immensely wealthy is not having to be in any particular place at any particular time doing a particular task you don't want to do.","I thoroughly object to getting old. If you could let me be 16 again, I'd give you everything I've got and everything I'll ever have.","I never sue journalists. I employ journalists. I employ too many of them. I don't sue journalists.","I only buy a computer when it's two years old, after the glitches have been worked out.","There are jobs, particularly database-oriented ones, for which computers are necessary, but for everyday office life, I question whether they have brought the productivity that their enormous cost, up to £10,000 per person, demands.","Computers are wasteful of paper and time. Once, we'd get documents with a few errors. Now, people make hundreds of copies until each sheet is flawless and memos are duplicated endlessly. Managers get swamped with emails.","The richer you are and the more financial advisers you employ, the less likelihood there is that you can ever discover what you are really worth.","The rich are not a contented tribe. The demands from others to share their wealth become so tiresome, so insistent, they often decide they must insulate themselves. Insulation eventually breeds a mild form of paranoia.","As with the onset of sudden celebrity, for the newly rich, the world often becomes a darker, narrower, less generous place; a paradox that elicits scant sympathy, but is nonetheless true.","There is never a time in a company's history when cost control can be relegated to the back burner, but for a startup company, keeping costs low is a vital necessity.","Overhead will eat you alive if not constantly viewed as a parasite to be exterminated. Never mind the bleating of those you employ. Hold out until mutiny is imminent before employing even a single additional member of staff. More startups are wrecked by overstaffing than by any other cause, bar failure to monitor cash flow.","Very, very few entrepreneurs who accept a 51 percent partner in a new venture will get rich if they are also expected to run it. Control is mandatory.","The vast majority of free verse is ghastly. Utterly ghastly. No one reads it. No one listens to it.","I hear poets complaining: 'We face what our forebears did not face. We face TV. We face radio. We face this and that.'","No woman or girl is going to want to spend time looking at pretty dresses on the Internet. Vogue is going to be around for a long time to come.","America is not the center of the universe.","'Great Expectations' has been described as 'Dickens's harshest indictment of society.' Which it is. After all, it's about money. About not having enough money; about the fever of the getting of money; about having too much money; about the taint of money.","Obviously, waste disposal is an enormous and fantastic industry.","America, ladies and gentlemen, has done more for me financially than Britain ever has, or ever could have done.","When you're writing, you're in a totally different zone... I can start a difficult poem and look up at the clock and see to my astonishment that three hours have passed.","I've been busy for years, buying land, often under pseudonyms, and planting trees on it. All the money is going into it when I die - and in the end I'd like to think that it will be 20 to 30,000 acres.","When I see something that's wrong, I just speak and act first and I'll take the consequences later.","Poetry is one of the oldest of all art forms, and one of its powers for shamans and tribal leaders was the mnemonic.","The planet doesn't require saving, and actually hasn't asked Greenpeace to save it.","The climate has been changing since there was a climate.","You can collect all the plastic bottle caps you want as long as you give me the money so we can get off this death trap, find somewhere else and have tremendous fun screwing that up as well.","I have one talent, and that's figuring out what people want about two minutes before they know it themselves.","I don't take investment advice from wealth managers. I have grown several businesses from scratch and amassed many millions from my publishing empire - why would I take advice from someone who has never experienced that?","Unless you are completely retired, earning money is the best form of wealth preservation.","Everything I publish is for my readers.","You cannot properly bring up children when you are 69 or 70 and they are 12 and at the height of their madness. You can physically do it, but I don't think it's morally justified.","Money is power. Power is an aphrodisiac.","People really do not have time to read all the newspapers in the world and all the sites that we now commonly use on the web. There is no possibility of keeping up.","I've always noted with some awe the reading habits of the Australian public. Australians read more newspapers and magazines per head of population than almost any other country in the world.","The problem with rich lists is... it is impossible to know what someone is worth until they have died and you have sold it.","I should have liked to get married, but over many decades I have lived essentially alone. I go to sleep when I'm tired, get up when I wake up, have my food prepared when I'm hungry. I can't bear the thought that I'd have to coincide, make an effort.","You can actually be bored stiff while you're dying.","I'm so suspicious of our own understanding of the past. I just think that your mind plays absolute tricks on you and fools you every minute of every day. And so when you're talking about the past, you're talking about something that never happened. At least it didn't happen the way you think it happened.","Posthumous reputations have little to do with real lives."],"Felix Feneon":["If Monsieur X spent an eternity studying treatises on optics, he would never paint 'La Grande Jatte.'","I aspire only to silence."],"Felix Frankfurter":["It is a wise man who said that there is no greater inequality than the equal treatment of unequals.","As a member of this court I am not justified in writing my private notions of policy into the Constitution, no matter how deeply I may cherish them or how mischievous I may deem their disregard.","Freedom of the press is not an end in itself but a means to the end of achieving a free society.","Judicial judgment must take deep account of the day before yesterday in order that yesterday may not paralyze today.","Wisdom too often never comes, and so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes late.","The history of liberty has largely been the history of the observance of procedural safeguards.","All our work, our whole life is a matter of semantics, because words are the tools with which we work, the material out of which laws are made, out of which the Constitution was written. Everything depends on our understanding of them.","It is a fair summary of history to say that the safeguards of liberty have been forged in controversies involving not very nice people.","To some lawyers, all facts are created equal.","Anybody can decide a question if only a single principle is in controversy.","Gratitude is one of the least articulate of the emotions, especially when it is deep.","Answers are not obtained by putting the wrong question and thereby begging the real one.","It is anomalous to hold that in order to convict a man the police cannot extract by force what is in his mind, but can extract what is in his stomach.","It must take account of what it decrees for today in order that today may not paralyze tomorrow.","The mode by which the inevitable is reached is effort.","I came into the world a Jew, and although I did not live my life entirely as a Jew, I think it is fitting that I should leave as a Jew.

He's likely to be not human enough.","The ultimate touchstone of constitutionality is the Constitution itself and not what we have said about it.","We forget that the most successful statesmen have been professionals. Lincoln was a professional politician.","The mark of a truly civilized man is confidence in the strength and security derived from the inquiring mind."],"Felix Hernandez":["Every year, you have to keep adjusting. I'm 28; I'm not 19 anymore. You have to work harder now.","When you work somewhere and you feel comfortable, you don't want to leave. You want to stay there forever.","I'm going to say this - to the people in Seattle, to all the people in Seattle that trust me, that believe in me - I'm going to say this: I'm not going to disappoint anybody.","I can't say anything I don't love about Seattle.","I don't want to be just an average guy. I want to do whatever possible to win a lot of games. I'm a competitor.","In '05, '06, '07 and '08, I wasn't throwing any changeups at all. Maybe two or three per game. In '09, I started playing with the grip, started throwing it in the bullpen and playing catch. It came out really good."],"Felix Klein":["Thus, in a sense, mathematics has been most advanced by those who distinguished themselves by intuition rather than by rigorous proofs.","Everyone knows what a curve is, until he has studied enough mathematics to become confused through the countless number of possible exceptions.","The greatest mathematicians, as Archimedes, Newton, and Gauss, always united theory and applications in equal measure.","The developing science departs at the same time more and more from its original scope and purpose and threatens to sacrifice its earlier unity and split into diverse branches."],"Felix Mendelssohn":["The essence of the beautiful is unity in variety.","Though everything else may appear shallow and repulsive, even the smallest task in music is so absorbing, and carries us so far away from town, country, earth, and all worldly things, that it is truly a blessed gift of God.","These seem to me so ambiguous, so vague, so easily misunderstood in comparison to genuine music, which fills the soul with a thousand things better than words.","Ever since I began to compose, I have remained true to my starting principle: not to write a page because no matter what public, or what pretty girl wanted it to be thus or thus; but to write solely as I myself thought best, and as it gave me pleasure.","People often complain that music is too ambiguous, that what they should think when they hear it is so unclear, whereas everyone understands words. With me, it is exactly the opposite, and not only with regard to an entire speech but also with individual words."],"Felix Rohatyn":["At its core, banking is not simply about profit, but about personal relationships.","The whole market mechanism and its evolution is something that, I'm kind of of the Buffett School. You know, if I see a derivative, I run the other way.","I am a capitalist and I believe in making a profit.","Investment banking is not a business; it is a personal service where bankers work hand in hand with their clients. And it is a service that must not simply be about making bigger and bigger deals that reap rewards for only a small group of executives.","In the 1970s, New York City avoided bankruptcy because wise political leaders like Gov. Hugh L. Carey believed both in strong labor unions and robust banks and companies.","The early years of my life were very, very traumatic. It was scary, because any child knew that death was sort of lurking around Europe as far as Jews were concerned.","Throughout U.S. history, competent public investments have been an essential complement to private investments - from the Louisiana Purchase, to land-grant colleges, to the Interstate Highway System, to the Internet."],"Felix de Weldon":["Well, it was one of my most gratifying experiences because I could devote my knowledge and my talent for the good for the City of Washington, and all the Federal projects where the Fine Arts Commission had jurisdiction, and it was a tremendous experience.","The early expression of my youth was filled with all the aspects of art.","I finished my studies in England, I opened my studio in London, and the first one-man exhibit I had on Bond Street, which was opened by the Austrian ambassador."],"Feng Zhang":["Brain cells are normally not sensitive to light. So by introducing light-sensitive proteins into specific types of neurons, we can now selectively control that specific type of neuron by shining light in the brain.","The ideal way to study the property of different types of neurons is to control individual types of cells independently and see what happens when you alter one type of cell. Optogenetics helps to realize this goal.","Studies by many labs have already started to identify specific circuits of neurons involved in normal cognitive function like memory and learning, as well as disease processes such as Parkinson's disease, depression, and autism.","There are still many challenges and questions that need to be addressed before optogenetics can be applied in humans for therapeutic uses.","There may be an evolutionary advantage for schizophrenia genes during famine.","If someone had protected the HTML language for making Web pages, then we wouldn't have the World Wide Web."],"Ferdinand Buisson":["From the day war conquered the skies, nothing could check its progress.","A human society obeys the dictates of reason and is guided and governed by a respect for justice.","For a long time, it was believed that war was waged by armies which could not be identified with the nation itself. Professional soldiers took upon themselves the job of defending national interests, and it was understood that the war affected only them; the country itself went on living and working.","We must not forget that chemical warfare will sooner or later bring in its wake bacteriological warfare, pest propagation, typhus and other serious diseases."],"Ferdinand Christian Baur":["It must inquire not merely about the circumstances of the time in general, but in particular about the writer's position with regard to these things, the interests and motives, the leading ideas of his literary activity.","It was my study of the two Corinthian letters that first caused me to concentrate my attention more directly on the relation of the apostle Paul to the older apostles.","The greater the conceptual significance of a literary product, the more it should be assumed that it is based on an idea that determines the whole, and that the deeper consciousness of the time to which it belongs is reflected in it.","Without philosophy, history is always for me dead and dumb."],"Ferdinand Foch":["The most powerful weapon on earth is the human soul on fire.","A battle won is a battle which we will not acknowledge to be lost.","My center is giving way, my right is in retreat; situation excellent.

I am for crossing the frontier.","There are many things we do not want about the world. Let us not just mourn them. Let us change them.","My life has been devoted to the upliftment of the Filipino by reestablishing his identity and dignity.","I do not care how brave a president is; I do not care how many medals he may wear. I do not care how well trained his guards may be. If he violates the will of the people, he shall be eliminated.","I'll take my destiny, whatever that may be, but I'm going to fight for my dignity and my honor.","History should not be left to the historians.

And acting alone, accept everything alone.","Whatever be the challenges, whatever be the obstacles before us, I say to you as I say to everybody else that we will overcome.","Nobody is impervious to misfortune.","The one indisputable reality of dictatorship is that dissent, insult, and malevolent language do not go unpunished if it is allowed at all.","I am ashamed to run against a lady. It's demeaning, very degrading. I have always refused to argue with a lady.","We dare not supress thoughts, but when they are expressed through violence, like the idea that power comes from the barrel of a gun, they must be dealt with and met accordingly.","Filipinos are not worse than any other colonized people except that our colonization was a little longer, and the independence movement was always dictated in political terms, never in social ones. We borrowed terms, but we didn't understand them.","We have no quarrel with a policy that seeks to support human rights.","My friends in the opposition have forgotten that the constitution of the Philippines was amended in 1973 with their participation. The constitution mandates the administration, including the Batasan, or legislature, to convert slowly into a semiparliamentary form of government. The president in such a situation can issue decrees and edicts.","We do not postpone the participation of the lower classes of our people in the profits of economic enterprise, and in other countries, they do postpone it. In the long run, I think our policy is better, and we stand by it.","America must realize, there are conditions she must accept in Asia. The first is a diversity of Asian cultures, governments, economic and political systems; the second, that to run against the tide of Asian nationalism is worse than impractical - it is also highly dangerous.","I was deposed by a coup d'etat, by friends that I trusted and aided by the American Government.","The U.S. State Department has a consistent record of error in the assessment of Asian situations and judging Red Chinese intentions.","What we ask of the developed countries is to let the Third World find a third way.","The primary problem in many modernizing societies is not liberty but the creation of a legitimate public order.

There is a dialogue.","These statements about torture, about alleged misuse of power and things like that, insulted the Filipinos more than their leader because it was made to appear as if Filipinos would tolerate a leader who would torture his own people, who would utilize his executive prerogatives for abuses.","I would like to see whether my supposed successors can really operate the government without causing a crisis.","I have been called brave in my time, but brave as I may have been against foreign invaders, I have no heart to shed Filipino blood.","The challenge to America is to extend to Asia the defensive shield of American power in forms consonant with Asian freedom and self-respect.","The challenge to Asia is to discard the dry, meatless bone of mysticism and fatalism.","The permissiveness of society must be balanced with authoritativeness.","I can understand the Cultural Revolution of Mao Tse-tung.","Filipino talents and skills are becoming ubiquitous in many parts of the world.

However, this is in no way connected with the indispensability of the existence of the family.","Something is happening to Britain and the British. Or has happened. We are said to be passing through a transition, or a turning point, or a transformation; nobody is quite sure which.","The president is being denounced for not taking the kind of pre-emptive action in Afghanistan that he has been so passionately denounced for taking in Iraq. Damned if he does and damned if he doesn't.","We are also further than ever from equality of opportunity.","We criticize, copy, patronize, idolize and insult but we never doubt that the U.S. has a unique position in the history of human hopes.","We want a system that will improve consistency and steadiness in the quality of government.","What the world needs now is more Americans.

But not yet in the spirit of linguistics.","A linguistic system is a series of differences of sound combined with a series of differences of ideas.","The critical principle demanded an examination, for instance, of the contribution of different periods, thus to some extent embarking on historical linguistics.","Everyone, left to his own devices, forms an idea about what goes on in language which is very far from the truth.","It is one of the aims of linguistics to define itself, to recognise what belongs within its domain. In those cases where it relies upon psychology, it will do so indirectly, remaining independent.","In fact, from then on scholars engaged in a kind of game of comparing different Indo-European languages with one another, and eventually they could not fail to wonder what exactly these connections showed, and how they should be interpreted in concrete terms.","Linguistics will have to recognise laws operating universally in language, and in a strictly rational manner, separating general phenomena from those restricted to one branch of languages or another.","Any psychology of sign systems will be part of social psychology - that is to say, will be exclusively social; it will involve the same psychology as is applicable in the case of languages.","It is useful to the historian, among others, to be able to see the commonest forms of different phenomena, whether phonetic, morphological or other, and how language lives, carries on and changes over time.","It is only since linguistics has become more aware of its object of study, i.e. perceives the whole extent of it, that it is evident that this science can make a contribution to a range of studies that will be of interest to almost anyone.","The business, task or object of the scientific study of languages will if possible be 1) to trace the history of all known languages. Naturally this is possible only to a very limited extent and for very few languages.","The first of these phases is that of grammar, invented by the Greeks and carried on unchanged by the French. It never had any philosophical view of a language as such.","The very special place that a language occupies among institutions is undeniable, but there is much more to be said-, a comparison would tend rather to bring out the differences.","Whitney wanted to eradicate the idea that in the case of a language we are dealing with a natural faculty; in fact, social institutions stand opposed to natural institutions.","Within speech, words are subject to a kind of relation that is independent of the first and based on their linkage: these are syntagmatic relations, of which I have spoken."],"Ferdowsi":["Helmet was joined to helmet, and spear to spear, and jewels, baggage, and elephants without number went with them, and you would have said it was a host that none could understand.","And the blood of brave men was shed like unto the shedding of rain from a black cloud.","Now when the two armies met, many and fierce were the combats waged between them, and blows were given and received, and swords flashed and showers of arrows descended on all sides.","How shall a man escape from that which is written; How shall he flee from his destiny?","And now may the blessing of God rest upon all men.

I wasn't being myself. What I should have done was say. 'Girls, it's really time for me to go on my own. I need to fulfill this dream of mine to have a solo album.' And I didn't know how to do that. I wanted to please them.","There were periods of my life when a lot of people didn't believe in me. I still had faith in myself. I really had to ask myself life questions. Where do I see myself in five years? Create a ladder for yourself, and walk up the steps. Climb that ladder.","I have my team. Like if you see everyone around me - I have my hair and makeup girl, my assistant. They're very calm, they're all about positive energy. There're no drama queens. Everyone wants everyone else to have a positive experience. There are no agendas. I think it creates a healthy environment and there are no boundaries to cross.","It's cool to express myself, but I've had to learn that doing interviews isn't completely therapy - spilling everything about yourself isn't healthy all the time. But I've been through things that have made me a stronger person, and if I can help some people, I will.","Wearing nice lingerie makes me feel really glamorous. I love to splurge on that.","I love diamond facials - they leave me glowing and refreshed.","You'd be surprised how addicting high self-esteem is.","I was a child actor. I was this spaz kid diagnosed with ADHD, and I worked all the time.","I'm famous for splurging at fast-food places. I'm currently obsessed with Taco Bell's bean and cheese burritos with extra green sauce and extra cheese. Gluttony!","For me, it's not about price. It's about necessity, quality, and usefulness.

Avon's Advance Techniques Damage Repair 3D Rescue Leave-In Treatment makes it look and feel healthier.","I use the Clarisonic electronic skin cleansing system. It's great for removing excess oil and make-up and leaves my face feeling really smooth and clean. Then I apply Avon Anew Rejuvenate Day Revitalising Cream and Creme de la Mer Eye Concentrate. I think eye cream is so important - it keeps me looking young and prevents wrinkles.","I don't miss being on the road right now because the thing is, I was on the road for eight years, so I love pizza, but pizza every day for eight years is a different thing.","For me, I'm not a jealous person.

And it's about trying the food, and really experiencing it.","I'm very ambitious, but I also love myself - which means I try to take care of myself.","I've already got notebooks full of ideas for new music, so I'm gonna kind of nurture that just like I do all of my ideas and perfect it until it's ready and then I'll just let it go.","Part of my affinity with urban music comes from being on 'Kids Incorporated,' 'cos we used to sit around and listen to Chaka Khan and Prince, and I got influenced by all that. Then gangsta rap got started, and I was infatuated with that - maybe that's why I'm fascinated by guns.","Guns are beautiful. But I don't like what they do.","I've learned to suck in my stomach when photographers are around. I used to read gossip magazines all the time, but I stopped when I started being written about in them and read incredible lies about myself.","I love crying at romantic movies like 'The Notebook.' I'm always bawling.","I don't want to have a song like 'My Humps' and it be sagging down, so I pay attention to that area. A lot.","I've been working straight since 2003, so I might just want to take an improv or theater class. That excites me. I can't wait to do different characters - not necessarily the leading chick who gets the guy, but the weird, freaky cousin.","I'm going through an evolution. I'm completely cleaning out my closet. I'm purging, because I saw that show 'Hoarders.' I had a sweatshirt from sixth grade, and I'm going, 'Why do I hold on to this?'","Grades were important in our house. I was reading by two. My mom would sit there and read with me, read with me, read with me. It was wonderful.","I'm very close with my higher power. I have a very strong connection with it.","So many songs are just a wink to the audience, but people take them seriously. 'My Humps?' C'mon!","The electro scene is all over the clubs now: groups like Duck Sauce, Empire of the Sun, even MGMT. But I get inspiration from everywhere. I'll go to the gym and put on old albums - Guns N' Roses or old Jay-Z.","There are so many different people that I've emulated vocally. In the rock world - Sebastian Bach, Vince Neil, Freddie Mercury, Robert Plant. They all had amazing vocal talent.","As far as female vocalists, I love Heart, Joan Jett, Courtney Love, Laura Branigan, Linda Ronstadt, Barbra Streisand - or going back to when I was a child, Aileen Quinn, the original Annie.","For me, healthy eating and exercising is something I work on constantly. I'm not the most disciplined dieter. I try to eat a lot of fruit and vegetables but sometimes late at night I tend to have fast-food meals - and that's where I get myself into trouble! So I'm not in the best shape I could be, but I'm still healthy and comfy.","I'm a big online everything. But for me, shopping online started with music, obviously, then it went onto books, meditation CDs, and I just recently bought these electronic cigarettes. My husband is trying to quit smoking, so I went online and I bought those BluCigs cigarettes in every flavor for him.","Luckily I don't have to buy shoes anymore, because I design them! I'm off tour, so I can dive in and create the shoes that I want for my line. But okay, I did buy a pair of vintage combat boots because they were so beaten up - I had to have them.","I know this sounds generic, but I'm so happy to be home with my husband, my family, and my dog.","What happens when you're a child professional is that you have to be, well, professional. You're taught not to have tantrums, to always people-please.","I'm trying to get a thicker skin. I like to be aware of people's perceptions of me, but when you put it as a priority, as a means to judging your worth, that's when it can be dangerous.","I love Nelly. He's such a great performer. He's so hyper and so am I.","Dick Clark will be truly missed. We will carry on his legacy every New Year's Eve.","Right now I'm reading every fashion magazine I can find. As a shoe designer, I feel it's my responsibility to learn as much as I can about the business, past and present.","I call my therapist every other day. It's not a one-stop shop. You have to push away all that negativity in your head. Face it, name it, let it go.","I love black truffles. I love white truffles.","I'm glad that our music motivates people to exercise. If I had to pick just one song to run to, it would be 'Violet' by Hole. It makes me want to run.","I have to wear two sports bras when I do my cardio. It takes a lot to hold these puppies up!","Once I have children, the kids come first. One thing at a time for me.","I try to work out with my personal trainer for an hour, four times a week - we mainly concentrate on weights and running. If I'm on the road I sometimes do DVD work-outs in my hotel room - P90X and Insanity are a couple of my favourites.","I needed to take a break from performing, and from the Peas, to be happy. I craved female time, and time with my husband to feed my soul. My life now is about being balanced. I'm passionate about work and working out, seeing friends and family, and letting my hair down once in a while.","Men scream and go crazy in the gym. I'm a silent workout partner, but when my adrenaline gets up, I talk trash.","I've learned to be more accepting of myself. I'm 37, not 18, and I've got the lines to prove it. I try to remind myself that a girl can have it all, just not all at once.","There is so much to do in my house, in every little corner. It's just like anybody, it's like one step at a time. I try to decorate one space and a pipe breaks or whatever - you know how it is."],"Fergus Henderson":["Ambition drives you on, ability certainly helps, but the fickle finger of fate and luck are great things.","Porridge and the urban lifestyle don't mix well.","I'm a big believer that we get the politicians we deserve.","We live in a flat; my wife would be happy if we had a house with stairs. Or a little cottage in the country.","I'm like a kid in a sweet shop every day. It's slightly cringey how much fun I have.","Do not let the word 'tripe' deter you. Let its soothing charms win you over, and enjoy it as do those who always have!","I had a holiday job in a kitchen, but I think we'll draw a polite veil over that. There was nothing joyous or creative about it. And none of this helped my studies.","My first proper kitchen was this funny little club that we set up in Mercer Street in Covent Garden. It got shut down. Then I worked at a club in Notting Hill.","A pig's trotter is a fantastic thing. The first night of my honeymoon in Paris, my wife fell asleep in her steak tartare, so my trotter kept me company.","Nose-to-tail eating is not a bloodlust, testosterone-fueled offal hunt. It's common sense, and it's all good stuff.","I feel good when I stir something with a spurtle, but I don't make porridge very much in London.","I think tripe is maligned. It's wonderful stuff, but everyone goes 'urgh.' You have to wash and then cook it, very gently braise it, for eight hours. It uplifts you but steadies you at the same time.","I think Isambard Kingdom Brunel would be a good chap to have supper with. Anyone who builds a railway and then builds a steamship when he gets to Bristol and can't go any further must be a good chap.","I've probably got lots of heroes. One is a chap called Charles Campbell - he is a wonderful chap. We cooked together in a nightclub in Notting Hill. He told me brilliant stories of food and life and generally put me on the right track.","I cook British food, but it doesn't mean I'm jingoistic about it. People can cook very good fusion food.","What worries me is that, because of the amount of media coverage of food, Britain seems to have become a foodie nation - but I'm not sure it actually has. I'm not sure there's been a huge change in the pantry at home or what we cook for supper."],"Ferguson Jenkins":["Mental attitude and concentration are the keys to pitching.","I would love to see as many of the black players as possible in today's Major League Baseball make every effort to go to the Negro Leagues Museum and get a first-hand view of how it all started.","All of the charities we're involved with have touched me in one way or another on a personal level. There are about eight or nine charities that I support."],"Ferid Murad":["The restaurant business had a profound effect on my future and that of my two brothers. When we were able to stand on a stool to reach the sink, we washed dishes, and later, when we could see over the counter, we waited tables and managed the cash register.","The childhood poverty of both my parents and their minimal education did much to influence me and my two younger brothers in our education and career choices. One brother became a dentist and the other, a professor of anthropology with a Ph.D. degree.","My parents always encouraged us to get an education and establish a profession. However, my brothers and I grew up with considerable freedom, whether it was saving or spending our tips from the restaurant or our career choices.","Grade school, middle school and high school were relatively easy for me, and with little studying, I was an honor student every semester, graduating 5th in my high school class.","I am not surprised that other gases may participate in cellular signaling and regulation. Our early work with nitric oxide was just the beginning. I'm sure more will be discovered.","Nitric oxide was known for destroying things.","There are very few things in the body that nitric oxide doesn't regulate.","I knew I wanted considerable education so that I wouldn't have to work as hard as my parents.","What does that suggest when a compound this simple plays such an important role? To me it suggests that nitric oxide is one of the most primitive elements of cellular signaling, that it goes way back into evolution."],"Fernand Braudel":["History may be divided into three movements: what moves rapidly, what moves slowly and what appears not to move at all.","Everything must be recaptured and relocated in the general framework of history, so that despite the difficulties, the fundamental paradoxes and contradictions, we may respect the unity of history which is also the unity of life."],"Fernand Leger":["Man needs colour to live; it's just as necessary an element as fire and water.","Enormous enlargements of an object or a fragment give it a personality it never had before, and in this way, it can become a vehicle of entirely new lyric and plastic power.","What does that represent? There was never any question in plastic art, in poetry, in music, of representing anything. It is a matter of making something beautiful, moving, or dramatic - this is by no means the same thing.","The realistic value of a work is completely independent of its properties in terms of content.","This truth must be recognized as a dogma and assume the validity of an axiom in the general understanding of painting."],"Fernando Alonso":["I have always been very calm on the outside. I'm not too stressed now just because I'm in formula one. For me, tomorrow will be another day whether I finish first or last. I have to do the maximum and I cannot ask any more from myself.","Ferrari gives you a special feeling.","I look at myself as someone who has been very lucky - my job is also what I enjoy most in the world, and I can make my life doing it.","I like to race, not to do laps alone.","For me it's a simple sport and a simple way to live these seven or eight years of maximum sport.","Creating a top team and being in a position to win the Tour de France will give me a nice feeling. But I know it is not easy to create a top team from zero. You need good riders, good staff, a lot of preparation and, most important, a lot of sponsors.","After five years in Ferrari, being second all the time, I think it was enough for me.","I like America, and I think probably the American people like me.","I am very proud of what we have built in Spain, because it is not a traditional Formula 1 country. I think we have found passionate fans, and built up a strong culture for the sport - and things are improving every day, with more and more people getting interested.","For me, it was not destiny to make it to where I am now - I thought for a long- time I would become a go-kart mechanic, or a job like this, not an F1 driver.","In Spain there were no TV rights for Formula One.","When I race in Australia or Korea or Japan I know it will be a big change for me because Ferrari fans are worldwide.","If you're in the best team in the world, you or your teammate have to win.","When I race in Australia or Korea or Japan, I know it will be a big change for me because Ferrari fans are worldwide. It's very nice if you win, but it's not so good if you lose. All this is part of being a Ferrari driver.","McLaren was a risky project because they were completely new, but we are one team - we win and we lose together.","With Ferrari sometimes, you win or you lose depending on what the mood of the team in general, of the group in general."],"Fernando Botero":["Sketching is almost everything. It is the painter's identity, his style, his conviction, and then color is just a gift to the drawing.","There's nothing more superficial to do than to paint a beautiful woman. The most beautiful portraits in art were of ugly women. If you paint Brigitte Bardot, it's a disaster. Sunsets, you have to stay away from sunsets. You paint a sunset, you are in great danger.","My work is a self-portrait of my mind, a prism of my convictions.","The circus allows one to be logical and unreal at the same time. In the circus, all is possible: there can be a man with two heads or a character with a green face.","Art should be an oasis: a place or refuge from the hardness of life.","All my life, my girlfriends are always skinny. Beauty in art has nothing to do with beauty in reality. Why do you like primitive art? Because there is beauty in the deformity. Sometimes paintings that people consider realistic are not at all. Raphael figures look realistic, but in real life, they were deformed.","My popularity has to do with the divorce between modern art, where everything is obscure, and the viewer who often feels he needs a professor to tell them whether it's good or not. I believe a painting has to talk directly to the viewer, with composition, color and design, without a professor to explain it.","The only duty an artist has is in the quality of the art. There is no moral obligation to denounce. An artist confronted with a tremendous injustice sometimes feels inclined to say something. Denouncing the situation is the artist's choice.","The circus leaves a sweet memory.","Art is always an exaggeration in some sense; in color, in form, even in theme, etc... but it has always been this way. It is the same with the nature of some works by Giotto or Massacio, or the color of life as expressed by Van Gogh.","I'm the most Colombian of the Colombians, even though I've lived 47 years outside of Colombia. I've lived 13 years in New York, and I never did a painting about New York. I've lived in France more than 30 years, and I've never painted Paris.","You paint what you know best; what you went through as a teenager and child. My world is the one I got to know in Medellin; I never paint anything else other than that.","All the animals I've painted always have a relationship with man. I have been told that part of the knowledge of the human anatomy comes from animals.","An artist is attracted to certain kinds of form without knowing why. You adopt a position intuitively; only later do you attempt to rationalize or even justify it.","Art is important because when people start to forget, art reminds them what happened. Like 'Guernica.' People would not remember the tragedy of Guernica today if it were not for that painting.","Bullfights are a very cultural thing. I know many people think it's cruel, but so many things are cruel. Hunting, the electric chair, wars. These are all cruel things as well.","Expression without culture is flat. Many artists come out of art school and start doing things that don't last. They are audacious because of ignorance. They are irresponsible.","I have seen Colonial churches since I was very small, Colonial painting and polychrome sculpture. And that was all I saw. There was not a single modern painting in any museum, not a Picasso, not a Braque, not a Chagall. The museums had Colombian painters from the eighteenth century and, of course, I saw Pre-Columbian art. That was my exposure.","I often think about death, and it saddens me to leave this world and not be able to paint more. I love it so much.","I love art so much because of curiosity. At the start of a painting, I know 10 percent of what the painting will be, and then I have to improvise the whole thing.","I had wanted to be a sculptor throughout life, but to do so, I had to stop painting.","I follow politics very closely. I read several newspapers every day.","In a photo, you just do a click, but in art you have to put in so much energy. This concentration of energy and attention says something that other media cannot say.","In the '60s, I did many satirical portraits of dictators.","An artist is born like a priest is born. If they are born an artist, I would tell them art is not a game: it is something very serious which completely requires everything you have to give.","People say, 'What a discipline, painting so much.' I say, 'No, I love it.' Nothing amuses me as much as my work. To have discipline would be not to paint.","I love my country, and it hurts not to be able to see my country, as I did for so many years. I hope that I will one day be able to live in a peaceful Colombia.","I had an uncle who took me to the ring in Medellin when I was 15 years old. In school, we had someone who taught us how to bullfight.","Before anything else, I started painting bulls and matadors. That was my initiation to paint.","Bullfights have so much color. Not just the matador but also the bull, the arena, and the public. It's all very festive.","Nobody ever told me, 'Art is this.' This was good luck in a way because I would have had to spend half of my life forgetting everything that I had been told, which is what happens with most students in schools of fine arts.","I was drawing a mandolin, and I made the sound hole very small, which made the mandolin look gigantic. I saw that making the details small made the form monumental. So in my figures, the eyes, the mouth are all small, and the exterior form is huge.","I have the sensation of doing something good for people, more than being a trendy artist or a successful artist.","I believe that it's better to have a conviction, believe strongly in something, and then the convictions create a style that reflects your mentality.","The circus is a global theme. It exists in all parts of the world - maybe not in Africa, but it exists in Asia in all parts. In Latin America, it's difficult to find a person who hasn't gone to the circus."],"Fernando Flores":["Great work is done by people who are not afraid to be great.","Our worst comes out when we behave like robots or professionals.","I made my own assessment of my life, and I began to live it. That was freedom.","Our best comes out when we have honest discussions.","But every company of the future is going to be in the business of exquisite care - which means quick turnaround time and convenience. To deliver exquisite care, you need an organization that coordinates well and listens well.","Hope is the raw material of losers.","I never told a victim story about my imprisonment. Instead, I told a transformation story - about how prison changed my outlook, about how I saw that communication, truth, and trust are at the heart of power.","You have one big mythology in your favor: Everyone believes that you Europeans are impeccable. But I know you are jerks.","When trust improves, the mood improves.","A feel-good style can be a symptom of unawareness or lack of caring.","When I left prison, I had to figure out how to embrace my past.","I never blamed Pinochet, or my torturers, or external circumstances.","You have to be able to risk your identity for a bigger future than the present you are living.","That's why we're doing this, to defend our traditions a little. I don't have anything against it (Halloween), but it's not our tradition."],"Fernando Lamas":["You look marvelous!","It is better to look good than to feel good."],"Fernando Pessoa":["Wise is he who enjoys the show offered by the world.","At first, it's unfamiliar, then it strikes root.","All is worthwhile if the soul is not small.","To choose ways of not acting was ever the concern and scruple of my life.","Success consists in being successful, not in having potential for success. Any wide piece of ground is the potential site of a palace, but there's no palace till it's built.","Look, there's no metaphysics on earth like chocolates.","Could it think, the heart would stop beating.","No intelligent idea can gain general acceptance unless some stupidity is mixed in with it.","To feel today what one felt yesterday isn't to feel - it's to remember today what was felt yesterday, to be today's living corpse of what yesterday was lived and lost."],"Fernando Torres":["Real Madrid is like Manchester United or Liverpool or Bayern Munich. There is so much history, and you need to play and win against that history. It's difficult to play against them because you fight against everything - the history, the players - but because of that, the motivation is always so high.","Football is a team sport and not an individual sport. We win as a team, and every individual is better if we are part of the team.","I was not a Liverpool fan or a Chelsea fan in Madrid. I was an Atletico fan. I still am. Maybe they're the only badge I will kiss.","In your life, you go through a difficult situation or a very good situation, and you have different moods, but you learn things from your experiences.","Domestic titles are very important, but to win the Champions League, you are saying, 'We are the best team in Europe.'","You have to prove yourself every day. You have to live for today.","It's not easy to come somewhere new and have to find your place. You might feel someone doesn't like you, or you might need to find new friends. It's not easy, and I don't like this kind of thing. It's not easy, so you want to protect the players who are alone.","You have to know what club you are playing for, or you just play for yourself. Every time I put on a Liverpool shirt, I know it is more than just a football game.","Fitness is important, but the most important thing is how you adapt and the way you feel physically. To adapt to a new position. To try to change your game.","Everything I have done in my career I have done from my values and doing things the way I like to do. So winning doesn't matter the world for me.","You can have a contract that is better than your friends, but no player looks back and says, 'I won more money.'","When I was a child, my dream was to play for Atletico.","At Liverpool, I had almost everything but titles. I felt like a king, but the team was falling apart.","I always live in the present. I never dream about what might happen. Why? It might not.","If the manager thinks there is another player better than you, he is going to play, and this is the way. You have to try to improve and keep fighting and try to change the manager's mind.","I'm a quiet guy, but on the pitch, it's different. You have to do everything you can to win and help your teammates.","I want to say thanks to the Chelsea fans because I have seen them very, very happy with me for joining Chelsea.","My only path has always been to work hard.","Nobody has ever gifted me anything.","English football has an enormous following across the world, not just because of the players but because of its history, its tradition, the excitement, the capacity crowds.","In the dressing room, you can never lose that group concept.","Liverpool is a massive club in reputation, but as soon as I came here, it felt like Atletico to me. It is a working city, an honest city. The people work all week, and on Saturday they want to go to Anfield and watch the best team in the world.","Chelsea gave me all the trophies I have as a football player. I saw my kids growing up in London.","I didn't realise how my life was changing. When I was 17, 18, 20, I didn't realise how big football was and everything around football. How many people live for football and love football. I was a professional, but I was a supporter.","The Premier League is very difficult football and very different to when you play in Europe, but the player has to have experience to adapt, and this is the key point.","I am a big fan of the Gallagher brothers. At Liverpool, they came a few times; they are friends of Steven Gerrard. It was nice to meet them. When I was in Spain, I couldn't speak English, so I couldn't understand the lyrics. When I came to England, I started studying music and trying to understand what my favourite songs said.","When I retire, the only thing that concerns me is that no one can say that I was a bad team-mate or disrespectful or self-important.","Liverpool is a fundamental part of my life. They don't remember me that way, but time will change that. I could not have chosen a better place to go when I left Atletico.","My son is a Liverpool fan, and he was already kicking a ball before he was one. He was born in the football city; he had no choice.","The Champions League is a big ambition, and all the footballers want to play in it; it is a very important competition.","Madrid is not as big as London, but it is true when you are coming from a big city like Madrid, nothing is going to surprise you, and I am very happy to move to a city like London. It is a big city, and you can do everything you want with the respect that the English people always have.","I was captain in Atletico at 19, playing in the same team as Demetrio Albertini, who won three Champions Leagues, and Sergi Barjuan from Barcelona, who had won everything, and they were 32, 33. I was a kid as captain, so I wasn't the real captain, just a kid learning from them.","I remember when I first came to Liverpool, Pepe Reina helped with everything, and he made it easy for me. When I was Atletico Madrid captain, I tried to help everyone. These are the basics in football: you need to create an atmosphere and try to create a group of friends. It's not easy, and it doesn't always happen, but you have to try.","The biggest ambition in my career is still to win the European Cup. I want to have a picture of that to look at later; I want to have that medal. You can have a contract that is better than your friends, but no player looks back and says: 'I won more money.'","One of the reasons I chose to come to Liverpool was because of the mentality of the club. It's a working club and a working city. I don't know why, but I feel like one of the people here. They recognise me and wish me luck, but in Spain, they surround you and you can't do anything. I think they're happy with me here.","My baby will be growing up in Liverpool, so we have another Scouser.","After winning the European Championship with Spain, I know exactly how it feels to win a major trophy, and I know that, if we can win at Liverpool, it will feel the same or even better than it did with Spain.","The things you cannot change you can't waste your time on.","Messi is the best. I have not seen or will ever see a player like Lionel Messi.","When young players become one of the best in the world, everyone wants to sign them.","If we win the Champions League, everyone is a better, more recognised player, but if you win an individual award and nothing with your team, it means nothing.","You have to win with the team and for the team.","If we win trophies, we have the chance to win individual awards because it comes with the team targets.","Steven Gerrard is the best player I have played with throughout my career; therefore, my ideal player would be very like him.","I can be very shy. I really like to stay at home with my people because I'm really shy. My wife is as well; we're both really shy.","I like to play. It doesn't matter if it's just me up front on my own or alongside another striker. I always want to play in the first XI.","I was always fighting with everyone when I was a kid. I was playing with people two or three years older than me, and I had to survive. So I love the physical game, the contact. And I don't know why, but I think football is like this. It is not just touching the ball and stringing together 50 pretty passes consecutively.","Big clubs in Europe always go through difficult spells where it appears as though there is no light at the end of the tunnel. But because they are big clubs, they always come back, and they do so with a vengeance.","For me, Real Madrid are just like any other club, like Barcelona, Milan, Bayern Munich, or Inter. Just another big club.","I just do not see myself playing for Madrid. They do not attract me, especially because of my past with Atletico.","Ronaldo is different from Messi. He is very impressive down the wings.","When you play, you do not ask yourself how it feels to be on the bench. You have to live it to understand how difficult it is to be there without being there. To enter a match knowing you do not have the confidence of the coach. To play when you simply don't have the habit of playing.","A player wants to be remembered for what he has won, for the medals, for what he has given his club.","It was very hard to go through life as a small boy supporting Atletico.","My father worked every day; my brother and sister had to travel many hours to study, so Atletico were for people like us.","I left in Liverpool a lot of friends. I have a very good relationship with all of them.","The Premier League is tough because, as soon as you lose a couple of games, you're out of the race for the league.","You always have to aspire to everything; winning titles is what I've been missing. And I will give my life and everything I have in order to achieve it.","Atleti fans always demand your all on the field, and I guarantee that I will give them that and more.","I want to thank my two English clubs: Liverpool for bringing me to the Premier League and Chelsea for the trophies I won.","No one has given me anything for free.","I don't want to imagine the time when I have to stop playing.","Winning the European Championship was a great thing for me, and I understood what it was to win a major trophy and what I had been missing.","The worst part about not playing is when you think that you are ready to do it. You try to get more minutes, taking the chances, but you end up in a situation where things have not gone well for you for weeks - or for years. That is like swimming wet clothes.","When I was a boy, I was really thin, small, long-haired. I always looked young. People thought, 'He can't play football.' I used that to my advantage.","Each player has one place in the world where he is happy, and as a result, he plays well. My place is Anfield. Every game I can play there, I feel good.","As a kid, I never once dreamt of playing for Liverpool.","I have good memories and bad memories of games against Chelsea. All the goals are good memories because all of them are special.","When I played against Chelsea, there was always a big motivation because it was a special game; it was always one of the biggest games of the season. This is one of the reasons why I wanted to join Chelsea: because I want to be part of this kind of team.","Football is not a sport populated by honest people. You can't tell the truth or be up front with people. It's a business, and no one is friends.","I had the best three years of my career at Liverpool.","Liverpool gave me a second home. I was 24, I left my team, my town, and I went there. My memories there are just amazing. I have no words to thank them enough, and that's why I will always be a fan.","The MLS is a fantastic competition, and it is growing all the time.","I had team-mates who didn't care if the team won or lost because they were not playing. I never wanted to be like that.","I learnt that if we won, it didn't matter that I hadn't played. I had to keep working.","I am a professional, and I always fulfil my deals.","Liverpool had a lot of success under Rafa Benitez, and that is difficult for anyone to follow.","At Liverpool, winning is customary."],"Ferran Adria":["Everywhere the sky is blue. There are a multitude of cuisines and dishes. I think of them as the languages and dialects of food.","I have a driver's licence, but the truth is that I hardly ever drive. I prefer to get around by taxi.","I never even dreamed of being a chef, and that's fundamental.","I don't worry about the things I can't change.","I wanted to take nouvelle cuisine further, to the point where we were breaking down the essence of taste and sensation, reconfiguring food as a series of really intense hits on the tongue.","Innovation, being avant garde, is always polemic.","Why not mix this and that? If soy goes well with fish, how come no one does beef carpaccio with soy? Why do we have such a taste and not another? It's all about culture. There is something, however, that I really don't like: bell peppers.","Risk is to do something that 99 percent of the time would be a failure.","When we're ill, one of the last things we have that we can enjoy is food.","I am not a multimillionaire. I don't own a yacht or a Ferrari. I live in a 60-square- metre flat. My needs are simple.","If a child plays sport early in childhood, and doesn't give it up, he will play sport for the rest of his life. And if children have a connection with, and are involved in the preparation of, the food they eat, then it will be normal for them to cook these kind of meals, and they will go on cooking them for the rest of their lives.","I believe that if you eat well, you work even better.","I was 18 when I first started working at a restaurant. I was a dishwasher. I only got the job because I wanted to go to Ibiza for vacation, and washing dishes was the only job I could find.","Friends are really important, especially when you've had the successes that I've had. I've gone really far in my career, so they're the ones that keep you humble, keep your feet on the ground.","I don't read books regularly, because I'm always writing them. I've written 30 books, thousands of pages.","I cook more theoretically than I do practically. My job is creative, and in the kitchen, the biggest part of my creativity is theoretical.","In a city, it's very hard to do a restaurant, an avant-garde-cuisine restaurant, where each year you need to change the whole menu.","We never have business meals at El Bulli. If it's about business, you're probably not paying much attention to the food.","If I were a customer, and I was given a dish with peppers, I would hate it. I also don't like blood sausage.","It's very hard to be an innovator at the highest level in any discipline. For some chefs it's merely about combining ingredients, but that's something you can do with your eyes closed.","When people arrive at El Bulli, everybody goes through the kitchen. It's a way of making them feel at home. When they leave, the only thing I ask is whether they've been happy. Everything in between, I don't particularly care.","For me to go to a restaurant and eat something that is not only good, but totally new, is a double thrill. Double the enjoyment.","When I was a teenager, my idol was the Dutch footballer Johan Cruyff. He's the only person I've ever asked for an autograph.","I don't dream at night; life has given me the stuff I need to be able to dream during the day. I'm very lucky.","I had a very normal childhood, and my mother cooked very normal food.","I can't live without activity; I can't be sedentary.","Monkeys don't enjoy or appreciate flavours. Experts have told us that human beings are the only beings that can appreciate food at this higher level and the only living beings that cook.","There are many cultural prejudices. For instance, even though fresh fish is a regional staple, Catalans don't like sashimi.","Just to eat is a gift.","Ferran Adria making hamburgers... some thought it was crazy. But getting them perfect was a challenge. Plus I'm fascinated by all aspects of food.","Chefs have only been able to work in restaurants, high-end cuisine. Why? Why haven't they been able to find other scenarios? For those chefs who want to do avant-garde cuisine, should they be finding their income in a restaurant?","When you talk about avant-garde cuisine, the surprise factor is really important. For example, I love looking at blogs and the photos, but I'm not that keen on other people taking photos of my dishes."],"Fetty Wap":["My whole thing is loyalty. Loyalty over royalty; word is bond.","I am my own mentor. I like to listen to myself to improve.","I got my own sound; nobody sounds like me.","When you really work hard for something that you genuinely and truly love, and you don't want it to fail, it's a good feeling to see it do good.","When I was little, I got into a little accident, and it gave me congenital glaucoma in both of my eyes.","I never really thought I was going to be a singer, honestly. I never listened to singers; I always listened to rap music.","Don't let nobody tell you that you can't do it. Love what you do until you don't love it anymore. Nothing's impossible.","Plans never go well for me. I just live every day like I ain't gonna live the next one.","It takes a lot of people hours to make music because they focus so much on one thing. I just do it, and I make something you can just vibe to.","There's a lot of females that hustle, just like men hustle.","When I go to clubs, I don't have to wait outside.","Gucci Mane is my favorite artist.","I never thought I was going to leave the trap. I even told my mother, 'I'm gonna be the trap God.'","There's gonna be a lot of great songs, but there ain't going to be another 'Trap Queen.'","I just want everybody to know my music and get to know my squad, Remy Boyz; just to show people New Jersey. New Jersey got talent, too. I mean, everybody sleeps on us, and they put us as the underdog.","I'm not really into the whole lyrics thing; I just like to make music that people like to listen to.","I just consider myself an artist. I don't really rap. I don't really sing. I just do what I feel is good, and people like it.","I was always able to get money, but now it's a little bit more money, and I manage the same way. I just want to see my family do better.","If only the people around you know you're an artist, then you're doing something wrong.","I don't ever try to make a song better than my last song. I just try to make it different from my last one.","People don't really call me a rapper. They call me Mr. 'Trap Queen'. The 'Trap Queen' Guy.","You don't really gotta rap no more; you can just say the verse with a swag now.","Once I come up with the concept, the rest of the song just comes.","Oh man, I would definitely love to work with Kanye on something. But it really is all up to him, so whatever he wants to do, I'm with it.","I'm just really waiting for the music to get cooked the right way, and once it's cooked, I'm going to serve that meal that everybody's been waiting for.","The first song I did was over a Chief Keef beat - 'Understand Me.'

A better world is possible!","There is nothing that compares to the Holocaust.","The people respect and believe in men who fulfill their duty.","The Arab population of Palestine are victims of genocidal actions; their lands are confiscated or deprived of water supplies in the semi-desert areas, and their homes are destroyed with heavy wrecking equipment.","I became a Communist by studying capitalist political economy, and when I had some understanding of that problem, it actually seemed to me so absurd, so irrational, so inhuman, that I simply began to elaborate on my own formulas for production and distribution.","I am a Marxist Leninist and I will be one until the last day of my life.","We do not exploit our dolphins for profit.","I find capitalism repugnant. It is filthy, it is gross, it is alienating... because it causes war, hypocrisy and competition.","I began revolution with 82 men. If I had to do it again, I do it with 10 or 15 and absolute faith. It does not matter how small you are if you have faith and plan of action.","Someday, the capitalist system will disappear in the United States, because no social class system has been eternal. One day, class societies will disappear.","A revolution is not a bed of roses.","Homeland or death! Socialism or death! We shall overcome!","The fact is, when men carry the same ideals in their hearts, nothing can isolate them - neither prison walls nor the sod of cemeteries. For a single memory, a single spirit, a single idea, a single conscience, a single dignity will sustain them all.","I don't think anyone has been slandered more than the Jews.","Men do not shape destiny, Destiny produces the man for the hour.","Many things shall change in Cuba, but they shall change because of our efforts and despite the United States. Perhaps that empire shall crumble first.","Condemn me. It does not matter. History will absolve me.","I am Fidel Castro and we have come to liberate Cuba.","Following the missile crisis, detente started to gain ground between the United States and the Soviet Union, so the international political climate improved after that.","It is a fundamental principle of criminal law that an imputed offense must correspond exactly to the type of crime described by law. If no law applies exactly to the point in question, then there is no offense.","No political event can be judged outside of the era and the circumstances in which it took place.","Soon, I'll be like all the others. The time will come for all of us, but the ideas of the Cuban Communists will remain.","Our Revolution emerged where it was least expected by the empire, in a hemisphere where it was used to acting like an all-powerful master.","Chavez, who came out of the ranks of the Venezuelan Army, is methodical and tireless. I have observed him over the course of 17 years, since his first visit to Cuba. He is an extremely humanitarian and law-abiding person; he has never taken revenge on anybody.","At the age of 6, a teacher full of ambitions, who taught in the small public school of Biran, convinced my family that I should travel to Santiago de Cuba to accompany my older sister who would enter a highly prestigious convent school. Including me was a skill of that very teacher from the little school in Biran.","Religious faith, like political belief, should be based on reasoning, on the development of thought and feelings. The two things are inseparable.","It constitutes a superhuman effort to lead any people in times of crisis. Without them, the changes would be impossible.","The Cuban model doesn't even work for us anymore.","The revolution is a dictatorship of the exploited against the exploiters.","If you calculate 15 minutes a day to shave, that is 5,000 minutes a year spent shaving.","The kings of Spain brought us the conquistadores and masters, whose footprints remained in the circular land grants assigned to those searching for gold in the sands of rivers, an abusive and shameful form of exploitation, traces of which can be noted from the air in many places around the country.","The people of Egypt are an intelligent people with a glorious history who left their mark on civilization.","No thieves, no traitors, no interventionists! This time the revolution is for real!","Christ didn't choose the rich to preach the doctrine; he choose 12 poor ignorant workers - that is, he chose the proletariat of the times.","The United States tyrannizes and pillages the globalized world with its political, economic, technological, and military might.","Defending peace is the duty of all.","Nothing in the world is irreversible, not even capitalism.","NATO's brutal military alliance has become the most perfidious instrument of repression known in the history of humankind.","I would not vote for the mayor. It's not just because he didn't invite me to dinner, but because on my way into town from the airport there were such enormous potholes.","Venezuela, given its extraordinary educational, cultural, and social developments, and its vast energy and natural resources, is called on to become a revolutionary model for the world.","The lies of the empire and the treason of the quislings shall be defeated.","I don't think it is so difficult to solve the problems between Cuba and the United States; it all depends on whether there is a dialogue, a discussion, or if the prejudices and hatred of people like the extremists and terrorists from the Cuban community, who try to impose their policies, prevail.","Senator McCain is Israel's most unconditional ally in Mossad's machinations, something that even his worst adversaries would have been able to imagine. McCain participated alongside this secret service in the creation of the Islamic State, which has appropriated a considerable part of Iraq as well as a third of Syria, according to its affirmations.","The universities are available only to those who share my revolutionary beliefs.","Nature teaches us that tens of billions of light years may have passed, and life in all of its expressions has always been subjected to an incredible combination of matter and radiation.","Our position is that we do not accept conditions of any kind which may affect the independence and sovereignty of our country just with the view to solve economic problems existing between the United States and Cuba.","General Giap was one of the most brilliant military strategists of our era, who in Dien Bien Phu was able to place missile launchers in remote, mountainous jungles, something the yankee and European military officers considered impossible.","None of us has any personal interest above the interests of the country. Our country is more important than our careers.","We are proud of the history of our country; we learned it in school and have grown up hearing of freedom, justice and human rights.","Social struggles have been taking place throughout millennia, since human beings, by resorting to wars, were able to take hold of a surplus production to satisfy the essential needs of life.","I am not a communist and neither is the revolutionary movement.","There is plenty of building material and more than enough manpower to make a decent home for every Cuban. But if we continue to wait for the golden calf, a thousand years will have gone by, and the problem will remain the same.","The human being is a strange mixture of blind instinct, on one hand, and conscience, on the other.","Cuba came to be the last country to get rid of Spanish colonialism and the first to shake off the heinous imperialist tutelage.","The Revolution did not assume a socialist nature because of support from the U.S.S.R.; it was the other way around: support from the U.S.S.R. was produced by the socialist nature of the Cuban Revolution. To such a degree, that when the U.S.S.R. disappears, Cuba keeps on being socialist.","I think that a man should not live beyond the age when he begins to deteriorate, when the flame that lighted the brightest moment of his life has weakened.","Mubarak was oppressing and pillaging his own people. He was an enemy to the Palestinians and an accomplice of Israel, the sixth nuclear power on the planet, associated with the war-mongering NATO group.","North Americans don't understand... that our country is not just Cuba; our country is also humanity.","I will never retire from politics, the revolution, or the ideas I have.","Even in the United States, the enslavement of African descendants continued until the presidency of Abraham Lincoln. That brutal form of slavery was abolished there hardly thirty years before it was abolished in Cuba.","We do not need the empire to give us anything.","It doesn't sound too good to say I am the son of a landowner, so let us rather say I am the grandson of exploited Galician peasants.","In my next incarnation, I want to be a writer.","More than 820 million people in the world suffer from hunger; and 790 million of them live in the Third World.","At times, I've referred to Christ's miracles, and have said, 'Well, Christ multiplied the fish and the loaves to feed the people. That is precisely what we want to do with the Revolution and socialism.'","Sorry, I'm still a dialectical materialist.","What prevails in every corner of this globalized world is the real struggle of our species for its own survival.","When the Revolution triumphed in 1959, our island was a true Yankee colony. The United States had duped and disarmed our Liberation Army. One couldn't speak of developed agriculture, but of immense plantations exploited on the base of manual and animal labour that in general used neither fertilizers nor machinery.","We are political animals, as, not without reason, affirmed Aristotle, who perhaps influenced humanity's thinking more than any other ancient philosopher through his almost 200 treatises, according to reports, of which only 31 have been preserved.","My idea, as the whole world knows, is that the capitalist system now doesn't work either for the United States or the world, driving it from crisis to crisis, which are each time more serious.","Reactionaries often describe both Marx and Lenin as theorists, without taking into consideration that their utopias inspired Russia and China - the two countries called upon to lead a new world which will allow for human survival if imperialism does not first unleash a criminal, exterminating war.","I never saw a contradiction between the ideas that sustain me and the ideas of that symbol, of that extraordinary figure, Jesus Christ.","How can we help President Obama?","I have always fought for concrete facts, for justice.","I believe Karl Marx could have subscribed to the Sermon on the Mount.","We have always been prepared to negotiate with the U.S. government everything that has to do with bilateral relations, on a basis of the strictest mutual respect for the sovereign rights of each country. We will never try to ask the government of the United States to change its economic and political system.","Cuba never had advisors in Vietnam. The military there knew very well how to conduct their war.","England was the first true colonial power to use its dominion over a large part of Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Australia, North America, and many Caribbean islands, in the first half of the 20th century.","During the second half of the twentieth century, I had the privilege of living through years of intensive erudition, and I realized that Canadians, located in the northernmost region of this hemisphere, were always respectful towards our country.","Never have we stolen the intelligences of other peoples. On the contrary, in Cuba we have trained tens of thousands of doctors and other top-level professionals, for free, in order to send them back to their own countries.","The United States is supplying the most modern and sophisticated weaponry to Israel to the tune of billions of dollars every year.","Oil has become the principal wealth in the hands of the great Yankee transnationals; through this energy source, they had an instrument that considerably expanded their political power in the world.","Born to a tribal Bedouin family of nomadic desert shepherds in the region of Tripoli, Gaddafi was profoundly anti-colonialist. It is affirmed that his paternal grandfather died fighting against the Italian invaders when Libya was invaded by them in 1911.","I am a just man.","Peoples do not defy repression and death, nor do they remain for nights on end protesting energetically, just because of merely formal matters.","Although we resolutely supported the armed struggle against Batista's tyranny, we were, on principle, opposed to any terrorist action that could cause the death of innocent people.","You may agree or not with Gaddafi's political ideas, but no one has the right to question the existence of Libya as an independent state and member of the United Nations.","The revenues of Cuban state-run companies are used exclusively for the benefit of the people, to whom they belong.","Capitalism is using its money; we socialists throw it away.","I neither will aspire to nor will I accept, the position of president of the council of state and commander in chief.","Some time ago, the United States was an English colony. If an Englishman were asked if the United States would be independent, he would have said no, that it would always be an English colony.","I can assure you that my first and foremost interest is my country.","Every country must be absolutely free to adopt the type of economic, political and social system that it considers convenient.","I was not the son of a worker or lacking in material or social resources for a relatively comfortable existence; I could say I miraculously escaped wealth.","The existing world economic order constitutes a system of plundering and exploitation like no other in history. Thus, the peoples believe less and less in statements and promises.","The prestige of the international financial institutions rates less than zero.","I was born in a territory called Biran, in the eastern region of Cuba. It's known by that name, although it has never appeared on a map.","On one occasion, I accompanied my father to Pinares de Mayari. I was eight or nine years old. How he enjoyed talking when he left the house in Biran! There he was the proprietor of the land where sugar cane, pasture, and other agricultural crops were planted.","I almost laughed about the Machiavellian plans of the presidents of the United States.","Without a tutor to help me in the study of Marxism-Leninism, I was no more than a theorist and, of course, had total confidence in the Soviet Union.","To our brothers in Latin America and the world, we must convey that the Cuban people will overcome.","None of us is designed for the role we must assume in a revolutionary society, although Cubans had the privilege of Jose Marti's example.","Any negotiated, peaceful solution to the problems between the United States and peoples, or any people of Latin America, which does not imply force or the use of force, must be addressed in accordance with international principles and norms.","Cynicism is something which has become symbolic of imperial policy.","Twenty-six million Russians died in the defense of their homeland against the Nazis.","Chinese combatants, men and women, inheritors of a millennial culture, are people of uncommon intelligence and an invincible spirit of struggle.","Xi Jinping is one of the strongest and most capable revolutionary leaders I have met in my life.","The Soviet Union, the socialist camp, the People's Republic of China, and North Korea helped us resist, with essential supplies and weapons, the implacable blockade of the United States, the most powerful empire ever to exist.","No one even knows one percent of the fabulous history of Man; but thanks to history, we know about occurrences that go beyond the limits of the imaginable.","For revolutionary Cubans, to cooperate with other poor and exploited peoples has always been a political principle and a duty towards humanity.","Marx and Engels never talked about murdering the bourgeois. According to the old bourgeois concept, the judges were the ones who judged, and the executioners were the ones who executed.","I barely need to reiterate what you already know: the close links that exist between our people and the people of Venezuela and Hugo Chavez, the promoter of the Bolivarian Revolution and the United Socialist Party he founded.","The unyielding resistance of the Cuban patriots is symbolized by our 5 Heroes. They shall never back down! They shall never surrender!","Every citizen has the real right to receive general education and professional training at no cost, something that the United States has not been able to ensure for all its inhabitants.","As we know, while our species remains alive, everybody has the sacred duty to be optimistic. Ethically, any other behaviour wouldn't be admissible.","The death of Abdel Nasser on September 28, 1970, was an irreversible setback for Egypt.","The United States never stopped conspiring against the Arab world, which holds the largest oil reserves on the planet.","The squandering of oil and gas is associated with one of the greatest tragedies, not in the least resolved, which is suffered by humankind: climate change.","When at just 27 years old, Qaddafi, colonel in the Libyan army, inspired by his Egyptian colleague Abdel Nasser, overthrew King Idris I in 1969, he applied important revolutionary measures such as agrarian reform and the nationalization of oil.","The last time I visited Qaddafi was in May of 2001, 15 years after Reagan attacked his rather modest residence where he took me to show me how it had been left.","The traditional stand adopted by the Cuban Revolution, which was always opposed to any action that could jeopardize the life of civilians, is well known.","Obama has no way to conceal that Osama was executed in front of his children and wives, who are now under the custody of the authorities of Pakistan, a Muslim country of almost 200 million inhabitants, whose laws have been violated, its national dignity offended, and its religious traditions desecrated.","The world has not yet reached the point which, in my view, is an essential condition for the survival of our human species: access by all the peoples to the material resources of this planet.","I see Libya as a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and a sovereign State of the nearly 200 members of the United Nations.","Even Gaddafi's adversaries assure us that he stood out for his intelligence as a student; he was expelled from high-school for his anti-monarchic activities. He managed to enroll in another high-school and later graduated in law at the University of Benghazi at the age of 21.","Experience acquired in the heroic battle against Batista's tyranny showed that the enemy, no matter what his strength, could not defeat the Cuban people.","The U.S.S.R. had absolutely nothing to do with the triumph of the Cuban Revolution."],"Filipe Luis":["Epic things happen in soccer.","In Spain you fight, of course, against Real Madrid and Barcelona, and they almost never lose because they have the biggest squads, and they are two of the biggest clubs in the world. So it's really difficult.","A footballer's career is very short, and I want to finish it in a strong and spectacular way.","You know 'The Shawshank Redemption?' I've seen that movie, like, 30 times or something. 'Dirty Harry,' too - I love that movie.","I watch a lot of movies, and sometimes I watch the same ones a lot of times, so you get to learn a lot of words that way.","I lived in Holland for one year when I was younger and, although they speak Dutch there, I learned a little bit of English while I was there, but really I learned from movies and TV series like '24' and 'Prison Break.'","Some players benefit from criticism, but for others, they don't.","In one year I won two titles - one being the Premier League. I have a trophy at home that not many people have and in possibly the most competitive league in the world.","I consider my time with Chelsea a personal triumph.","Often, players talk when they feel they are not being valued as they deserve. Then they get more attention.","Messi is so good that he can win La Liga even with a mediocre team, which is not the case. Barca remain up top every year because of him.","I'm always in the 'butcher' role. But the only way to stop Messi one-on-one is to foul him. Otherwise, if I'm alone, I'll only get the ball one in 20 times. I have to use other weapons, I know the best way to stop him. I know he does not like playing with his back to goal, you must be right on top of him when he gets the ball.","At the level Neymar moves at, you do not change teams for money.","Paulinho will surprise many people. If he does not fit at Barca, he would at Atletico.","I've had some of the best years of my career at Atletico and remember the supporters, my teammates, and the coaching staff fondly.","Everything can happen in football.","Speaking about Mourinho is always controversial, and there's always some intrigue surrounding him. But he is an awesome coach who tries to take the maximum from each and every one of his players.","I feel at home in Madrid. I have always felt important, wanted, and trusted by everyone here.","When I left for Chelsea, I wanted to prove that I could play in the Premier League, but it didn't happen the way I dreamed.","When Atletico tried to buy me back, I did everything I could to make it possible. I had offers from clubs in France and Italy, but I would not have left Chelsea for any other side - only for Atletico Madrid.","Everyone wants to play. If you don't, normally you're not happy.","When you work with Mourinho, you have to know that the group, the collective is above the individual.","Neymar and Hazard are amazing talents, but the player who gave me most trophies was Diego Costa.","He always scores the opening goal. Because it is one thing to score 30 goals with hat-tricks in easy wins, and another that 20 of those 30 goals are enough to win 1-0. Nobody does that as well as Diego Costa.","It's true I wasn't as important at Chelsea. I never demanded that. What I wanted was to be a champion, because few people get that. I succeeded. But the happiness wasn't there.","If you give Messi a metre, he'll snatch the ball and leave you behind.","Many players enter the pitch just to change shirts, but I don't.","I hope I can retire at Atletico Madrid.","At Atleti, you get to be at a club which is growing all the time. I don't believe there is any better club.","Wherever Mourinho goes, he is a champion.","Playing with Coutinho is easy. He's a very quick player who dribbles well. He knows how to play out wide, and my job is not just to go past and help him: it's also to give the greatest number of passes to him in space around the opposition right-back.","In the Premier League the big clubs can lose and drop points. Games that are supposed to be easy are never easy.","I was delighted when I found out that Atletico wanted to take me back. It's the best thing that could have happened to me.","When I arrived at Chelsea, I had got used to playing 50 games, and suddenly, I was sharing my position with another player.","When you're not playing, sometimes you're not full of confidence.","It's not easy playing against Barcelona in the Champions League. They are a club with a lot of history.","With regards to the fans, whenever I've played in the Atletico shirt, I have given all that I can. I think I will win the fans back on the field and not with words.","The Ballon d'Or is a subjective matter.","I admire Messi: he's never complained to me in any game we played, but I've also never asked him for his jersey and never would. I came to win, not to say I played against Messi.","I have always liked Chelsea a lot. I watch a lot of the Premier League, and it is a club where you can feel the warmth of the fans."],"Filippo Brunelleschi":["Do not share your inventions with many; share them only with the few who understand and love the sciences.","To disclose too much of one's inventions and achievements is one and the same thing as to give up the fruit of one's ingenuity.","Many are ready, when listening to the inventor, to belittle and deny his achievements so that he will no longer be heard in honourable places, but after some months or a year, they use the inventor's words in speech or writing or design.","The gifts given to us by God must not be relinquished to those who speak ill of them and who are moved by envy or ignorance.","We must not show to all and sundry the secrets of the waters flowing in ocean and river, or the devices that work on these waters.

I see the role I get given on the page. I try to bring it to life as best as I can.","I'm a huge advocate for human rights and cultural rights. I stand up for minorities and will always continue to do so.","I was never a troublemaker, but I also was never a nerdy kid. I was never a cool kid or a sports kid. At lunchtimes, I never fit in with any cliques, so I'd end up just walking around the school by myself, listening to music.","I will say that Marvel is 100 times more secretive than 'Game of Thrones.' Like, they're not even on the same playing field.","I find the comic book audience a lot more intense than the fantasy one, definitely.","I know feeling pressure gets you nowhere creatively. You've just got to understand the character, understand the story, and just play it to the fullest extent.","My mum was a child minder, but now she fosters. My dad was in the police force, and now he's a private detective.","At first, I didn't know what an actor was. I thought it was an acrobat. I saw acrobats at the circus, and I thought that was interesting. In my head, that was what I imagined I wanted to be when I grew up. Then I realized what an actor was, and I've gravitated to it ever since.","For me as an actor, I find it's most creative when I'm bringing myself into the role rather than putting the role on. I feel like it's more of a cathartic experience.","About a year after leaving drama school or a year and a half - and I was working solidly ever since leaving drama school - I picked up 'Game of Thrones.'","I respect Marvel as a company, and I think they're great, but never in my life have I looked up to being a superhero.","I worked on 'Game Of Thrones' for six years, so I'm very well equipped to handle hype surrounding television shows.","I've always been interested in mindfulness and alternative ways of seeing the world.","I get that people want more diversity in TV and film, and I stand by that. I stand in solidarity with better diversity in TV shows, especially for Asian actors. I agree with that 100 per cent.","Women are the strong people in this world, not men. I think TV is finally catching up with that reality, and thank God.","There's nothing interesting about seeing our characters for an hour and a half do some flashy flying in the sky and beating up on some buildings. It's boring, and people don't want that anymore. They want character, and they want story.","I'm a big fan of 'Akira,' and I think comics are a great place to tell intelligent, fantastical stories. You can say stuff that you wouldn't be able to in other mediums.","A lot of the vibe in London is being sucked dry because of the economic situation. It's very expensive, and it gives you nothing back. New York still feels like there's stuff going on. People are struggling to create art. There's still a vibe.","New York has a deep culture of house and dance music, and to be able to tap into that is my way of shutting off. I go to friends' parties and local spots around the area: places I can go to, have a dance, and forget about being an actor and the attention.","When I was in drama school, I really got into a dark place. I went to a therapist - it was really helpful to have that dialogue with someone. So I understand anxiety.","I've had this theory for a while, but I think there needs to be a message with the end of 'Game of Thrones.' You know? I think what needs to happen is ice and fire are going to go to war, a huge war between those two factions, and I think, in that war, they will destroy themselves. There will be complete chaos, complete destruction.","The power should be in individual democracies in individual communities. It shouldn't be an oligarchy or some small group of elite. Power should be with the people and not with some politician or some heir to the throne or some madman.","'Thrones' would be the perfect platform to send a progressive message because right now, our politicians aren't telling us any truths. It's hard to find a good, meaningful message, so I think it's up to storytellers, television shows, and films to have an impact on the world conversation. Is that not what film and television is for?","I do feel like the media is one of the biggest problems. If you look at all these rolling news channels, they sensationalize the story, they focus on gossip, and they don't actually tell the full story.","Pretty much everyone on my iPod, I'd like to be friends with. But I'd say that the main two that I'd love to get into a conversation with are Werner Herzog and Graham Hancock."],"Finn Wittrock":["I want to keep pushing my boundaries. One of the biggest things I learned from 'Unbroken' is that you can go a lot further than you think you can. We often underestimate our actual capabilities.","Film and television are so piecemeal. You do one scene, and then you put it to bed, and then you do a scene that comes before. In a play, you have to go from beginning to end every night, and that's harder, but also more fulfilling in a way.","A lot of the stuff that's happening now, I can trace back to 'Death of a Salesman.' Francine Maisler, the casting director, saw 'Death of a Salesman' and called me in for 'Unbroken.' The casting director of 'Normal Heart' had seen 'Salesman' too. I look back on it now, and it's like one thing led to another; it was a chain reaction.","I have been thinking a lot about what we see in villains, how we relate to villains, and what it is about certain villains that we actually empathize with. Like Macbeth. We're not supposed to like a guy who kills the king and takes over, but there's something about him we're really fascinated by.","So many actors started on soap operas. So yeah, I'd graduated Julliard and done some theater. I've done a few guest spots on TV but nothing that long-term. I did a little 'E.R.' back when it was on, and a pilot for 'Cold Case.'","Soap operas are like boot camps for film actors, so I really learned a lot. It was a masterclass in working for camera. I made myself watch myself every day. I would sort of try and be objective about it and critique myself a little. There's a lot more skill set than people realize in soap operas. They shoot, like, 35 scenes a day.","There's monsters in all of us, but there's also vulnerability.","Ryan Murphy, he basically tries to find something that's a pulse, a pressure point in our culture, and he grabs it, and he squeezes it. I think 'Freak Show' has a lot to do with the entertainment industry and the way we entertain ourselves: the objectification of people and the lengths we'll go for our own amusement.","I caught the acting bug from my dad.","I found L.A. much less responsive to the name Juilliard than New York was. In New York, that name actually means something. People will look up from their desks when you walk in. In L.A. it's, 'Oh yeah, that's a music school. What do you play?'","Sometimes you're watching a great film actor, and if you stand 10 feet away from them, you're like, 'God, they're terrible. They're not doing anything.' And then you see the close-up, and it's so nuanced, and so much expression is happening. They were acting for that camera and for no one else.","In film, you're so much in the hands and at the mercy of the editor, so sometimes it's good to watch it just to see how it turns out - it can be so different than how you imagined it. But sometimes it's better to just let it go for your own sense of self worth.","That's one of my real goals is to keep theater in my life.","At first, before you meet her, you're like, 'I'm gonna meet Angelina Jolie! I'm talking to Angelina Jolie!' And then, within a matter of five minutes, you're like, 'Oh, I'm just talking to my director,' and it's just back to work. She really is all about the work. She's so surprisingly down-to-earth.","Writing is something I've always done on the side. I thought that no one would be interested, so I kept it to myself.","I was playing a defensive guard in 'My All American' who is a really fast runner, so a lot of my training was running. I wasn't too worried about bulking up because he was supposed to be on the small side.","I played baseball growing up, second base, and then when I got to high school,it just didn't exist there.","I started writing when I started acting professionally because, with acting, there's so much time when you're not working, and there's so much rejection and so little you have control of. Writing is something that you can do, and no one can tell you not to.","I think in some ways, acting and writing are the same. You're getting inside the skin of someone else; you're creating their language and their actions. As a writer, you have to see the whole picture and the structure, and you have to understand every character.","I would love to do Shakespeare in New York.","I would love to play Henry IV, Henry V, and Hamlet.","I've learned 90 percent of what I know from watching and listening to actors. A good leading actor is the rock of the show. Their energy and their tone really sets the groundwork for how everything is going to work. I've been lucky to deal with stars who are very giving and generous.","Doing theater anywhere, especially in L.A., is a constant uphill battle, and there's also the unsexy parts of the business that you're faced with, like getting money. It's a really great thing to do. You feel like you're really an artist when you're doing that and you're in a company of artists.","I'm usually late to the game on shows and watch them after they've aired. But I love 'House of Cards,' 'The Killing,' 'Orange Is the New Black,' loved 'True Detective,' and 'Arrested Development' when it was on. Also 'The Wire,' though I was way late to the game on that.","I'm a klutz, through and through.","I went to an Arts High School, so everyone there was kind of anti-clique, though they still happened. I guess I was in the theatre-dork clique. Not to be confused with the musical-theatre-dork clique."],"Fiona Apple":["I used to get a shiver if I thought about holding balloons, because I was scared of floating away.","If you want to see me cry, just come to a photo shoot.","Life is all about the friendship and the love and the music. It sounds silly, but it is. I want to have that experience as much as I can as an adult, not as a kid doing something that people are telling her she has to do. If anyone gets in my way, I'm going to get them out of my way.","The way I feel about music is that there is no right and wrong. Only true and false.","I've gone through stages where I hate my body so much that I won't even wear shorts and a bra in my house because if I pass a mirror, that's the end of my day.","Five years from now I'm probably going to look back on the things I'm doing and cringe.","I would really like to go back to school. I would love it now.","I'm not the Queen. I'm not a huge superstar; I don't get paparazzi around me.","For me, the best times are always going to be the most intense, the ones with the highest highs and the lowest lows.","I wasn't very ambitious as a child. I'm still not.","Rape is the most humiliating thing that can be done to you; it's the most vulnerable that you can be. But once I realized that, I became a stronger person and faced all my fears.","I still don't know what Episcopalian means.","I dare anybody to look at me and say I'm anorexic. I'm so totally not.","I really don't think anything I do is a mistake. It could be if I didn't learn from it.","I'm not a control freak.","If I respect myself and believe in what I'm doing, no one can touch me.","Now I feel like whatever I do, no one can hurt me. I cannot be violated, I cannot be humiliated, I cannot be disregarded, I cannot be disrespected.","When you're surrounded by all these people, it can be even lonelier than when you're by yourself. You can be in a huge crowd, but if you don't feel like you can trust anybody or talk to anybody, you feel like you're really alone.","And if I'm being honest, I don't think I have an ex-boyfriend who would have something mean to say about me.","I can bake. I made myself some nice French fries once. But otherwise I just eat out. Lots of salad bars.","The only reason that it takes me seven years to do stuff is because I just don't really have a plan.","You think you're looking at things all the time, but you're not looking at things, you're looking at what your brain is interpreting through light and color. And who knows what everybody else sees?","If I have one success in my relationship history, it's with the people who listen to my music. I think that they'll be there with me forever, and I'll be there with them forever. And I'm totally satisfied with that.","I wrote 'Criminal' in 45 minutes when everyone else went to lunch because I had to have a hit. I can force myself to do the work, but only if someone is right up behind me.","I got into therapy in the fifth grade because I said in a sarcastic way that I was going to kill myself, and they didn't get it then. Nothing's changed.","Nothing that you do will ever feel good if you let people convince you that you have no choice.","How can you go wrong with two people in love? If a good boy loves a good girl, good. If a good boy loves another good boy, good. And if a good girl loves the goodness in good boys and good girls, then all you have is more goodness, and goodness has nothing to do with sexual orientation.","I was told so many times when I was a kid, 'I can't be friends with you, you're too intense, you're too sad all the time.' I really thought that when I made the first album that everyone would understand me, all the people who weren't my friends would become my friends.","Everybody sees me as this sullen and insecure little thing. Those are just the sides of me that I feel it's necessary to show because no one else seems to be showing them.","I caved in to what people wanted me to do. I thought that they weren't going to like me if I didn't.","I don't care what people do. I don't care how people remember my albums. I do them for my own reasons.","I don't have a big thing about leaving my mark or being historic.","I don't want to give any advice to a 19-year-old, because I want a 19-year-old to make mistakes and learn from them. Make mistakes, make mistakes, make mistakes. Just make sure they're your mistakes.","I got all my work done to graduate in two months and then they were like, I'm sorry, you have to take driver's ed. I just kind of went, Oh, forget it.","I got drunk when I was five. Everybody gets drunk before they're 21.","I have a very steadfast tendency to parent myself, to monitor my development into the person I want to be. I've tried to keep the corruption minimal.","I know what my job is: I write the songs, I sing them, I play them on the piano.","I never thought I'd be in a position where people would be talking about my sexuality and saying how good I look in underwear.","I never went to concerts when I was a kid, so I never knew if what I was doing onstage was right.","I read on the Internet that I was dead.","I resent limitations. I'm going to be this way for a while.","I want to be like the patron saint of reality.","I wanted to write a happy song. I didn't know how.","I was so self-critical. I still am, but it's not as bad anymore.","I'm here because of what I write. Obviously, I must know something.","I'm incredibly impressed by people who organize to achieve a goal, and believe that they can make a difference and then go ahead and do just that. I think it's incredible.","I'm not used to not having enough time to live with the songs. Usually, if I write something, I live with it for a little while.","I've never been to the websites. It's a lot healthier for me to keep out of the conversations about me.","My whole life, people have been saying, Why are you so angry?","Sometimes interviews are fun and good conversations, but stuff like photo shoots and appearances at places where you have to meet a lot of people - I was never really made for this kind of stuff.","The age thing really bugs me. Do people have more of a right to not like what I say because I'm 19?","There aren't many poster children for cool angst. Everybody thinks it's cool if you're the bad girl.","What's really good is African drum music.","I don't know if anybody wants to mix their politics with their entertainment.","The quick success was a bit strange to get used to.","Our ancestors always thought of the worst thing that could happen, and that's why we're alive.","You know, I've always thought that it would be really funny if somebody made a romantic comedy where absolutely everything went well from beginning to end.","I just tend to do things to myself that I don't realize I'm doing. Sometimes I bite my lip so that it splits and hurts, and yet I can't stop. And sometimes I'd play shows on the last run, I'd scratch my neck while I was singing, and I'd horrified to see these red streaks of blood after.","No, I've never wanted kids. But I do read about parenting a lot.","I can't remember writing any of the songs that I've written.","I feel like I'm 100 years old. I can't tell you what I did today. I can't tell you what I did for seven years. I can't tell you. It happens so seamlessly - I'm just floating along and seven years go by.","But I honestly don't read critics. My dad reads absolutely everything ever written about me. He calls me up to read ecstatic reviews, but I always insist that I can't hear them. If you give value to the good reviews, you have to give value to the criticism.","Hearing my songs in public freaks me out a bit. There was one restaurant I really liked in L.A., but I had to stop going there when they started playing my music. It felt kinda awkward.","I got a lot of problems, but I'm really good at intuiting what I need to do to be happy with whatever I create. I know when to stop myself, I know when to start, I know when to leave something alone. I guess I just kind of indulge that completely, and so I just take my time.","I also just accept that I might never want to write a song again.","You can live your whole life in your brain and not experience what's around you. You go crazy that way.","Men are my bread and butter. It's what I live for! I have no shame about that.","In a strange way, I'm way more comfortable onstage than anywhere else.","In a sense it's a lot crazier when you're on the road and it's a lot less stable, but it's actually really healthy for me because it keeps me from isolating, which I tend to do a lot.","I'm a really good parent to myself sometimes, and I do things that make me learn and grow.","Because for whatever reason, even though I want to stay home all the time and be left alone, I want to tell the world who I am now.","When I was a kid - 10, 11, 12, 13 - the thing I wanted most in the world was a best friend. I wanted to be important to people; to have people that understood me. I wanted to just be close to somebody.","I don't go on lunch dates with friends. I hear about people having dinner parties, but I never do that. I'm not really human.","I walk my dog at dawn because I don't like people to be around.","There were songs I would write about breaking up with somebody before I broke up with them, months and months before I broke up with them.","I don't think what I look like is relevant.","As a person who performs on stage, it's good to be emotionally open. If you mess with someone when they are in that state, it's like you're messing with an animal when it's eating.","I think I'm better at live shows than I used to be because I'm way more comfortable with the uncomfortable pauses between songs. Now, rather than trying to talk or do a costume change, I'll use those moments for myself. I listen to what other people are playing, or just rest, or dance, even though I don't know how to.","The worst pain in the world is shame. I spend a lot of time trying to not do anything bad to anyone, but you can't live your life and not hurt people.","I was never somebody who grew up going, 'I really want to be a singer in a band,' and I never had any ambition toward anything, really.","I had really bad obsessive-compulsive disorder. At its worst, I was compelled to leave my house at three o'clock in the morning and go out in the alley because I just knew that the paper-towel roll I threw in the recycling bin was uncomfortable, like it was lying the wrong way, and I would be down in the garbage."],"Fiona Barton":["The unsaid is a powerful tool. It invites the reader into the narrative, filling in gaps, interpreting silences and half-finished sentences, and seeing the hidden fear in someone's eye.","The success of 'The Widow' meant there were expectations for the second book from the first word, and it has created a completely different writing experience. Not to say I haven't enjoyed writing 'The Child,' but I confess there were times when I felt as if I was wrenching it out of my body with bloodied fingernails!","As a reporter, I spent a great deal of time in court. During brief breaks in testimony, I would often look at the spouse, usually the wife, of the accused. I began to wonder how listening to the details of a crime purportedly committed by your spouse would affect that person's view of her husband.","I know I love a novel with an unreliable narrator, and I think many readers do as well.","When you think about it, psychological thrillers often involve extraordinary events happening to ordinary people.","It's a wonderful experience to be reading a story and think you've got things all figured out, and then suddenly, it all goes upside-down on you.","I can't think whether I've actually interviewed the widow of a crime suspect. Obviously, I've interviewed members of the families of people who've been accused of things.","Since reading 'Sophie's Choice,' I have been haunted by the agonizing idea of choosing between two children.","When you are a journalist, you are always looking for the next story. It might come from a phone call from a contact or an unanswered question you spot in someone else's article.","The emotions, responsibilities - and the pain - of motherhood are unique to each of us with children. Ask any woman, and she will have her own story to tell.","I chose to write from different perspectives despite its complexity because it is what I have always done as a journalist.","Once you write a book, you hand it over to the readers, and it's their book then. They're so involved. They ask questions about details that I haven't even thought about.","It's amazing to me that journalists are held in such low esteem.","When you start writing fiction, you have to learn to invent, and it's very hard at the beginning to stop relying on facts and what you've heard.","Mental health is something that I'm very interested in.","The imagination is such as powerful tool: suggestion is all you need. People fill in gaps.","When I first became a journalist, people said, 'Oh, that must be interesting.' They saw it as slightly glamorous, slightly edgy. They wanted to know more.","A lot of people think journalists are criminals, and there are some who haven't helped us. But the media is essential for democratic society.","As a journalist, your words are regularly read by lots of people, but they're not your words: they're someone else's. You're quoting people.","Writing is not just about putting words on a page. Ideas have to cook first.","Garrison Keillor's 'Lake Wobegon' books create a world I can immerse myself in over and over. I love the deadpan humour, the warmth, and the wonderful characters in The Sidetrack Tap. I discovered them when I was about 30, starting with 'Leaving Home' and 'We Are Still Married,' and fell in love with the place and those flat Midwestern vowels.","I like my villains clever, deep, and driven by pure evil.","For me, there has always been the irresistible lure of a secret.","It was this fascination with hidden lives, I suspect, that led me to journalism; seeking to uncover the truth about people became a job.","We may like to pretend otherwise, but we all have thoughts we don't want anyone else to know, things we've done that would change the way people feel about us, or parts of our lives that we would rather forget.","For most of us, our protective lies or omissions are so insignificant that being found out would be only mildly embarrassing. But for some of us, our secret may threaten to destroy everything. And that is food and drink to a novelist.","The righting of historic wrongs has chimed with something fundamental in me since I was a young reader. I love the forensic skills, the psychological insights, and the sheer bloody-mindedness of various detectives - professional or accidental - inching toward the truth of a long-buried secret.","The secrets of small towns have fascinated writers and readers since the first psychological thriller was penned.","Donna Tartt is a genius.","As a journalist, I've been a professional watcher, picking up the body language and verbal tics that make us individuals and interesting to others.","Over the years, I've interviewed the victims, the guilty, the famous, the important, and the ordinary people affected by tragedy or good fortune. But strangely, it is not always the people in the spotlight that have stayed with me. It is often those on the periphery, the bit players in the drama, that continue to haunt.","It is a sad truth that apprenticeships fell out of favour in Britain in the Seventies and Eighties, when the manufacturing industries shed jobs and the construction industry went into decline.","Barbecue is to North Carolina as the hot dog is to New York.","Yes, there are bad apples, but I do feel journalists do a good job, often in very difficult circumstances."],"Fiona Dourif":["I feel like, sometimes, when things are just handed to people, in a way, right away, you don't get a sense of what the rejection and the struggle is like that comes along with life.","I have a different relationship with Chucky because he's been on top of my bookshelf in the corner of my living room for my entire life. He was a great tool for scaring friends, and when I see him in different theme parks I've been to, or in commercials, my heart swells a little bit, and I'm like, 'Aww! It's my Chucky!'","Chucky is absolutely still a puppet. He will remain to be.","I did an improv that was one of the most exhilarating ten minutes of my entire life. I mean, when you're doing it, you forget yourself.","I feel like acting is a ton of fun. It's the freest and most alive you can be.","I stopped watching horror movies after I watched 'Candyman' when I was - I don't know, fifteen or something. I remember my sister rented it, 'Candyman,' and it really, really scared me. And so it was only after I found myself in a horror film that I really went back and kind of rediscovered the genre.","I think if a horror movie is really scary, you'll think about it for weeks, and there's something kind of fun about that - about our art, really.","I actually think that's true, that we kind of create our own hell."],"Fiona Gubelmann":["I actually got started in acting when I was in pre-school. I was really into dance and performing, so my mom had me in dance classes, and then I got involved in a local theater company.","I went to UCLA as pre-med. When I was there my freshman year, I auditioned for a play and got it, and I was so passionate. I just loved acting so much that I decided to switch majors and pursue acting.","I definitely prefer working in comedy over drama, but at the same time, when it comes to comedy, I tend to prefer comedies that have a great sense of truth to them and that come from an honest place.","One of my favorite comedies is 'Groundhog Day' and 'Scrooged.' I love Bill Murray, and I think he's a great example of an actor who is funny.","I have a lot of anxiety about the red carpet. As a woman, it's uncomfortable to be in a position in which people are judging you, looking at what you're wearing, and criticizing you - not necessarily in a negative way.","I have an hourglass shape, and I think it's important to understand your body type and your personality type. Then make whatever is on trend and in fashion work for you."],"Fiona McIntosh":["When I first decided I was going to have a go at writing a book - and really, it was a mid-life crisis - I was 39. I was in business with my husband; we had a very busy lifestyle and quite a hectic schedule running this flourishing business in travel, and I found myself waking up and realising that I didn't want to do this anymore.","I don't see myself as an artist, as a writer. The sort of writing that I do, which is popular fiction, it's work. I have contracts to fulfil, and I have deadlines to meet.","Fantasy was something I'd read as a child. And, in fact, my teachers despaired a little bit because I refused to give up Enid Blyton. Then I walked through the wardrobe with C. S. Lewis, and I don't think I actually have returned fully from the wardrobe. So, fantasy was something that was in my life from quite young.","For me, a great fantasy is real people, a world I recognise, human struggle and magic. You've got to have magic to make a fantasy work. But I like my magic to be subtle. I don't want magic coming out of the hands of wizards. I want it to be pervading, sinister somehow.","Readers want to have the confidence that you understand the era in which the book is set, so for 'The Perfumer's Secret,' I needed to know everything about the First World War from a French perspective. I had to understand those people and that town in 1914.","We travel a lot from Australia and deliberately route ourselves through the U.A.E. because my whole family loves the place.","What I find is that it's the middle-aged authors who have lived a life who have the most important, interesting voices. They just need someone to give them the key to unlock the door."],"Fiona Shaw":["I once saw my mother playing Mary Magdalene in a parish event. But she had to put the role aside in order to go and front the choir who were singing at the same occasion. She left the stage halfway through the Crucifixion.","I certainly had no intention of playing a man.","So I just play the character, I play the lines.","Once you've done one style, you leave it for a while.","Theater dates very quickly.","I would say the next imminent hot writers are often the writers from the decade before you were born.","Every generation is obsessed with the decade before they were born.","Also, an area that interests me - and it will probably take years to state what I mean - is the period of the rise of democracy, with Tom Paine, which is around the turn of the 18th century into the 19th.","The word democracy has no meaning. Duty has gone. Only rights remain.","This whole tribal loyalty seems to have gone.","There was no professional theater in Cork, but still I did a lot of performing.","A lot of Irish people perform. They perform in drawing rooms. They sing songs and they play piano.","The energy released by it is enormous and it becomes quite addictive, the power between the audience and the actor.","People who are good at film have a relationship with the camera.","Theater is dangerously open to repetition. It's exciting when you hit on a new way.","I take the theater seriously in that I loathe it, I'm bored by it.","I find it incredibly tedious, hate that it murders itself with its own conservative pomposity.","Acting doesn't have to be threadbare misery all the time.","I can hardly decide what plays I should be in.","There is a great relief in experiencing the worst vicariously.","I think America becomes more disgruntled by going to the movies and having an endlessly good time at them.","I just think that things should be allowed to run their course, and not turned into a Disney ride.","I had a ball doing Harry Potter.","One moment cannot be the most important.","My mother taught me to read.","Irish people are educated not only about artistry but local history.","There's something about the Irish that is remarkable.","To be honest I live among the English and have always found them to be very honest in their business dealings. They are noble, hard-working and anxious to do the right thing. But joy eludes them, they lack the joy that the Irish have.","There once was a demographic survey done to determine if money was connected to happiness and Ireland was the only place where this did not turn out to be true.","Even when they have nothing, the Irish emit a kind of happiness, a joy.","The Americans are very clear, and obsessed with nouns.","I would love to write the story of my upbringing in Ireland.","I enjoy making films, but my heart is in the stage. Every night you have to be on. There's no second take.","My mother adores singing and plays piano. My uncle was a phenomenal pianist. My brother John is a double bassist. I used to play the piano, badly, and cello. My brother Peter played violin.","Like a lot of Irish households we read a lot of Irish history. It was almost Soviet, raising the next generation with a mythic view of their history.","Honestly, I get more recognized for 'Three Men and a Little Lady' than 'Harry Potter'.","A relationship is sent by God and accident.","I'm not on the run from anything and I'm not at all clear about what I'm running towards. But as some great writer put it, I want to be certain that when I arrive at death, I'm totally exhausted.","I'm not afraid of chaos and I'm happy talking to strangers. I really love not knowing where I'm going.","And by endlessly sanitizing our feelings, we actually feed a disgruntled nation.","I loathe bad theater and most theatre is very bad because it's repetitious, unexciting and, dangerously, it is sometimes praised for those things."],"Fionn Whitehead":["I knew it was called 'Dunkirk,' Christopher Nolan was directing it, and it was a war film. That was all anyone knew.","There's a restaurant I go to whenever I can called The Richmond Cafe. It's a little Thai restaurant owned by a group of Thai women - I think they're all a family, and they're just really, really nice, and they make amazing massaman curry.","My 'Dunkirk' co-star Harry Styles deals with some crazy fan stuff, but he's a very down-to-earth, lovely, funny guy.","I think you can overthink dealing with fame. To an extent, you've got to put yourself out there, but I feel like your work should really speak for itself, and I don't feel the need to go and make everyone like me because, to be honest, I'm not looking to be friends with the world. I'd much rather people watch the things that I'm in.","I don't really think much about how I would have fared in the Second World War. It's a topic that has to be treated with respect and subtlety, and you can't just go in all guns blazing and make an epic action film.","'HIM' is much more of a British, coming-of-age series, while 'Stranger Things' is very obviously a sci-fi drama.","I like to think I'm fairly grounded, and I have friends who will very happily tell me if I'm ever being big-headed. I know things will change. But I'm hoping it's nothing too drastic.","I'm not really a green juice kind of guy. I like feeling downtrodden and worthless when I walk around London and have someone click their tongue at me and tell me to speed up.","You make yourself do the physical aspects for a Christopher Nolan film!","The spirit of Dunkirk is something everyone grew up learning about. After Dunkirk, everyone came together and it set the tone in the U.K."],"Fionnula Flanagan":["When I first came to Hollywood, I could not break into movies.","The image of Ireland is projected as a male image in the acting world, similar to the way that the word of Ireland is male dominated.","I'm Irish and always will be, but America has taught me so much. Maybe it's here in the U.S. that we find a healing, for in the broader melting pot we get to look at some of these self-destructive attributes that we bring to bear upon our own quarrels and begin to solve them in ways other than just splitting apart.","I think Irish women are strong as horses, incredibly loyal and for the most part, funny, witty, bright and optimistic in the face of devastating reality.","People think we are such great talkers, but there is so much silence in Ireland about certain issues."],"Fiorello LaGuardia":["There is no Democratic or Republican way of cleaning the streets.","It makes no difference if I burn my bridges behind me - I never retreat."],"Fisher Ames":["A democracy is a volcano which conceals the fiery materials of its own destruction. These will produce an eruption and carry desolation in their way.","No one ever became, or can become truly eloquent without being a reader of the Bible, and an admirer of the purity and sublimity of its language.","The gentleman puts me in mind of an old hen which persists in setting after her eggs are taken away.","The known propensity of a democracy is to licentiousness which the ambitious call, and the ignorant believe to be liberty."],"Fisher Stevens":["I have a bit of a traveling addiction, and, ah, yeah. I went to, ah, Bali this summer.","But I used to have a bit of a gambling problem. And that would have been the answer to my prayers. It got worse when I started playing this character, too.","You know, it's a very sexist society, Indonesia.","I'm really obsessed with the past.","But did I think it would last more than 13 episodes at the time? No, I didn't think that. I never know.","It got a little boring I guess, playing the same note over and over.","Well, I just wanted to be a person. I just wanted them to keep writing me as humanistic as possible.","But I like being nasty. I like being cranky. Especially if it's a cold day in Chicago, it's nice to just take it out on Kyle, because he's so easy to scream at, you know?","But I'm trying to play into this role as much as possible and be a nicer person in real life.","I use that as my responsibility on the show, to be the pragmatist.","But basically what I like are the possibilities, and the fantasy element of the show. Not science fantasy so much, but fantasy, the humanistic elements and how people relate when they're in a dire situation or comedic situation.","Unfortunately, the public might not know that we get a script usually two days before shooting. So sometimes I'm shooting an episode and don't even know how it's going to end because I haven't read that yet.","I wanted to do an episode about Chuck having a gambling problem. I wanted to portray my addiction on the show. But I think it's a little edgy for Saturday night.","No, but I'm really lucky, because I'm not the superhero.","I really wanted to be born a woman. It all started there. A South American woman. And I'm upset that I was born a white Jewish male. I've been angry since.","I like people and get along, and I'm afraid to express my anger and my rage.","And TV is not the easiest place to be dangerous or on the edge. Especially on a Saturday night.","I used to be more of a wild kid. But I've slowed down.","The reason I took Early Edition - besides the fact that I liked it - was that it enabled me to start a production company in New York City. It's a low-budget film company to produce and direct movies."],"Flann O'Brien":["The majority of the members of the Irish parliament are professional politicians, in the sense that otherwise they would not be given jobs minding mice at crossroads.","A woman doesn't care if she hasn't a stomach, provided she looks as if she hasn't.","It is clear enough that you are making some distinction in what you said, that there is some nicety of terminology in your words. I can't quite follow you."],"Flannery O'Connor":["To expect too much is to have a sentimental view of life and this is a softness that ends in bitterness.","The truth does not change according to our ability to stomach it.","All my stories are about the action of grace on a character who is not very willing to support it, but most people think of these stories as hard, hopeless and brutal.","There's many a bestseller that could have been prevented by a good teacher.","I preach there are all kinds of truth, your truth and somebody else's. But behind all of them there is only one truth and that is that there's no truth.","Faith is what someone knows to be true, whether they believe it or not.","Conviction without experience makes for harshness.","I do not know You, God, because I am in the way. Please help me to push myself aside.","The writer operates at a peculiar crossroads where time and place and eternity somehow meet. His problem is to find that location.","It seems that the fiction writer has a revolting attachment to the poor, for even when he writes about the rich, he is more concerned with what they lack than with what they have.","The basis of art is truth, both in matter and in mode.","At its best our age is an age of searchers and discoverers, and at its worst, an age that has domesticated despair and learned to live with it happily.","I don't deserve any credit for turning the other cheek as my tongue is always in it.","It is better to be young in your failures than old in your successes.","The writer can choose what he writes about but he cannot choose what he is able to make live.","When a book leaves your hands, it belongs to God. He may use it to save a few souls or to try a few others, but I think that for the writer to worry is to take over God's business.","I am not afraid that the book will be controversial, I'm afraid it will not be controversial.","I am a writer because writing is the thing I do best.","When in Rome, do as you done in Milledgeville.","I find that most people know what a story is until they sit down to write one.","Writing a novel is a terrible experience, during which the hair often falls out and the teeth decay.","Everywhere I go, I'm asked if I think the universities stifle writers. My opinion is that they don't stifle enough of them.","Manners are of such great consequence to the novelist that any kind will do. Bad manners are better than no manners at all, and because we are losing our customary manners, we are probably overly conscious of them; this seems to be a condition that produces writers.","The writer should never be ashamed of staring. There is nothing that does not require his attention.","The Southerner is usually tolerant of those weaknesses that proceed from innocence.","I don't have my novel outlined, and I have to write to discover what I am doing. Like the old lady, I don't know so well what I think until I see what I say; then I have to say it over again."],"Flavius Josephus":["I was myself brought up with my brother, whose name was Matthias, for he was my own brother, by both father and mother; and I made mighty proficiency in the improvements of my learning, and appeared to have both a great memory and understanding.","Now, my father Matthias was not only eminent on account of is nobility, but had a higher commendation on account of his righteousness, and was in great reputation in Jerusalem, the greatest city we have.","Now Herod was an active man, and soon found proper materials for his active spirit to work upon.","Yet did that Antiochus, who was also called Dionysius, become an origin of troubles again."],"Flavor Flav":["If anyone wants to know what the definition of 'dope' means, it's: 'Definition of Public Enemy.'","I'll tell you one thing you can't do: you can't put your shoes on, then your socks on.","I just want to show the world it's never too late to get your diploma, and show kids they should stay in school and not wait until you're old to get it.","Remember the diner in 'Happy Days?' I do want to do a show like that. But an updated version.","I remember rap music. We used to party and dance off of it. Today it's all about a whole different angle... Rappers are going against each other, and it's more of a bragging, boasting thing.","The hype man's job is to get everybody out of their seats and on the dance floor to have a good time.","One thing you can't do with babies, you can't give them steak.","Since 1987, when I got my first one, I've been wearing a clock around my neck 24/7. You feel me? 24/7.","I wear my Viking helmet because the horns define how sharp my brains are. If you try to rub me the wrong way, I will stick you with both of my horns.","The moments we have behind us, you won't be able to see again. We're only responsible for what we live in right now.","My chicken ain't no joke. I ain't scared to go up against the Colonel, tastewise.","I try and spend a lot of time with my kids. I try and have fun with my kids. I try to put father time in there.","I grew up playing about 15 instruments and the way that I was able to accomplish that was by cutting my classes, hanging out in the band room all day, and going from one instrument to the next to the next, until I learned how to play everything by ear.","Best advice that I ever got is to do whatever it takes to make myself happy, so that I'll be able to make others happy. If I'm not happy, I can't make other people happy.","I got a lot happening, a whole lot, and it's not always easy being me.","Honestly, Flav is not much of a video game player these days. BUT, I used to spend hours on Time Crisis. I beat all levels, man.","I'm a real big celebrity. I'm this megastar.","When I was in jail, I was a lot of people's favorite person. I practically ran the jail. I had more freedom than the police.","I know I have a hit show on my hands.","I'm trying to grow. I don't want to stay on the same page.","I ain't scared to do another dating show, but I ain't really trying to. I want to do a talk show or something. I've done enough dating on television. I'm ready to spread my wings, and go down other avenues.","Your man Flavor Flav is living!","I set our house on fire when I was a little child playing with lighters. Boy, did I burn the place down!","I look more to the future. That's where my head is at.","If I do look back, I'll say that I'm blessed. I'm blessed, and I appreciate God for not only letting me live through everything, but to prosper.","Hip-hop is when you have crowd participation; when you chant at the audience and they chant back at you; when you wave your hands in the air like you just don't care; or some breakdancing. Everything today is just low-beat, real bass-y, bass-y, good rap records.","Queen Latifah used to help me out with my kids, because while we were all out on tour - Public Enemy, Naughty By Nature, Queen Latifah, Heavy D - when Public Enemy went onstage, I didn't have anybody solid to watch my kids. So, Latifah would help me out.","We never broke up. As long as I'm living and as long as Chuck D is living, Public Enemy is always going to be alive.","Doing scripted acting is a challenge to me. I can't remember things too good, so remembering lines is a challenge to your boy.","I'm not doing no more 'Flavor of Loves.' I'm trying to grow. I don't want to stay on the same page. You can't stay on the same page in order to get to the next chap.","I've taken a lot of time to build up the name Flavor Flav, but this could come tumbling down in 30 seconds. If you want to keep what you worked for hard all your life, then you got to do the right thing in your life.","I got my degree in culinary arts in 1978.","Back in the day, cooking definitely was the thing where you could make a lot of money. Also, it was something that I liked to do.","I worked as a head cook at courthouses and high schools. I left it behind when I started getting into my music real heavy.","My parents owned a soul food diner. It inspired me to go to culinary school.","What I'm trying to do is put back into rap music what's missing - which is the good part, the fun part, that party part.","I got a way to get through to kids. I try to take that and use that to my advantage. If we work on the kids right now, I'm telling you, they'll be making less mistakes, the jails will be gettin' less full. It's all about what we do with the kids.","Definitely, I think I'm a life coach for real. The lessons I give are lessons you can take to the bank.","Back in the day, when the D.J. would be playing a record, I'd be on the mic trying to hype up the crowd. So once Public Enemy became a rap group, I decided that that's the role that I wanted to take on. I wanted to be the one that was hyping, because I've always been good at it. I can hype up any crowd.","I have over a hundred clocks. I've got fancy clocks and clocks from all over the world that people made for me."],"Flea":["If you live a rebellious lifestyle, then you rebel against things because they go against your ideals and the integrity of who you are as a person.","Anything worth doing good takes a little chaos.","Ethiopia is such a great country, beautiful place.","As a musician I'm about expressing what's inside, and I think everyone has a song in them that they need to get out, whatever their gig is.","I'm a performer and have managed to get my performing into the mainstream consciousness of the world, I guess.","For me, music was the only reason I went to school. I was kind of a street kid, in a lot of trouble committing crimes and stuff. Music gave me something to focus on.","We were these arty punks from Hollywood. I considered myself an intellectual.","We must improvise, and we must experiment, and we must do things that might go wrong, and everything we bring - the people and the equipment - must serve us in that goal.","I love my life and my mistakes and my triumphs - all of it.","Before every show, we get into a circle, hold hands, and someone makes a speech. Most bands are too cool for that.","Later in high school, I met Hillel Slovak, who was the original guitar player of the Chili Peppers, and we became really close. We had a band, and we didn't like the bass player, so I started playing bass, and I got a bass two weeks later.","I feel creatively vibrant. I have some great friends; I feel like I'm capable of giving a lot to the world. And ultimately, that's what I really care about, is just giving.","I was on a path that could've really led to disaster, and the one thing for me that really kept me focused and gave me something to believe in and a sense of self-worth and a discipline was music.","Music gave me something that was not only good for me - it gave me something to work on, something to be proud of and something that I really loved and have a love for - but also music was good for other people because you put joy into the world.","It's so easy to fall into a comfortable groove in life where you do the things that you like, and because of that, often times, we don't grow or change because we're not pushing ourselves.","After running for a while, things really start to open up in your body. I felt like I'd tapped into parts of my body that I hadn't before. I let things in the universe flow through me that opened me up in a really cool way.","I like the idea of acting. Of all these things I've done, sometimes I think I've done well, and sometimes I think I didn't do well, but they are more cameos, and I come in and be crazy.","I started playing trumpet when I was 11 years old. All I wanted to be was a jazz trumpet player when I grew up.","A big part of my life is music education because it changed my life - but arts, academics and athletics should all be equally treated in the school.","The most important thing to me with any politician is that they don't start wars, but education is a big part of that, too, because educated people are less likely to do stupid, violent things.","It's fun to just get out there and have a nice conversation when I'm running. To be honest, when I do longer runs, the trail that I like to run up in Malibu has mountain lions, so I always feel I want to run with someone else.","Music is like the genius of humankind, universal... People who have never really taken the time to get into music, their lives are a lot smaller. Kids deserve the richness and dimension of it in their lives.","You teach your kids about your beliefs and tell them what you think is right and the conclusions that you've come to from living in the world, and then they can make their own decisions.","I went to school and studied music for a year at USC, which unlocked a bunch of doors for me in terms of my relationship to music.","All I knew about Ethiopia was from a few records that I like, as well as what I read about the famine. But you get there and it's another world. It's filled with art and music and poetry and intellectuals and writers - all kinds of people.","Running opened up something beautiful in my life. I try to send the energy all over my body. I love the feeling of it.","When you make music, you're forming these invisible vibrations in the air into different shapes and consistencies and speeds in order to create music, and understanding how the math of that works just gives you more colors to paint with, and allows you to get to what you want quicker.","My father was out of my life when I was pretty young - when I was 7 years old, he was gone. I didn't see him for the rest of my childhood.","I got my love of jazz from my stepfather, who was a jazz musician.","I was raised to think that rock was music for ignorant people who didn't think for themselves.","For me it's the high-water mark of American culture - not so much contemporary jazz, which has become kind of academic, but the jazz from the '20s on through the '70s.","Being a dad and being in the Red Hot Chili Peppers and all the stuff I have to do... The trumpet requires a lot of diligence, and I haven't had the time.","When something comes up, and it's interesting, and I have the time, I'll do it.","I wanted to play in a band, and I wanted to do music for a living, and that's what I dedicated my life to.","I studied chord theory and started playing the piano.","We always write way more than we put on a record. We always write a lot-lot.","The quality of instruction is very high at the Silverlake Conservatory of Music. It's not about being a rock star. It's about the fundamentals of music, theory and technique on a particular instrument, and playing in an ensemble or private setting.","With acting, I always feel conscious of what I'm doing.","I grew up with all these old jazz guys in the '70s in L.A., and they grew up idolizing Charlie Parker, Charles Mingus, Lester Young - all of these incredible musicians.","We were at the dark end of the L.A. punk scene, and that scene was full-on and violent and aggressive and wild and intense.","The apparatus has to serve our improbability and improvisation. Being good and playing the songs is not enough.","I love literature deeply. I view books as sacred things, and in writing my story, I'm going to do my best to honor the form that has played such a huge part in shaping who I am.","I exercise; I have a big career. I'm a parent, and I run a music school.","I always thought I was a pretty terrible actor.","I just lucked into this weird, little obscure cameoesque film career. I just love being a part of film history.","The last thing that should happen is funding cut for education; it should be increased. We need to put more money towards education, and anything else is abusive.","The Silverlake Conservatory is a nonprofit music school in Los Angeles where we teach music, mostly to kids, but to people of all ages - people who are old, people with beards, all kinds of people.","Turning 50 is a little bit of a 'taking stock' moment. I feel probably a little dumber. I don't think I'm as sharp as I was when I was younger, but I'm definitely wiser and less likely to make gigantic blunders of an intellectual, spiritual, emotional or physical type.","I've always kind of been an in-the-moment kind of person. I don't think that far in advance or have any idea what's around the next corner.","I studied music at the most remedial level when I was a kid, through the Los Angeles public schools, with a little private instruction.","All my career, all that I've really done has been based on emotion and intuition and gravitating toward what sounds good.","Music is made up out of these building blocks. Studying how these blocks go together and what they consist of and the math of how it works - it's all the same stuff; it's just different aesthetics that we're talking about.","I feel like if we're not running, we're basically disrespecting our bodies. When you're running, you're really using your body for what it's meant to do.","When I'm at home, I just run all the time, you know; I get up, and I go pretty much four days a week outdoors. I go in the canyons around L.A., Malibu - just around L.A. there's a lot of different spots.","Water is my main state. If I time before I run - like, to digest, like, a good hour and a half or so to digest, I'll eat oatmeal. but I'm a vegetarian for the most part, so in general, I just eat grains and vegetables and fruit.","I worked full time jobs, basically doing manual labor until I could make enough money supporting myself as a musician.","I did record a bunch of stuff, but the thing that usually stops me from doing that is that I'm a terrible singer. I made a bunch of instrumental music, and it feels really good, but just as a singer, I'm not good.","Bands develop their own weird ways of doing things.","Lucky enough, through the public school system, I had been able to have some music education, and that gave me something to focus on, and discipline - like a family to feel part of. There was a healthy family.","When I was in school, you could pick any instrument you want, and they'd teach you how to play it. That changed my life. I loved playing music in school, and it sent me on my path as a musician.","About 13-14 years ago, I went back to my alma mater, Fairfax High School, and ran into the music teacher. She invited me to come speak to the kids about the viability of a music career. When I went into the room where I used to play every day in a big orchestra, they had nothing!","Just so people know, the Silverlake Conservatory of Music is not at all about celebrity or fame or being a star. It's an academic music school.","When I was a kid, and it was time to go to college, I thought, 'College is for people who don't have the street smarts to make it on their own - get in a band, get in a van, and get rockin'.","Being a rock star isn't all it's cracked up to be, let me tell you.","I love entertaining people, I love playing music, and I love rocking like an animal. But at a certain point, you're playing gig after gig after gig, in town after town after town, and you're lying down, staring at another hotel-room ceiling, and it's like, 'I want to be home. I'm a dad. I've got kids.'","Kids deserve arts, and it's just as important as science, math, history, English or athletics.","I have a trainer, a really nice woman named Nina Greenberg, and she got me a training plan, and we go running in the canyons in Malibu. It's just beautiful up there, absolutely gorgeous. You see bobcats up there sometimes.","When I got with Nina Greenberg, I had been running for a few months already without a trainer. But then she gave me a program and guided me through my runs, showing me how to take care of myself and letting me know I should ice my legs and stretch - stuff I hadn't been doing.","Outside of a couple of times I ran without eating right or being too tired, I always feel great after I run.","I played trumpet in the school bands. I learned things I liked to play on my trumpet, but I didn't learn why this note goes with this note and why it produces that sound. Or how to create tension in the composition.","My whole musical life has been an educational process, and I'm just furthering my education and filling in the blanks. There's stuff that I want to know that I don't know.","When I was growing up, in L.A., I went to these schools, Fairfax High School, Bancroft Junior High School, and they had great music departments. I always played in the orchestra, the jazz band, the marching band.","Playing music is a beautiful thing. But listening to music is just as great.","I had a friend who had been teaching music for a long time, and he knew a bunch of teachers, so I just put up the money and started a school.","When I first heard about Twittering, I thought it was the most disgusting thing I'd ever heard of in my life. It's like the devil: the idea that your personal life is there for everybody.","I'm always put in the unfortunate position of asking people to donate money and people I know in bands to play benefit concerts and all this stuff.","Steven Adler and I played football in the street when we were 12. I remember rehearsing in my bedroom with my first band, and some kid climbed over the fence of my backyard and peeked his head in the window to see who was rocking. It was Slash.","I grew up being terrified of my parents, particularly my father figures."],"Fletcher Knebel":["Our forefathers made one mistake. What they should have fought for was representation without taxation.","It is now proved beyond doubt that smoking is one of the leading causes of statistics.","Smoking is one of the leading causes of statistics.","A decision is what a man makes when he can't find anybody to serve on a committee.","Statesmanship is harder than politics. Politics is the art of getting along with people, whereas statesmanship is the art of getting along with politicians."],"Fleur East":["I feel like I'm quite versatile. I want to do lots of different styles.","I do loads of squats with weights. It's great for your bum and legs.","I uplift people and see the good in a bad situation. The worst is I'm very critical of myself. If I do a performance, I watch it 100 times afterwards and pick it apart.","Even before I auditioned for 'X Factor' the second time, I was doing a lot of dance music.","I'd love to write with some people from the U.K., like Ed Sheeran, Emeli Sande... there's a very long list.","Even writing verses from my first album, there were songs that I didn't use because I just felt that they weren't really for me. But I think that happens naturally when you write songs. You're in a different mood in every session. There's so many songs out there that could potentially be used by other artists.","I remember, one day, I just printed out about a hundred CVs, and I was running around London. I was going to modeling agencies, temping agencies, anything. I was so desperate.","It's funny because the perception is that the typical 'X Factor' contestant is the person who's just working 9 to 5 and just decides to one day go and audition. So yeah, for me, it was a very different story.","My mum is from Ghana, and she used to play highlife music in the house, and my dad used to listen to music.","I used to just sit in the living room and make up songs on the keyboard.","I used to hate performing in front of anybody, but I was forced to sing in front of family, at family gatherings. Then it slowly developed, and I started to love it.","I'm a believer in things happening for a reason.","Everyone assumes it is just 'Wendy who works at Tesco' who goes to audition for 'X Factor,' and then their lives are changed, wham, like that. Me, I am someone who has tried for years in the music industry.","Traditionally with debut albums, labels insist on a face, so people know who you are.","I didn't grow up in a wealthy family at all. Being at home all day and watching movies, that was a luxury.","There's so much pressure, but I think if you really love it, if you truly love it, and it's your passion to sing, then that's what will get through. I think if you don't have that, you'll realise quickly.","Before going on 'X Factor' again, I felt like I'd tried everything else.","I got to the point where I'd featured on songs; I'd done backing singing for major artists. I'd done all these shows, but it was always for other people.","My mum is black, my dad is white, and when I was a teenager, people would say, 'So what are you? Are you black? Or white? What are you more of?'","I hated my big hair. I always wore it straight.","I'd done an EP, and nothing came from that, and I didn't know where to go from there.","I've worked in a call centre and as a nightclub waitress. I served champagne to Rihanna.","I normally hit the gym five times a week. I tend to do half an hour of cardio - on the treadmill or a spin class - then head for the weights. I do a lot of core work, obviously!","I've always loved working out. When I was little, my dad used to make me and my sister do 10 press-ups every day before we brushed our teeth in the morning. It was like a boot camp! Then I did a lot of athletics at school and was a dancer.","I've been hyper-conscious about staying away from rubbish. I don't eat white bread, white rice or cereal unless it's porridge.","I would never totally deny myself any specific type of food.","I do body conditioning, spinning and yoga. On the treadmill, I'll do intervals of running flat and then on incline. I'll do that for an hour.","Just before I auditioned for 'The X Factor,' there was nothing in my diary at all. I had no shows; nothing was happening. It was make-or-break time for me, and I had to consider doing another career altogether.","Everyone's path is really different, and you just have to be in the right place at the right time. 'The X Factor' gave me that chance I needed, that platform.","I've waited so long to get to this point, and I'm so happy to be making my first album. I want to be a performer and an entertainer.","I'd perform in the mirror; I'd pretend to do interviews. I'd practice my autograph for hours.","'The X Factor' was the final push I needed to have the presence and confidence on stage, which I didn't have before. It's a crash course in the music industry. If you can survive the show, you're ready for the industry.","I can't ignore what I grew up listening to. My parents used to listen to Michael Jackson non-stop. They used to listen to Luther Vandross, Lionel Richie, Stevie Wonder.","My album is very uplifting and positive and fun. That was my mission - to get people up on their feet and escape the seriousness of life.","I put pressure on myself all the time. I felt it so much with 'Sax,' but I had to just let go and enjoy it.","The attitude among the people I knew was, 'Fleur wants to be a singer' but it was never, 'Go for it. You can do it.' Everyone was cynical because we'd never seen anyone where we came from do it.","After my first video, I went out and had chicken noodle soup with my sister and manager. We were like, 'How rock n' roll are we? Celebrating the first video with chicken soup.'","I used to shop in ASDA all the time. Every now and then I still go in to get a little salad for lunch."],"Flip Wilson":["If I could marry my motorcycle, I'd roll her right up to the altar.","The secret of my success with Geraldine is that she's not a putdown of women. She's smart, she's trustful, she's loyal, she's sassy.","You can't expect to hit the jackpot if you don't put a few nickels in the machine.","I tell fans who ask me why I'm not doing comedy anymore that I'm a different person. I've grown and I've matured. I've made a transition to where I really want to be.","Get well cards have become so humorous that if you don't get sick you're missing half the fun.","The devil made me do it.","It would be ridiculous for me to say anything negative regarding blacks having an equal opportunity on TV.","I was number one in the ratings four times last year and twice this season. What could be more damn equal than that? If they get any more equal, I don't want it.","I think Mr. Wilson will have to be the rest of the way alone.","The cost of living is going up and the chance of living is going down.","Funny is an attitude.","Violence is a tool of the ignorant.","When you're hot, you're hot; when you're not, you're not.","Don't order one for the road, because the road is already laid out.","My show is my statement. What I have to say is on the screen. My life is my own. I don't want to talk about my private self. Why should I?","It's later than it's ever been.","Things can be funny only when we are in fun. When we're 'dead earnest,' humor is the only thing that is dead.","My happiest memory of childhood was my first birthday in reform school. This teacher took an interest in me. In fact, he gave me the first birthday presents I ever got: a box of Cracker Jacks and a can of ABC shoe polish.","Funny is not a color. Being black is only good from the time you get from the curtain to the microphone.","My main point is to be funny; if I can slip a message in there, fine.","I accomplished what I set out to do. I wanted the whole cookie, and I got it. Now I want to spend more time with my children - make sure they don't go through what I did.","Most drag impersonations are a drag. But women can like Geraldine, men can like Geraldine, everyone can like Geraldine.","A show hosted by a black had never been accepted, so the first time that knob's turned on, people are judging against all they have ever been taught. I may have been the first black in the house.","I study a lot of philosophy. I want to be an example of how to enjoy this success, and that's exactly what I've done. I've enjoyed every moment.","Variety shows didn't disappear; it was the caliber of the artists, the classic vaudevillians that have passed on. They are gone, so there's a different caliber performer that's come along that hasn't had the time to work in the small clubs and get the experience.","After having seen the job done on that first show of mine, I realized that I felt like I wanted to work again for a short while. Two, three years, then stop.","I told CBS, 'My career is going down the toilet, and you're pulling the chain.'","I have the bug again. I'm expecting the response to seeing the show again on Nick to be very good, and this will set the groundwork for what I want to do.","I've had all that you could ask for. The fat lady has sung, and there's a standing ovation.","Everyone in this house and the houses next door knows when I'm in the sauna because I start singing, and I sing the blues when I'm in a really good mood. I have a really loud voice, you know.","I have my outlet for my humor through my characters, and I also have the intimacy of rapport with my fans that allows me to explain my philosophy and spirituality."],"Flo Rida":["The fans are always at the hotel waiting, they like to get pictures and autographs. I enjoy it all, the displays of love and support at the hotel and the shows.","It's always overwhelming when you come to another country and you're embraced in such a positive way.","I love the energy over here in the U.K., the hospitality is insane.","I write all the time, even if it means recording in the hotel room. I write on the plane, anywhere, anytime I'm inspired or have ideas.","I wouldn't mind working with Outkast. I'm a big fan of them.","I definitely want my fans to know that I'm here to stay, and I'm going to continue to give them hot music.","I'm not the only one in the studio a lot of times, so I have my boys in there and they'll tell me and give me their suggestions and what they think.","I love my fans, so when I get the chance to interact with them, it's beautiful.","I'm a huge fan of Taio Cruz. I'm really liking what he's doing at the moment. I'd love to do something with him.","I've always known, before I had a record deal, that the thing is to go out and put on the show. I've been doing that from day one.","Music was definitely a way out. Instead of playing basketball, I was going to recording studios.","If they can go out and buy my albums, I can at least make the sacrifice to holler at the few people who call. A lot of times I'm busy so they'll get my voice mail. And if I can speak to them and I have time, I always text back. Because I think that's very important.","At the end of the day I want to be the guy who experienced music in all type of ways, with hip-hop being the roots of it.","I like to take music from everywhere and put it in my style and let it be accepted.","I'm influenced by all types of music.","I went on tour with Beyonce before. I wouldn't mind doing something with her."],"Flora Lewis":["Learning another language is not only learning different words for the same things, but learning another way to think about things.","Democracy may have arisen in the West as the way of striving for the universal aspiration to dignity and freedom, but it isn't alien to the underlying concepts that infuse religion and moral philosophy everywhere.","We have learned how to do a lot of things. We must try to relearn why.","Many, many, many small moves of many kinds can bring a way to manage change. The theory can come later.","I consider that there are different degrees of civilization and there are many different ways of expressing it. But one is civilized or is not."],"Florence Ellinwood Allen":["It will take a long time for women's effect on politics to register so that we may properly appraise it.","Each generation must recreate liberty for its own times.","Whether or not we establish freedom rests with ourselves.","The nature of the Catilinarian conspiracy was bad and bloody.","The fact that the movement was carried on by women who, for the most part, had no money of their own and were totally inexperienced in organization, and that they won their fight in about two generations, makes a story often dramatic and always worth preserving.","Owing to the fact that leaders in the women's groups made a point of serving on the jury here whenever they were called, we have always had an unusually high type of women represented on the jury.","You have had indeed a fair trial. It is a shocking thing when a judge of your high office is shown to have betrayed the truth and his honor, and I sentence you to the penitentiary.","It's so worth-while being a judge, because, if I make good, I can help prove that a woman's place is as much on the bench, in City Council, or in Congress, as in the home.","You can hardly judge women's effect on politics merely from the action of individual women officeholders."],"Florence Green":["I enjoyed my time in the WRAF. There were plenty of people at the airfields where I worked, and they were all very good company.","I met dozens of pilots and would go on dates. I had the opportunity to go up in one of the planes, but I was scared of flying."],"Florence Griffith Joyner":["A muscle is like a car. If you want it to run well early in the morning, you have to warm it up.","Conventional is not for me. I like things that are uniquely Flo. I like being different.","I don't always have the best eating habits. I like butter and ice cream. There are days when I should work out and I don't. But it's never too late to change old habits.","People want to think that staying in shape costs a lot of money. They couldn't be more wrong. It doesn't cost anything to walk. And it's probably a lot cheaper to go to the corner store and buy vegetables than take a family out for fast food.","I believe in the impossible because no one else does.","When anyone tells me I can't do anything... I'm just not listening any more.","The main reason I wanted to be successful was to get out of the ghetto. My parents helped direct my path.","If you want to run as fast as the men, you've got to train like the men.","That's what I'd like to do on the President's Council. Make sports and athletics available to every youth in America, not just one day a week like it was for me, but every day.","I like being unconventional.","I couldn't wait until I grew up. I used to look at my mom's stockings and put them on with her high heels and mess with my hair.","I was always doing something physical. My brothers and I used to have handstand contests. We'd walk around the projects on our hands and see who could get the farthest. I was always playing football with them, basketball or racing in the street.","I used to be teased for the way I wore my hair at school. I used to do things like wear a different-colored sock on each leg.","I have been running since I was 7. I was trying to restructure the way my body was made instead of trying to master the way I ran. I would get so frustrated with my starts in practices that I would just cry. When I ran, I wouldn't even try to get out of the blocks, I would just run.","I love working with kids, talking with them and listening to them. I always encourage kids to reach beyond their dreams. Don't try to be like me. Be better than me.","I don't do drugs. I never have taken any drugs. I don't believe in them.","To do justice to a lifelong dream of being a writer, I must give it the intense concentration and focus I gave to track. To do both with excellence is not possible. It is with a sense of sadness and joyous anticipation that I leave track and move on.","I've always overworked in the weight room. I love working with weights. I knew they'd give me the strength I needed."],"Florence Harding":["I have only one real hobby - my husband.","Well, Warren Harding, I have got you the presidency. What are you going to do with it?"],"Florence Henderson":["I don't ever remember not praying. Bedtime prayers, the rosary, praying for friends, relatives, for the sick and for those who had died. It was a natural part of our lives.","There is no age limit on the enjoyment of sex. It keeps getting better.","My life has never been easy. It's like all the major events of my life have always been difficult.","My children and their happiness have always been my greatest concern.","I may have more than one friend with benefits. It's very healthy for the heart. I think no matter how old you are - and I am pretty up there in terms of numbers - I think you should do whatever makes you happy.","I have four of the most incredible children. And I have five grandchildren.","Being a mom makes you far more compassionate. You have more empathy for people, more love. I was always taught to say thank you, and I'm very grateful. And my kids have that quality, too.","I frequently am contacted by people who want to thank me for 'The Brady Bunch.' Whether they grew up during the show's original television run or are brand-new fans of the present generation, they tell me how important 'The Brady Bunch' has been in their lives.","You don't get happy by sitting around going on, 'Oh this is a horrible situation, what to do?' You've got to find the courage to change that. I think change is extremely hard for people.","I still get so much fan mail addressed to Carol Brady, and I think a lot of it's through the Net. And I always answer it, if it's legible.","It's so important to keep moving and don't buy into the myth. I say do anything you feel like as long as you don't hurt yourself or hurt anyone else. And things don't stop working in your body or your mind.","When I first went to New York I was right out of high school, I was 17 years old, and I had never seen a building over two stories high.","I started in live television and I've done a lot of live TV and that's really the thing that I love best. I love flying by the seat of my pants.","I'm a '70s mom, and my daughter is a '90s mom. I know a lot of women my age who are real computer freaks.","It was in 1969, and I thought, wow, you know, I really didn't want to do a TV series. You know, I had my own act, and I was performing in Vegas and doing all of these exciting things.","I don't know that I would want to be married again, but I do love companionship.","For me, 'The Brady Bunch' is just a part of the fabric of my career, but for a lot of people, that's it.","I do think children come in wired a certain way. Why else would I be filled with hope and optimism? You just could not keep me down for very long. You can call it grace or a gift from God, but I do think I came in with it.","I had an instinct to gravitate towards people who were smarter than I was, teachers that were nice people that were trying to do things in life that were constructive, and that's what I gravitated to instead of what I saw and what I was in.","I don't remember ever not singing. My mother loved music, and she taught me songs, country music, spirituals. I would sing for people and pass the hat when I was 4.","A lot of women say to me, 'You know, I really hated you because my kids wanted you to be their mother.'","I grew up in a very large, poor family.","If you want to wear long hair or wear that dress, as long as you're not hurting yourself or anybody else, I say do it. If you want to go out and have a romantic, sexy affair, do it."],"Florence Kelley":["In order to be rated as good as a good man in the field of her earnings, she must show herself better than he. She must be more steady, or more trustworthy, or more skilled, or more cheap in order to have the same chance of employment.","It is fatal for any body of workers to have forever hanging from the fringes of its skirts other bodies on a level just below its own; for that means continual pressure downward, additional difficulty to be overcome in the struggle to maintain reasonable rates of wages.","In the garment trades, on the other hand, the presence of a body of the disfranchised, of the weak and young, undoubtedly contributes to the economic weakness of these trades.","This position is untenable, and there can be no pause in the agitation for full political power and responsibility until these are granted to all the women of the nation.","The very fact that women now form about one-fifth of the employes in manufacture and commerce in this country has opened a vast field of industrial legislation directly affecting women as wage-earners.","The workingmen have perceived that women are in the field of industry to stay; and they see, too, that there can not be two standards of work and wages for any trade without constant menace to the higher standard.","Hence, within the space of two generations there has been a complete revolution in the attitude of the trades-unions toward the women working in their trades.","Their effort to place the women upon the same industrial level with themselves in order that all may pull together in the effort to maintain reasonable conditions of life.","On the one hand, she is cut off from the protection awarded to her sisters abroad; on the other, she has no such power to defend her interests at the polls, as is the heritage of her brothers at home."],"Florence King":["True nostalgia is an ephemeral composition of disjointed memories.","In social matters, pointless conventions are not merely the bee sting of etiquette, but the snake bite of moral order.","The witty woman is a tragic figure in American life. Wit destroys eroticism and eroticism destroys wit, so women must choose between taking lovers and taking no prisoners.","To achieve the very pinnacle of good taste, the neoclassicists wrote their plays entirely in alexandrine verse, a rarefied meter that is uniquely tailored to the French language and fits no other.","People are so busy dreaming the American Dream, fantasizing about what they could be or have a right to be, that they're all asleep at the switch. Consequently we are living in the Age of Human Error.","Writers, not psychiatrists, are the true interpreters of the human mind and heart, and we have been at it for a very long time.","Now the only thing I miss about sex is the cigarette afterward. Next to the first one in the morning, it's the best one of all. It tasted so good that even if I had been frigid I would have pretended otherwise just to be able to smoke it.","American couples have gone to such lengths to avoid the interference of in-laws that they have to pay marriage counselors to interfere between them.","I'd rather rot on my own floor than be found by a bunch of bingo players in a nursing home.","He travels fastest who travels alone, and that goes double for she. Real feminism is spinsterhood.","Showing up at school already able to read is like showing up at the undertaker's already embalmed: people start worrying about being put out of their jobs.","Americans worship creativity the way they worship physical beauty - as a way of enjoying elitism without guilt: God did it.","Time has lost all meaning in that nightmare alley of the Western world known as the American mind.","Writers who have nothing to say always strain for metaphors to say it in."],"Florence Nightingale":["I attribute my success to this - I never gave or took any excuse.","If I could give you information of my life, it would be to show how a woman of very ordinary ability has been led by God in strange and unaccustomed paths to do In His service what He has done in her. And if I could tell you all, you would see how God has done all, and I nothing.","The greatest heroes are those who do their duty in the daily grind of domestic affairs whilst the world whirls as a maddening dreidel.","I think one's feelings waste themselves in words; they ought all to be distilled into actions which bring results.","God spoke to me and called me to His Service. What form this service was to take the voice did not say.","Wise and humane management of the patient is the best safeguard against infection.","The most important practical lesson that can be given to nurses is to teach them what to observe - how to observe - what symptoms indicate improvement - what the reverse - which are of importance - which are of none - which are the evidence of neglect - and of what kind of neglect.","If a patient is cold, if a patient is feverish, if a patient is faint, if he is sick after taking food, if he has a bed-sore, it is generally the fault not of the disease, but of the nursing.","How very little can be done under the spirit of fear.","Live your life while you have it. Life is a splendid gift. There is nothing small in it. Far the greatest things grow by God's law out of the smallest. But to live your life, you must discipline it.","So never lose an opportunity of urging a practical beginning, however small, for it is wonderful how often in such matters the mustard-seed germinates and roots itself.","Every nurse ought to be careful to wash her hands very frequently during the day. If her face, too, so much the better.","A dark house is always an unhealthy house, always an ill-aired house, always a dirty house. Want of light stops growth and promotes scrofula, rickets, etc., among the children. People lose their health in a dark house, and if they get ill, they cannot get well again in it.","I have learned to know God. I have recast my social belief... All my admirers are married; most of my friends are dead; and I stand with all the world before me, where to choose a path to make in it.","It may seem a strange principle to enunciate as the very first requirement in a hospital that it should do the sick no harm.","Were there none who were discontented with what they have, the world would never reach anything better.","Why do people sit up so late, or, more rarely, get up so early? Not because the day is not long enough, but because they have no time in the day to themselves.","A hundred struggle and drown in the breakers. One discovers the new world. But rather, ten times rather, die in the surf, heralding the way to that new world, than stand idly on the shore.","The martyr sacrifices themselves entirely in vain. Or rather not in vain; for they make the selfish more selfish, the lazy more lazy, the narrow narrower.","Everything you do in a patient's room, after he is 'put up' for the night, increases tenfold the risk of his having a bad night. But, if you rouse him up after he has fallen asleep, you do not risk - you secure him a bad night.","Women have no sympathy and my experience of women is almost as large as Europe.","Never speak to an invalid from behind, nor from the door, nor from any distance from him, nor when he is doing anything. The official politeness of servants in these things is so grateful to invalids, that many prefer, without knowing why, having none but servants about them.","The world is put back by the death of every one who has to sacrifice the development of his or her peculiar gifts to conventionality.","She said the object and color in the materials around us actually have a physical effect on us, on how we feel.","Badly constructed houses do for the healthy what badly constructed hospitals do for the sick. Once insure that the air in a house is stagnant, and sickness is certain to follow.","The very elements of what constitutes good nursing are as little understood for the well as for the sick. The same laws of health or of nursing, for they are in reality the same, obtain among the well as among the sick.","Do not meet or overtake a patient who is moving about in order to speak to him or to give him any message or letter. You might just as well give him a box on the ear. I have seen a patient fall flat on the ground who was standing when his nurse came into the room.","Sick children, if not too shy to speak, will always express this wish. They invariably prefer a story to be told to them, rather than read to them.","I have lived and slept in the same bed with English countesses and Prussian farm women... no woman has excited passions among women more than I have."],"Florence Scovel Shinn":["Every great work, every big accomplishment, has been brought into manifestation through holding to the vision, and often just before the big achievement, comes apparent failure and discouragement.","Giving opens the way for receiving.","You will be a failure, until you impress the subconscious with the conviction you are a success. This is done by making an affirmation which 'clicks.'","The game of life is a game of boomerangs. Our thoughts, deeds and words return to us sooner or later with astounding accuracy.","No man is a success in business unless he loves his work.","There is a supply for every demand.","Intuition is a spiritual faculty and does not explain, but simply points the way."],"Florence Welch":["I'm completely in love with the world but also terrified of it. It creates some overwhelming feelings. Wanting to battle out that joy and fear is part of my music.","I've got quite a vivid imagination and I'm easily overwhelmed by sensations and things that are beautiful or scary. I don't think I've ever seen a ghost - I think I'm probably haunted by my own ghosts than real ones.","I love performing outside because it's as if the heavens are open and the elements become part of the stage show as well - you know, the wind and the rain and the thunder. It's almost as if there's a sense of invocation in performance.","There's such an extreme feeling to be in love, especially in quite an emotionally destructive relationship, where you're both kind of really bad for each other, but you love each other so much. Those extreme emotions, I think, can only be described with extreme imagery.","I like the idea of taking off like a bird.","When you're heartbroken, you're at your most creative - you have to channel all your energies into something else to not think about it. Contentment is a creativity killer, but don't worry - I'm very capable of making myself discontented.","You should have high expectations for yourself and others should come second.","Bono told me how to dance in high heels and he also told me about U2's Glastonbury performance and how everything that could have possibly gone wrong went wrong, including him ripping his trousers on stage. I think he was lunging and his trousers ripped! He was telling me how he had to find a new way of performing that didn't involve moving.","My siblings and I were friends with the boys who would become our stepbrothers - we grew up on the same street. I feel very special to have these amazing people in my life and if we hadn't all moved into this big house together I think I would have missed out on that, because we would have drifted apart.","I can't ever seem to shake the feeling that when things are really good it essentially means that things are going to go really bad. When I feel calm and settled, there is always an underlying feeling of impending doom... I don't think that it's healthy.","I look really odd in jeans and a hoodie - it doesn't feel or seem right.","Music is my way out. I keep things locked up and never say anything. I guess in order to say something to one person, I have to sing it to a couple of thousand. It doesn't make for healthy relationships.","If you asked me to go back to being 14 or 15, I couldn't - it was a terrifying time. I was so awkward in my own skin. I used to hide behind my hair because I was so ridiculously self-conscious.","I'm a choir girl gone horribly, desperately wrong.","I've learned not to hide behind a veil of irony - to talk about my work in a more honest way.","I have this sensation of being in flight all the time, but being on stage is like creating a sanctuary in which you can completely lose yourself. The bits of your personality that you keep under wraps in ordinary life, you can let them run free.","I try to write lyrics so that they won't age, which sort of leaves you with the big subjects like death and love and sex and violence.","I get in fights with my sister all the time. She comes on the road with me and we fight - like sisters do.","I've always been a bit of a decorator. I think if I wasn't a singer I'd probably be in stage setting or interior design or something. I like clutter and I'm quite visually greedy. I can't have things to be plain; I have to have things looking interesting... maybe I'm just a frustrated interior designer stuck in a singing career.","The sense of jubilee for music and what we're making is always genuine.","I started off singing in church as a child. The sound of voices coming together, that was my first moment of touching something outside of myself.","I've got my ideal job. I like to sing, I like to dance, I like to bang drums and dress up, and someone pays me - it's incredible.","You know, people always ask, 'What are you like offstage?' And I always say, 'Well, I'm completely normal and mellow.'","On stage, you can use your emotions. It's the place where you can channel them. They have a purpose.","What I really like seeing from the stage is people having their own moments, when people are doing some performance of their own.","I've got some incredible fans actually - so loyal and they make me birthday cards and Christmas cards. I got this package of poems and artwork based around the songs. They've got this thing called 'Floetry' where they all have to put in artwork. They've set up their own competitions and stuff which is kind of amazing.","I saw 'The Artist.' It's really beautiful and it's all done to the letter with all the silent film techniques. The costumes were amazing and the dog is so good.","I've always been able to just concoct a melody quite easily - it's just kind of instinct, really. You've got to channel your subconscious.","I've just never been a tracksuit-wearer.","I'm quite glad I never learned to play the guitar, because I think I'd write songs that were more classically structured. As it is, I've had to create my own way of writing, which isn't typical. Everything's a big crescendo.","I'd experimented with so many different types of music. I had these folky songs I'd written and recorded, but something wasn't quite right.","Touring, and being in a band, it's almost like the other stuff, the other parts of life, get put on hold.","I am obsessed with the whole Victoriana thing, the whole Jack the Ripper London era, the grayness of it, the haunted feeling of it, all ancient and bloody.","When something really hits me, it makes me want to either jump off something really high or lie down and be buried. I want people to get hit and caught by my music.","I can't wait to get on stage, because there you don't worry about whether you'll ever get married because your life is insane, or whether you'll ever have another boyfriend again, you don't worry about the typical boundaries of how your life has to be.","My style of playing is more enthusiasm and instinct than skill.","When you play, it's like you know that there are people out there who are hearing it for the first time, and I think that's really important.","I think I just get excited by music, and, like, singing is a very physical thing. It releases endorphins in your body. You're using almost muscle in there, and I think that adrenaline really helps to kind of make the songs fresh every time.","I always seem to feel that everything is about to cave in on me. I think that maybe music is my protection from that and in some senses it's an outlet to turn it into something euphoric: embracing the eventual decline.","Maybe in music you're making an auditory environment and maybe you change your environment around you to suit your own way.","I've been having this really weird anxiety dream about arriving too late or too early, and the people in charge are like, 'You have to leave! You have to go back to the hotel and get ready!' And I use the wrong exit, and I'm running down the red carpet in pyjamas, like, 'No! Don't look at me!'","The aesthetic came along the way, I think - just through experimenting, and going on tour, and trying stuff out on stage, having fun with it, and not taking it too seriously. If I had a ballgown at home, I'd wear it onstage. If I found something in a charity shop, I'd wear it. That's where it grew from - just wanting to play dress-up.","My room is like an antique shop, full of junk, and weird stuff. There's a big sword in there. And a taxidermy bird, and a couple of birdcages. And a lot of newspaper cuttings. I used to have a weird thing about cutting out morbid headlines from newspapers, and collecting them. I was fascinated with drowning, which is kind of strange.","Going to parties usually makes me feel depressed, just because I have such social fear after meeting people.","I'm a light sleeper. I've never been one of those people who can put their head down and suddenly everything disappears. Nighttime is the time I get most scared, anxious or worried. In those darker moments before waking or sleeping is when I feel most, I don't know, I can turn on myself, and my imagination can take me dark places.","I feel things in quite an intense way. I'm not actually the most intense person.","I'm just a black hole for stuff. No one should ever hand me anything, because I get so easily distracted. I'll be like, 'Oh, look, something shiny!' I'm glad I never learned how to drive. I would be really dangerous.","I'd gone from being this art student messing about with music to this girl with a record deal, magazine front covers and all this hype. In many ways, it was everything I ever wanted, but when it happened all I felt was total, paralysing fear.","During the songs, you transcend yourself. The best way to be in the performance is to be without pause and be essentially in the moment, in that moment of expression.","I think I should get a bigger between-the-song persona, so then I'm not wandering around the stage like some mad old auntie that's saying hello to people and falling over.","It would be too frightening for me to consider myself a role model. But I like the idea of not being afraid of letting your imagination rule you, to feel the freedom of expression, to let creativity be your overwhelming drive rather than other things.","I'm one of those people that is up for most things. When I was offered to sing at the Oscars I was like, 'Yeah, I want to know what that's like!' I'm always curious to know what things are like - as long as you're not compromising who you are.","My mum wanted me to go to university.","I love that sense of release as you throw yourself into the crowd as hundreds of arms are carrying you.","I've built my wardrobe color palette around red, so I'm happy with it, but I do get pangs when I see beautiful brunettes. I've already been blue, green, black, and blonde.","I used to dress like an eight-year-old boy. Traveling has inspired me to be more experimental.","When I'm singing I'm always trying to get to the highest point possible. I'd fly to the top of Buckingham Palace to sing to the queen.","I like to wear clothes that I will wear when I am an old lady.","I've always been attracted to romantic secondhand clothes. But my style developed as I started going to these strange raves where everybody had these very definitive costumes.","Look, if Givenchy is going to lend you a dress, I'm not going to turn it down. I would wear that dress to just go out and buy a pint of milk if they would lend it to me.","I'm really careful with what the music gets put with, and we say no to so much stuff, loads of it, for things that might quadruple the sales of my album. But if it doesn't fit then it doesn't fit, you know?","I made music with my friend, who we called Isabella Machine to which I was Florence Robot. When I was about an hour away from my first gig, I still didn't have a name, so I thought 'Okay, I'll be Florence Robot/Isa Machine', before realising that name was so long it'd drive me mad.","I'm pretty obsessed with Stevie Nicks from her style to her voice. I like watching her on YouTube and her old performances, the way she moves and everything.","The first album, for better or for worse, was done over from the ages of 17-22, with a couple of different producers. Some of it was recorded in an old swimming pool, some of it was recorded in a synagogue - it kind of was all over the place.","The Teenage Cancer Trust does incredible work supporting and caring for teenagers and young adults with cancer, and it's a cause that is really close to me and my family.","I dyed my hair red when I was ten and when I was 11 - in my goth period - I dyed it black and I was really into witchcraft. I made mini shrines in my bedroom with candles and tried to cast spells to make the boy in the next class fall in love with me. I don't think he did.","I think an encore is perfectly acceptable, but I find it so weird when people do two or three.","I quite like the drama of an encore. I think an encore is for those artists who are inclined to do dramatic gestures, and I certainly would say I am inclined towards them.","I got to live out my 11-year-old fantasies - I got to go on stage with Green Day. Billie Joe called my name from the stage. 'Dookie' was the first album I ever bought. I covered the whole of 'Nimrod' and he'd heard it. That was like the 11-year-old girl dreamed.","I'm down to bleach my eyebrows again. I tell you what, though - that didn't go down well with my boyfriend. Girls love it. Guys, not so into it.","'Spectrum' is in part a disco song. But we play it hard, and it's a real euphoric, wailing tune. It's kind of like a total house anthem, in a way, but it seems to be going down really well. We've got all the grunge kids going mad for disco house raves.","Growing up, I always wanted to be in punk bands, so I'm really enjoying the harder, heavier element. It's always been my dream to have people moshing at my gig, kind of that really feral element of the music coming out more. I love crowd-surfing.","When I first started, especially because I got the Critics' Choice before I'd released an album, there was a lot of scrutiny on what my character was, what my background was, what colour my hair was. I fought quite hard for the music to overtake the personality aspect.","I didn't want to become a personality, I wanted to be a musician, but because I didn't have an album to stand by yet it was hard for people to see that. But now, two albums in, I'm happy with things.","The stage is a place where I can be wholly myself. Even though you're in front of people almost to be judged, it is a place without judgement.","I was having a conversation with my father and he was talking about this thing - strangeness and charm. It's actually the name of the two smallest particles that there are when you split the atom, so I wrote a song around it. I even managed to fit the word 'hydrogen' in there. Isn't that a nice thing for scientists to call them though?","I love Lady Gaga and I love Katy Perry and R&B and rap music... I love big, American pop music.","When making the first album, I think I wrote a song about every six months. The first album was so much about the vocals carrying it.","I think music should be scary. Music is an exorcism.","I always wanted to sound like a man, like Jeff Buckley or Tom Waits.","'Dog Days' was recorded with pens and the wall, and half a stolen drum kit that was out of tune, in what was basically a cupboard. The only instrument I could really play was my voice, so we just layered everything a hundred times. It was enthusiasm over skill.","I definitely have a real self-destructive streak.","The release of 'Lungs' was so hard. It was terrifying, because it was the first time doing everything. The first experiences of media exposure were almost paralysing. I spent a lot of time crying on the floor of the studio - it sent me a bit mad.","At the beginning of my career I was going through a really weird phase of dressing in boys clothes. I would only wear one American Apparel T-shirt and shorts and brogues the whole year round. Not the same T-shirt, obviously, but one style of American Apparel T-shirt. I think I was going through a tomboy stage.","But I was always much more interested in reading fashion magazines than I was music magazines when I was a teenager. Just that sense of romanticism and escapism and the dream of it has always been quite alluring to me, as well as that sense of becoming a character through clothes.","Music to me is so internal. It's physical and it's emotional. Whereas fashion is so much about the external that it's almost like a break. It's not inner turmoil. It's total escapism.","Music can tear me up inside.","When I am with my family, then I can just sort of switch off. It's kind of weird, because I go back and I go into this bedroom that I have had since I was a teenager. It is like this parallel universe, because one minute I am on the red carpet and then the next I am hiding out in this room I have had since I was 15.","I feel a responsibility to the fans who have paid to see me and I want to give as good a show as I possibly can.","It's very flattering when you look into the crowd and people have made an effort and dressed in your style."],"Florentijn Hofman":["I've always said the rubber duck is a yellow catalyst.","'The Moon Rabbit' is laying against the bunker, dreaming and thinking about life and dreaming the impossible possible and creating its own true stories.","I really hate rubber ducks, actually.","I make work a bit like how you mix cocktails - with ingredients like budget, history and location.","I make big objects that are simple, bright and clear, kind of ironic but hopefully funny because I love the shapes, and I get inspiration from toys and books, and I believe in art for everyone.","If you work in a public space, you have to be aware that no one is buying a ticket.","I want people to get inspired by public space - their space. People tend to forget about it because they do the daily thing, but putting up these sculptures breaks the routine.","My sculptures cause an uproar, astonishment, and put a smile on your face.","The Internet is fascinating but also stupid in a way. You only see two-dimensional images, and you think you've seen it and know it.","I love it when people travel to see one of my works, and I always make time to meet and talk with them.","That is the effect of my sculptures in the public domain: people are making contact with each other again.","I make work not to give answers but to question things.","I wanted to use the hippo to get people out of their homes, away from the Internet and the TV, and to explore London with a new perspective.","The slugs are ascending this steep city staircase that leads up to a huge Catholic church, essentially signifying their slow crawl towards death. The work reminds us of religion, mortality, natural decay, and the slow suffocation of commercialized societies.","I used to get a lot of rubber ducks on my birthdays as presents because, you know, I make rubber ducks. But then I get the ugliest ones with a neck, ugly colors, and devil ears. I don't like those.","I think places that need the rubber duck the most are the ones in distress.","In Holland, we have a saying: 'A knife cuts on two sides.' With the rubber duck, I'm trying to show people what they haven't been seeing in their public space. When the rubber duck is there and when it's gone, you know."],"Florenz Ziegfeld":["Curtain! Fast music! Light! Ready for the last finale! Great! The show looks good, the show looks good!","And, I may add, from what totally unexpected sources come many of those who from the comparatively modest beginning in the chorus rise to the heights of really great achievement in the theatrical profession.","Beauty, of course, is the most important requirement and the paramount asset of the applicant.","It is the task of several months and it is a fact that a girl, either while rehearsing or actually playing, may be training for some character or feature in some future production not yet definitely fixed even in my own mind.","They all hope I will go broke and I wouldn't like to cause them displeasure.","But it is only through constant, faithful endeavor by the girl herself that the goal eventually is reached.","Half of the great comedians I've had in my shows and that I paid a lot of money to and who made my customers shriek were not only not funny to me, but I couldn't understand why they were funny to anybody.","How little the public realizes what a girl must go through before she finally appears before the spotlight that is thrown upon the stage.","I don't have a very quick sense of humor.","Let us hope that for many it does mean the end of trouble so far as earning a livelihood is concerned, that it means happy and comfortable home living honestly earned. But there are other troubles ahead for her, and plenty of hard work.","Not only may she unconsciously register a favorable impression with my associates and me, but she may also suggest something by her work that will lead to some new and novel feature in a forthcoming production.","To illustrate what I mean, an apt dancer may be in thorough unison with the others in that particular group, and at the same time reveal a difference in dancing temperament, rhythm or technique; she may phrase, accentuate or actually interpret differently.","Yes, there is plenty of hard work for them in addition to that which they do when they appear, smiling and happy, when the curtain goes up. Giving a performance is the least of their worries."],"Floriana Lima":["I may have the 'Twilight: Breaking Dawn' soundtrack, which I've been told is embarrassing, but come on, there are some good songs on there.","Any kind of peanut butter/chocolate concoction is my jam."],"Florida Scott-Maxwell":["No matter how old a mother is she watches her middle-aged children for signs of improvement.","The crucial task of old age is balance: keeping just well enough, just brave enough, just gay and interested and starkly honest enough to remain a sentient human being.","Life does not accommodate you, it shatters you. It is meant to, and it couldn't do it better. Every seed destroys its container or else there would be no fruition.","Age puzzles me. I thought it was a quiet time. My seventies were interesting and fairly serene, but my eighties are passionate. I grow more intense as I age.","It is not easy to be sure that being yourself is worth the trouble, but we do know it is our sacred duty.","My kitchen linoleum is so black and shiny that I waltz while I wait for the kettle to boil. This pleasure is for the old who live alone."],"Florynce Kennedy":["If men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament.","Everybody's scared for their ass. There aren't too many people ready to die for racism. They'll kill for racism but they won't die for racism.","When a system of oppression has become institutionalized it is unnecessary for individuals to be oppressive.","I approve of anyone wearing what the establishment says you must not wear.","I think we should look forward to death more than we do. Of course everybody hates to go to bed or miss anything, but dying is really the only chance we'll get to rest.","The question arises whether all lawyers are the same. This is like asking whether everything that gets into a sewer is garbage."],"Floyd Abrams":["It just seems to be a human trait to want to protect the speech of people with whom we agree. For the First Amendment, that is not good enough. So it is really important that we protect First Amendment rights of people no matter what side of the line they are on.","So sometimes the facts are good and sometimes the facts are bad, the important thing from the point of view of a principle as broad and important as freedom of speech is that the courts articulate and set forth in a very protective way what those principles are.","When I began we did not really have a lot of First Amendment law. It is really surprising to think of it this way, but a lot of the law - most of the law that relates to the First Amendment freedom of the press in America - is really within living memory.","It has something to do with the facts and the law and who the judges are. So I think lawyers sometimes exaggerate their role in winning and losing. Lawyers do have a role, and a major role, but they're not the only players in this game.","CBS fought very hard on this because it believed and believes that there's a principle at stake here. The principle is that Dan Rather doesn't work for the police, and that people that speak to Dan Rather understand that he's a journalist and not a police agent.","I would say that the Pentagon Papers case of 1971 - in which the government tried to block the The New York Times and The Washington Post that they obtained from a secret study of how we got involved in the war in Vietnam - that is probably the most important case.","My role in it was not as central as it was in some of the later cases considering I was younger then and I was playing a role of co-counsel on the case.","The government would be able to go to court with respect to newspaper articles, broadcast pieces and the like that they thought were bad or harmful or even against the government and try to block them.","It is within the last quarter century or thirty years. And a lot of that law has turned out to be very, very protective of the press and the public's right to know.","I think we have some serious problems now, but, if you look back over the last thirty or forty years that my book deals with, I think we are in better shape now than we would have been if all of those cases had not come down.","I really did try to write it so that an educated public that cares about issues like this doesn't have to be a lawyer and can read it and understand it.","It's not like learning how to hit a curve ball in baseball.","I just had the sense that at least the books that I had read about law just didn't really have enough of that.","I really try at least to come back and answer the question as to whether that was really the best way to do that and was I really thinking straight and how did my opponents behave and how did the judges behave was needed.","I am really impressed by lawyers who write books and tell us that they never lost a case. Most lawyers who have never lost a case have not had enough hard cases. But there are very difficult cases out there.","I still owe a duty of loyalty to my clients and former clients, so I cannot specify which clients I did not especially find congenial, but the cause was the same.","I think that it is important for people to understand that whether a good-guy or a bad-guy wins a case is less important than what the law is that the case results in.","There are some circumstances in which the First Amendment interest comes up against another interest that is really important and in which we have to make a decision in a particular case as to which is more important.","No other country in the world gives protection like that, but it is not absolute protection. People sometimes meet that high burden and win libel suits, and in those cases I think they ought to win.","I try to do that in this book without preaching - to try to do as you just said that you really have to defend the First Amendment rights of everybody.","CBS exhausted the Texas courts. They went from the trial court to the intermediate court to the highest court.","Here we have a situation where a defendant in a case agrees to an interview with Dan Rather. It happened to be not confidential. But it was an interview with Dan Rather.","I know a lot of reporters certainly will go to jail to defend confidential sources. Some have even gone to jail for an issue like this. But I can't say that's the norm.","I mean the idea of this is that it's a good thing for the public to hear interviews like this and that there will be an inevitable amount of fewer interviews if people that the press talks to wind up thinking, well, it's not really a CBS correspondent.","I think that the very fact that CBS fought and fought and fought in Texas, in New York.","If the word gets out, if the perception exists that by speaking to a CBS journalist you are, therefore, inevitably, immediately speaking to the police, I don't think there's any doubt but that people won't talk. And, therefore, the public won't learn.","It is not to benefit CBS, not to benefit its reporters. On this one, the entire basis of it is this is a way to get more information, more important information to the public. And that's why so many states recognize this.","The principle though remains the same, and the important thing is CBS fought hard, very hard, to protect that principle and will fight again.","The question at the end of the day was, the courts having found there was no defense, a producer about to go to jail, should CBS in effect tell the producer go to jail even though there is no law at all that we can use to get you out of jail?","This is going right to the police. So, it's a very dangerous precedent.","Were this not Texas, were there not a state where there were no protections at all and where the law was clear on that, I think CBS and Mary Mapes and Dan Rather and all of us had a very good chance of winning. So this is an ongoing battle about an issue of principle."],"Floyd Mayweather, Jr.":["A true champion will fight through anything.","You have good days, you have bad days. But the main thing is to grow mentally.","Don't ever know who you may meet, or just because a person may not be dressed up all fancy, don't mean they're not an important person. You just don't ever know who you're gonna meet in life. So that's why I look at everybody as equal. Can't just judge. I treat everybody with respect. Every man.","I'm going to always bleed the red, white, and blue. I represented the U.S. in the Olympics; I love my country. But the U.S. fans will love you on Monday; if you lose, they'll hate you on Tuesday. If you win, it will be back to loving you on Wednesday.","I'm always going to love my father.","A true champion can adapt to anything.","If you fight angry, you make a lot of mistakes, and when you fight a sharp, witty fighter like me, you can't make mistakes.","Most people should be talking about how Floyd Mayweather is a great undefeated future Hall of Famer that's his own promoter and that works extremely hard to get to where he's at. Instead, all you hear is hate and jealous remarks from critics who criticize me and, you know, most of the time, the people that criticize me can't do what I can do.","You hear certain things, negative things, all the time that aren't true, but you never hear about the positive.","Everywhere I go, I will make a good payday. But we got to choose the right opponent and the right time and the right venue.","When you're the best, you only want to surround yourself with the best.","Boxing is real easy. Life is much harder.","If you were my friend, I love you unconditionally. I like you the same way I like everyone else that's around me.","My whole outlook on life is, never judge a book by its cover.","You have to protect yourself at all times. What goes around comes around.","Mike Tyson was one of the fighters who motivated me. How? We both used to train at the Golden Gloves boxing gym. I used to see his Rolls-Royce, his diamond Rolex on, and I said, 'You know what? Those are the things that I want.'","I can get a black eye, a bloody nose. I can have a bad day in the gym. At the end of the day, I don't have a bad payday, and I don't have a bad night under the lights... I get bumps, bruises... but I don't have a bad night.","Ali was a threat because he was a voice, and the people hated Ali when he was a voice, but once Ali could no longer speak and he wasn't a voice, they loved him. Love me now. I don't want to be loved if I could barely walk or barely talk. That's not cool.","God only made one thing in this world that's perfect - and that's my boxing record.","I land a higher percentage of punches than any boxer in boxing.","I knew boxing before I knew anything else.","A lot of times, we get stuck, and we are followers. When you hear one person say, 'black lives matter,' or 'blue lives matter,' all lives matter. It's not right what is going on in this world on both sides.","I know that there's a god because I was able to survive everything that I've been through - all of the tough times - and I'm still at the top of my game.","I'm looking to expand my portfolio while I'm on top and while I'm young.","I come from a very rough background, and I'm saying that if you work hard and dedicate yourself that you can make it, too.","Self-preservation is an important thing to me.","You name him. I beat him.","Things happen for a reason, and the only thing you can do is at night time get on your knees and ask God for forgiveness for anything that you did that you didn't feel was right.","I'm not in this sport to say a guy can beat me.","When I step in the ring, I bring everything I have.","I am the best. There is nobody better than me.","I got a granite chin.","I'm always focused.","Boxing's in my genes. I come from a fighting background. My dad and both my uncles were good boxers. I'm blessed with the art of war.","Worry about going out there and making your own legacy.","When you go back and really listen to the legendary rappers, this is timeless music. Guys like Biggie, guys like Pac, timeless music.","In the end, you have to protect yourself at all times.","I've had boxing gloves on since before I could walk and been in gyms all of my life.","I can remember 1987 when I had my first amateur fight in Michigan, weighing 64lb. I was 10 years old. I was the youngest and smallest guy on my team. I can remember what I ate. There was this restaurant called Ponderosa, and my dad made me eat a steak. I was happy. It was a first round knockout. I slept with my trophy for two weeks.","If anyone has followed my career, they know that there's been a lot of obstacles and a lot of ups and down through my career. But day in and day out, and in the square circle, I went out there and always did my best.","I like fighters who come to fight.","I push myself to the limit.","Everything people say I couldn't do I've done.","I'm not here to judge Mike Tyson. I'm not here to judge nobody. I'm not here to monitor no other fighters. I respect him for what he did in the sport of boxing. He was an entertainer.","Nobody is faster than me.","Well, you've got certain obstacles that get in your way throughout your career, but you have to be a strong individual.","I like to play table tennis, spend time with my kids.","Boxing is what pays my bills.","I'm a man of my word.","My dad was in a hospital for months. The doctors told my dad he would never be able to walk again. My dad beat all the odds. He came back and was able to walk and start boxing again. He went to No. 1 in the world at welterweight to fight for the world title. But he never had his chance to fight for a world title.","Different days, I think about different victories. Ricky Hatton is one of those fights. I respect Ricky Hatton. He's a warrior. He's a hell of a warrior.","What I learned from boxing and what everyone can take in real life is to follow directions, follow order. Don't give nobody a hard time.","There's ups and downs with boxing, layoffs are part of the sport and they can either help or hurt a guy.","You can never overlook a guy.","When people see what I have now, they have no idea of where I came from and how I didn't have anything growing up.","You've got to have a villain and they'll always make me a villain. I'm used to it - it makes me work harder and it makes me fight harder.","I've set the model of showing fighters how they should conduct their business.","All the money I have, I got it legally.","I think my grandmother saw my potential first. When I was young, I told her, 'I think I should get a job.' She said, 'No, just keep boxing.'","When I was about 8 or 9, I lived in New Jersey with my mother and we were seven deep in one bedroom and sometimes we didn't have electricity.","I basically raised myself.","I'm a boxer who believes that the object of the sport is to hit and not get hit.","I'll back up anything my dad says.","When I was in the ring at the Olympics, it was my father's words that I was hearing, not the coaches'. 'I never listened to what the coaches said. I would call my father and he would give me advice from prison.","I like to control my own personal life.","I want to be promoted in the urban areas. A lot of African-American people should know more about me.","I feel like everybody is against Floyd Mayweather. I don't get any respect.","If I'm scared and I'm a coward, why do you guys want to see me fight?","Once I am in the square circle, I am in my home.","I got a big mouth.","I think I already proved that I wasn't just fighting for the money, because I fought as an amateur. I fought 90 fights for free.","You know, everybody has a slogan, and once you beat people over the head with it so much, then that's what you'll eventually be called once you retire from the sport or whatever.","A lot of times, in the beginning of my career, I put pressure on myself just because I wanted to perform so well. I just wanted to be perfect.","I don't adjust my training for any of my opponents. I don't watch films on my opponents.","I always put my boxing first.","I ain't never nervous. Never nervous.","I love basketball.","I'm a professional fighter and like most professional fighters I have had difficulties with my hands in the past.","What's so crazy is when you give interviews to reporters that don't really care too much for you, basically what they're going to do is write what they want to write and discredit you. They're going to write and say what they want to say, no matter what you tell them.","People have said things about me, and wrote and criticized me about things in the past, but it goes in one ear and out the other.","When they put me on ESPN and they talk about negative things, or when they put me on TMZ and they talk about negative things, I'm just glad that I'm relevant; to have lasted this long being relevant.","I would lie in bed, and I was nine years old, and say to myself: 'I want to be the richest man in the world.' I've come a long way from there.","You know, as a young child, I lay in my bedroom and I swore to myself then: 'I'm not going to smoke and I'm not going to drink.' And I said I'm not going to just say that when I'm a kid. I'm going to stick to that as an adult. I kept that in mind my whole life.","Some people are just right for you.","Floyd Mayweather is in the sport to give great performances.","The American fans would love to see me fight anybody.","I haven't took no punishment. There's nothing cool about taking punishment.","I loved competing and winning and also wanted to continue my career for the fans, knowing they were there for me and enjoyed watching me fight.","There comes a time when money doesn't matter.","I'm not in this sport to take punishment.","My skills are still my skills.","I don't have to fight if I don't want to.","My kids are the future of the Mayweather family and of the Mayweather brand. I feel our family is stronger if we stay together.","Racism still exists in the sport of boxing.","No one thought the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight would happen, but I had patience.","Even though I made $800 million, I am still grounded.","Barack Obama was a good president, and hopefully, Donald Trump is a good president.","Every time I go out there and compete, my number is, of course, $100 million or better.","How can a guy talk about $20 or $30 million if he's never even made $8 or $9 million?","For Conor McGregor, I'm coming out of retirement just to fight Conor McGregor.","I just want to be the best. I haven't been in an all-out war. That doesn't mean I'm not the best.","Bernard Hopkins? He fights scary dirty. I mean, he did what he had to do in his career.","I'm here to say all lives matter.","When you talking boxing, you talking me.","Larry Merchant's just a commentator. He don't know nothing about boxing.","God has blessed me with an unbelievable talent, with fast feet, fast hands, unbelievable defense and a very, very sharp mind. So I'm thankful for that.","Every home that I have is paid for, every car that I have is paid for, and I am a hundred-million-dollar man. I mean, this is the truth; it's not a lie.","You could take me anywhere. You could take me to the moon, and believe me, everybody's going to try to take a trip to the moon to watch me fight.","I knew Dana White as a good guy, a good square guy.","When no one knew who Dana White was... Dana White used to run around with me, hang out with me, and I treated him just like anyone else in my camp.","Conor McGregor is a tough competitor. He proved throughout the years in the UFC that he can fight standing up.","When they said, 'Why is Floyd Mayweather not fighting Manny Pacquiao?' it was because Manny Pacquiao had a boss. I don't have a boss.","I've never had a job. I've never needed to.","I turned pro as a 20-year-old, won a world title a year later, and remained a world champion ever since.","We talk about these legendary fighters, talk about how they had hundred-something fights, hundred-something victories... but when you look at the history books, I still beat more world champions than any fighter in history.","Mayweather Promotions - we are the past, the present, and the future of sports and entertainment, and everybody knows Mayweather's pay is better.","I commend Chris Brown and Soulja Boy for going out there for so many years and entertaining the people.","I'm not here to judge. We don't know what Trump can do.","I'm just an American dream.","I was able to retire from the sport with all my faculties and not let the sport retire me."],"Floyd Patterson":["The fighter loses more than his pride in the fight; he loses part of his future. He's a step closer to the slum he came from.","For if you train hard and responsibly your confidence surges to a maximum.","I've been knocked down more than any heavyweight champion in history.","Fear was absolutely necessary. Without it, I would have been scared to death."],"Floyd Skloot":["When memories fade, can one ever really return home?","Dementia resembles delirium in the same way an ultra-marathon resembles a dash across the street. Same basic components, vastly different scale. If you've run delirium's course once or twice in your life, try to imagine a version that never ends.","Dementia is, after all, a symptom of organic brain damage. It is a condition, a disorder of the central nervous system, brought about in my case by a viral assault on brain tissue. When the assault wiped out certain intellectual processes, it also affected emotional processes.","I've forgotten what it's like to remember. I've lost the mindless confidence that a moment, an idea, a thought will be there for me later, the bravado of breezing through experience in the certainty that it will become part of my self, part of my story.","At 93, so deep in dementia that she didn't remember any details of her life, my mother somehow still knew songs.","My wife is a painter, musician, and fiber artist. We married in 1993, and as she worked, I found that my reading about art was helping me understand what she was doing, just as seeing her work gave me a language with which to speak of art.","Neurologists have a host of clinical tests that let them observe what a brain-damaged patient can and cannot do.","A new laboratory technique, positron emission tomography, uses radioactively labeled oxygen or glucose that essentially lights up specific and different areas of the brain being activated when a person speaks words or sees words or hears words, revealing the organic location for areas of behavioral malfunction.","I used to be able to think. My brain's circuits were all connected, and I had spark, a quickness of mind that let me function well in the world.","My cerebral cortex, the gray matter that MIT neuroscientist Steven Pinker likens to 'a large sheet of two-dimensional tissue that has been wadded up to fit inside the spherical skull,' is riddled instead of whole.","I became demented overnight. Sudden onset is one factor that distinguishes my form of dementia from the more common form associated with Alzheimer's disease.","In the spring of 1993, I married Beverly and moved to the woods. This is something I could never have imagined myself doing.","Through his long, productive career, Paul Theroux has mixed nonfiction books about exotic travel with novels set in exotic places. Africa, Singapore, Hong Kong, Honduras - he lives in and writes about places most of us never see.","Music seems hard-wired into our very being. It moves us, stirs us to action, sets us in motion, sticks in our memories and minds.","Most people imagine music playing in their heads, but some hallucinate music; some cannot sleep because of the soundtrack in their mind.","Irish novelist John Banville has a creepy, introverted imagination.","In 1964, at the age of 39, Flannery O'Connor died from complications of lupus. She had lived with this autoimmune disease for 14 years, primarily confined to her mother's farm, Andalusia, in Milledgeville, Ga.","For those who turn to literary biography for salacious details, 'Flannery' will disappoint. It is the biography of someone who had very little chance to live in the conventional sense, to experience events.","Flannery O'Connor's brief life and slim output were nonetheless marked by piercing powers of observation.","When Beverly and I got together in 1992, and I moved to be with her in the little round house she'd built in the middle of 20 acres of woods near Amity, I found myself immersed in a natural setting that I responded to with all my being.","I feel that I'm a poet first. Not only was poetry the first genre in which I wrote, it's the genre that serves as the basis for my practice as a writer.","Though my poems are about evenly split between traditionally formal work that uses rhyme and meter and classical structure, and work that is freer, I feel that the music of language remains at the core of it all. Sound, rhythm, repetition, compression - these elements of my poetry are also elements of my prose.","I think one of the primary themes in my work is the paradox of memory, at once fundamental to our sense of who we are and yet elusive, ever-changing, fragmentary. One way to look at this is to say that, therefore, we ourselves are elusive, ever-changing and fragmentary to ourselves.","I'm a writer who simply can't know what I'm writing about until the writing lets me discover it. In a sense, my writing process embraces the gapped nature of my memory process, leaping across spaces that represent all I've lost and establishing fresh patterns within all that remains.","In question-and-answer sessions after a reading or during an interview, I forget the question if I'm giving too long an answer. And at the end, I can't remember any of the questions. The more anxious I am about remembering, the more likely I am to forget.","If I don't write down a thought - or an image or a line of poetry - the instant it comes to mind, it vanishes, which explains why I have pens and notebooks in my pants and coat pockets, the car, the bicycle basket, on one or two desks in every room including bathrooms and the kitchen.","In 'A Poetics of Optics,' Equi writes that 'all images bank on alchemy.' This idea captures her fundamental sense of poetry as turning common material into something rare and valuable.","Elaine Equi has been publishing her observant, often playful poetry for some 30 years, extending and deepening the range of her intrinsically wry voice.","One of the strangest aspects of living with certain kinds of memory loss is knowing that the forgetting is happening.","A risk for a poet-novelist is imbalance: The poems can flatten into prose or lose their intensity of focus; the novels can stall amid lofty writing or literary preciousness and ignore the engine of plot and character.","'The Art Student's War' is, at its core, a traditional American wartime love story. As such, it is timely and engrossing. By the end, all its principal characters 'have been to Hell and back.'","Eliza Factor's first novel, 'The Mercury Fountain,' explores what happens when a life driven by ideology confronts implacable truths of science and human nature. It also shows how leaders can inflict damage by neglecting the real needs of real people.","Fiction about mining has a long tradition - Emile Zola's 'Germinal' and Upton Sinclair's 'King Coal' come to mind - and most readers will be aware of the industry's harsh conditions.","Science trumps magical thinking: there was a reason the Incas called their mercury mine 'la mina de los muertos,' the mine of the dead. Building a life and a community upon principles that ignore such realities is doomed to fail."],"Flula Borg":["The hardest portion of English, I must say it: Idioms.","Sometimes you have to exercise your insanity, to really make it strong.","I wrote a techno song after I was deported. I was in America for a little bit, but then I was deported back to Germany. I was very sad.","I wrote a techno song about the four things I love in Germany to make myself happy, which are my grandfather, my two poodle pets, bread, and a strange but delicious Turkish dish called Doener Kebab.","I really like the Doors. I like Kevin Spacey, Bruce Springsteen, Will Farrell, Reggie Watts, Tina Turner, who is also very hot, Tracy Chapman. Beethoven.","More exposure has give to me more discipline because I am seeing that more people are wanting to observe what I am making/filming/singing; this does motivate me to make videos for every week.","I love to work with performers that are very different to me.","I do not really know what is my interview and performance style.","I am a musician who also does love to explore the world in many ways, so my approaching with my songs, videos, and haikus is: 'Make It Real.'","I am a crazy Maverick fan. I would go there if Dallas was a great entertainment center.","I think many people are finding things I do very funny and strange.","When I see things that are inspiring, I must write a song about it. Some people make a t-shirt or slap something on a wall with paint, but I must make music and freestyle rap.","I like to make my name of songs strange.","Dirk Nowitzki has been my hero for many years.","Dirk is like the German Moses, invincible and inspiring. That is why 'His Name Is Dirk' must be the Official Fan Song for Dirk Nowitzki."],"Flume":["I think Sydney has so much natural beauty; it's just a beautiful city.","Imperfection is perfection.","I did a few DJ gigs at empty clubs, sort of as a warm-up set before Flume was a thing. I did one when I got big enough, and I had five friends come down, and they were the only ones dancing. That was one of my earliest ones. I was super nervous.","I'd like to do some crazy art installations and design some weird synthesizers and work with other people and make some fun stuff for a bit. Maybe tap into virtual reality stuff or maybe write another record... We'll see.","For me, I actually come from an electronic dance music background: house music, electro house, trance music, even. When I was coming out of school, basically, I discovered Brain Fever, Flying Lotus, J Dilla and all that. That was when I got excited about hip-hop and when the Flume project started.","I've been having meetings with people, just everywhere in the world, and it's like, 'Hey, really love you to work with me, send me some ideas.' That's the crazy part.","My main inspirations come from early '90s Trance, the French electro movement round '06, then a bunch of artists like Flying Lotus, J Dilla, Moby, The Prodigy. So I'd say it's some kind of experimental electronica with a strong hip hop influence. It's chilled, but people can still get super crazy and dance to it.","I always regret leaving home if I don't get at least four or five surfs in the week before I leave. I try to be in the water as much as possible before leaving, and it's the one thing I miss massively.","'Sleepless' was the first thing that came out and really gained a lot of traction online.","I want to fuse the abrasive and the beautiful.","I had an idea when I was 18 or 19 to start tutoring people, like the way that people get tutored in saxophone or guitar, but for production. I really enjoyed it, but I don't have time for that any more.","With Spotify, I think people are discovering a lot of artists they might not discover otherwise.","I could do another tour, make a record that's very similar, do similar venues. Or I could make a different record, do different venues, and grow. It's exciting to take it to new places, but it's never been my intent to be the biggest thing in the world. That's not what my drive is. I want to make what I want to make, and make a living off it.","A lot of electronic music out there feels cold. I want to incorporate a human element.","I actually found not having a routine was inspiration.","In the dressing room, we've just made it really Zen: low lighting, lots of candles, and fresh, healthy food.","For me, one of the downfalls of electronic music is that it can feel a little soulless or robotic.","The goal was always to do something that felt human but was 100 percent electronic.","It was a difficult second record. I had moments where I couldn't write; had moments where I was writing lots. It was just a massive learning process for me.","The thing I find frustrating about rock music is, how different can you make an acoustic drum kit sound, an electric guitar and vocals? It's very stuck, whereas with electronic music, new sounds are being created.","There's a lot of creativity in the industry, but I don't necessarily think that the most creative DJs or producers are always the biggest ones. I think it would be nice to see more of an open culture to different music. I think that's happening. With Spotify, I think people are discovering a lot of artists they might not discover otherwise.","I find that if I interact more, the crowd gets way more into the music. We also have a full live show happening, and I have lighting crew that travels around with me. We've got this Infinity Prism thing, which is lots of fun. It's an optical illusion device that we carry around.","When I heard Flying Lotus, I was like, 'Wow, okay, everything can be off the grid.'","What it is now is basically I'll sit on my computer; I basically kind of play the computer as an instrument, I guess you could say. I guess I play the Mac.","Often, when I work with a vocalist, I like to focus on the melodies first.","I've grown up by the beach all my life, and I almost get anxiety if I haven't been swimming for a couple weeks or a month. It kind of builds up, so I try and get out as much as possible.","I was an avid Pokemon card collector.","I feel like the first record was really finding my feet, figuring out what music I wanted to make... Now that I've done that, I feel like I've got a much clearer idea of what I want to sound like and what I want to discover. It's exciting.","Making sounds that literally no one has ever heard before because the software and the technology's never been there, and pairing that with great songwriting, then that's what's exciting for me. That's what I wanna do.","This life and this job and this position that I'm put in, it forces you to grow up quick. I definitely got dropped in the deep end.","I definitely wanted the second record to be a much more grandiose thing. I wanted to push myself and make a big statement.","Honestly, production when you first start can be difficult to wrap your head around.","I want to make music that is completely electronic but doesn't feel it.","Along with 'Free,' where I sing quite a bit, there are additional songs on 'Skin' where you can hear my voice in the background - lots of 'oohs' and 'aahs.' But more often than not, I use my vocals to prompt other rappers and singers to feel calmer, better, bolder.","Sydney's beautiful, the weather's great, and the air's fresh and clean, but it doesn't have the scene and the amount of likeminded people. At home, things are very comfortable, but I feel like putting myself out there a bit.","I don't think I make dance music. It's not even 4/4. And it's slow.","The music I was making for people not to dance to was the one they were dancing to.","The thing I find frustrating about rock music is, how different can you make an acoustic drum kit sound, an electric guitar and vocals?","I think at first the Flume project really started out as an online thing. I used Facebook and SoundCloud, and I think we got lucky because it felt like a bit of a golden age of those social media platforms. So I managed to create quite a solid fan base online.","It's always the first 10,000 SoundCloud listens; that was definitely a big moment, seeing the online stuff grow and crowds grow.","I just want to try writing for other people 'cause it's quite exciting.","I'd like to actually work with a lot of other people, and whether it's someone who is completely unknown who I love and think is a talent, maybe I'll work with them, or, like, maybe I'll work with some of the biggest pop stars and write music for them.","I never expected to make a lot of money from music.","I get bored of music really easily, so I always try and make music that makes sense, but then it's just a little bit wrong.","I think the thing that L.A. had on Sydney is an awesome music scene, especially for what I do.","I was delivering papers when I was, like, 10 or 11, and I'd always daydream about being an artist as a full-time thing.","There's a lot of creativity in the industry, but I don't necessarily think that the most creative DJs or producers are always the biggest ones.","I've been listening to a lot of music by Arca.","I think it would be nice to see more of an open culture to different music.","Probably the No. 1 most important thing in my music is not to sound like anyone else. It is hard in this day and age.","I've never worked with huge pop acts, I mightn't like it, but it's something I've always wanted to try.","I don't think I can name any names or anything, but this is what I've wanted to do for a long time: to have Flume as my creative outlet and to work on the biggest songs in the world, like pop, and come up with the idea and send it off.","I struggled with the pressure of having the successful record after the first record. Second album syndrome. I'm living proof; it's very real.","I used to never feel pressure to be creative; it's always just been a fun thing. And then suddenly, it's my job, and people are asking, 'Where's the record?'","To me, skin is alien and kind of weird; it weirds me out. It's strange, but it's also really intimate and personal; it's living, organic. That's how I want the music to sound; I want it to feel alien and strange, but also like it's got a heartbeat, like it's got a soul, like it's not made by a robot.","I want to keep Flume kind of experimental, weird, melodic, pretty.","I like bangers and really testosterone-fueled stuff.","Once I'm in a situation where I can not do anything for three years and go off the map, I'll focus more on writing. Right now, I want to just make Flume awesome... and big.","There was this cereal, and it had a special promotion with a CD inside the box that had a really simple music-making program on it. I got it, and that opened my mind to being able to make music on a computer and seeing all the different layers.","My parents used to play me this album when I couldn't go to sleep. It was called 'Deep Forest.' I think it was a self-titled record. It's actually still one of my favorite albums of all time.","To me it's all about textures, and that's the side of music that I'm finding really exciting. I feel like it's one of the only parts of music that mankind hasn't fully discovered yet.","I just want to write another record that's as good or better than the one I've already made. That's my main goal, to follow up stronger than before.","I know how to make a record that commercial radio or Triple J will smash now... It's kind of hard to stay true and write what you would write if you didn't have that in your head. Because I know I can get way more airplay and get this much bigger... and that's what I'm trying to avoid doing. Trying to avoid the poisons of success.","I'm not into the attention thing so much.","I feel like I've got a pretty good presence online through Instagram and Facebook. I just keep it simple.","I love heavy music. I keep Flume nice and melodic, so I save the angry, testosterone-fueled heavy stuff for What So Not. I think it's a good defining thing for the two projects.","What So Not used to be a lot more dance-y, and now it's becoming a lot more melodic. Flume has always had that melodic thing, but it's starting to become a bit heavier, so it's just difficult to navigate between the two.","I'm a huge fan of Flying Lotus. I like The XX's stuff.","I wanna make weird stuff.","Every kid has a laptop; everyone can make music, so in order to stand out, I think it's important to find that sonic identity, I think my sonic identity - and mine is finding these weird sounds that may not necessarily sound that musical, and make them sound musical.","In the right context, you can make ugly sounds, different sounds feel right at home.","It's quite fun to mess with the human voice. It's quite special in the sense that the voice is the #1 instrument that we can connect with; it doesn't sound too alien. I think that's the key is to find the line between sounding human and sounding robotic. That's an area that I like to explore a lot.","I feel like I need to continuously keep evolving and moving.","I've never been a rap guy, I don't really know that much about rap music, to be honest. I like it, but I think what really happened was just my music seems to work so well with rap music.","I feel like I ask people who have been in the industry for a while a lot of questions.","I'm always really curious about, you know, 'How do you deal with success psychologically?' and all this stuff.","I struggled with the pressure of having the successful record after the first record. Second album syndrome. I'm living proof; it's very real. It was like a psychological battle to be creative. I used to never feel pressure to be creative; it's always just been a fun thing. And then suddenly it's my job, and people are asking, 'Where's the record?'","Great songwriting will never die - it's in the DNA of music - but what's new and exciting is pairing that with new sounds that technology is enabling us to make.","The minute I saw the front page of the 'Daily Telegraph' - me with my arm around the latest 'X-Factor' contestant - I realised I'd gone into a new realm.","I'm just trying to work out how to write music now, because I've never had the opportunity where my number-one priority is writing music. I don't know how my brain works yet.","I was nine, and I was shopping in a supermarket with my dad. There was this cereal, and it had a special promotion with a CD inside the box that had a really simple music-making program on it. I got it, and that opened my mind to being able to make music on a computer and seeing all the different layers.","Combining sounds that are from another universe with the classic songwriting structures never gets old for me.","Meditation is a really powerful tool I have for life now. The only reason I know about it is because I was stressing about writing and a friend taught me it. It's been useful.","There's no person I aspire to be. I'm just doing my own thing and seeing what happens - not looking to something and trying to be that.","Music is a job, but I figured out ways to get my mind into a place where I could be creative. I actually discovered meditation. It enabled me to clear my mind of all the drama and focus on the music.","Everyone can write their melodies and chords and pianos and guitars, but what hasn't been discovered yet are tones and textures, and that's very exciting. Probably the No. 1 most important thing in my music is not to sound like anyone else.","I don't mind playing my music live. It's fun. But what my real passion is is writing music.","I've never been one to want to be the center of attention and be put up on stages every night. That's just not really my personality. I'm comfortable with it now, but my real passion is being creative.","I want to be creative in as many different environments as possible, whether it's doing film scores, writing for TV ads or video games - all sorts of stuff, as long as it requires writing music.","I'm not thinking about the next record really yet. I kind of want to do a bunch of stuff with Jonathan Zawada, the guy who did the album art. I'd like to do some crazy art installations and design some weird synthesizers and work with other people and make some fun stuff for a bit. Maybe tap into virtual reality stuff or maybe write another record.","Australia is so influenced by America. It's kind of in-between the U.K. and the States.","For me, I would prefer to not have my face on the album cover. I don't mind being in the public, but it's just not really my personality, and it's not really why I'm into this. I like making art, and that's it. I don't really want to be a celebrity, seriously. I like my privacy.","I think I put a lot of special attention towards creating interesting textures and unique sounds. Music essentially boils down to two main elements: rhythm and melody. I feel tones and textures often get overlooked, so I like to take my time finding the right sounds.","I had this little Bon Iver phase a few years back; 'Flume' was one of my favourite songs.","Back in the day, I had this fluoro pink hoodie that I thought was the coolest thing ever. Left it at a party and never saw it again. Probably the best thing that could have happened.","I think, in the early years, my biggest influences would have been... Daft Punk was a huge one for me, I bought their main record when I was nine; at a young age, I was into music. The Prodigy, Gorillaz were big ones.","I'm a really heavy sleeper. When I wake up I'm a terrible morning person.","I love working with people and having them bring something to the table that I couldn't. I think one of my favourite artists to work with has been Kucka. She's Australian, too, and it's great working with her because we kind of have a very similar take on music, and we like a lot of the same stuff. We're not super-precious about ideas.","On stage, I like to dress up a bit. I'm not scared to be like a character up there.","What it is now is basically, I'll sit on my computer; I basically kind of play the computer as an instrument, I guess you could say. I guess I play the Mac. And how it works is, say - I have a program called 'Ableton Live.' And, you know, you'll open it up, and it's just blank. There's nothing there. And then you start.","I can't sing, but I'll sing over this chord progression, like, over and over, for however long it takes - sometimes it's, like, two minutes, sometimes it's 20 minutes - until I've found like a hook or something that I'm really happy with. And then, basically, it just like that's my melody, and that's where I start from.","I like pop music, and I like really weird, strange stuff. It just didn't feel like there was anyone doing both."],"Folorunsho Alakija":["I never went to a university, and I am proud to say so because I don't think I have done too badly.","I told as much of my life as I could to encourage people: to encourage others to get to where they should be, where they want to be."],"Ford Frick":["Avoid sarcasm. Don't insist on the last word.","I'd hate this to get out but I really like opera.","Keep your temper. A decision made in anger is never sound.","Take pride in your work at all times. Remember, respect for an umpire is created off the field as well as on.","Review your work. You will find, if you are honest, that 90% of the trouble is traceable to loafing.","Never charge a player and, above all, no pointing your finger or yelling.","Keep your eye on the ball.","Keep all your personalities out of your work. Forget and forgive.","Hear only the things you should hear - be deaf to others."],"Forest Whitaker":["Stereotypes do exist, but we have to walk through them.","As human beings, we all have reasons for our behavior. There may be people who have certain physiological issues that dictate why they make certain choices. On the whole, though, I think we're dictated by our structure, our past, our environment, our culture. So once you understand the patterns that shape a person, how can you not find sympathy?","There's a molecule inside of you that is connected to everything - every person, every energy, every thing. You look for it, and when you find it, then you allow it to magnify and grow and be the dominating chemistry inside of you.","In a lot of films, they're showing more complete, developed characters of diverse ethnic backgrounds. The larger concern is to be able to tastefully explore the stereotypes, and still move past them to see the core of people.","When children and youth are deprived of their right to education, their community is deprived of a sustainable future. It is all the more true with refugees.","For many child soldiers, war and violence are all they have ever known. If we don't take it upon ourselves to show them an alternative, then they're going to be soldiers forever, and they'll continue to be recruited and to participate in violence if another conflict starts five or 10 years down the road.","I think that cinema and the arts are central in our lives because we grow up and learn about the world through our exposure to stories. Parents use them as a tool to teach their children fundamental truths and values, much as adults can view them to gain exposure to cultures and individuals that they'd never be able to view in their own lives.","I am just back from South Sudan, one of the world's most fragile nations. For years, I have been moved by the kind people who maintain hope that they will live to see peace. My heart has ached for them, as they have endured pain and violence that make such hope feel out of reach.","I was a curious child. I'd debate with anyone who came to the door - people from the Islamic community... Jehovah's Witnesses... anyone.","It's important for youth, black youths particularly, to be able to fill in the blanks of themselves so they can know completely who they are, but also all the country to understand what this means: what the civil rights movement does to us as people. It is part of the journey that we must be on in order to become fully evolved human beings.","When I was a kid, the only way I saw movies was from the back seat of my family's car at the drive-in.","The Internet is part of our evolution. The mystics used to say, 'We can travel across the planet in a thought.' Now we really can. We can be connected with a million people at a time.","In some sense, when you take a child soldier out of an armed group, you've taken away the identity he or she has had for years, and you can't assume life is just going to return to normal.","Our leaders must hear us speaking on behalf of our brothers and sisters in South Sudan. If the moral duty to save lives and work toward peace is not compelling enough to drive decision-makers, we must remind them that we care and will hold them accountable.","I can play a man who's despicable. But I'll still look inside him to find a point of connection. If I can find that kernel, audiences will relate to me.","I'm an actor. And I guess I've done so many movies I've achieved some high visibility. But a star? I guess I still think of myself as kind of a worker ant.","I've been trying to understand conflict and violence ever since I was a kid. You know. There were a few things that happened even on my block - the Black Panthers used to be right around the corner from where we were.","You have to ask if the country would have been ready for Barack Obama if we hadn't been prepared by Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice. If they hadn't already been in positions of enormous power and influence - secretary of state, secretary of defence - you know what I mean?","I stay true because whatever the project is, I'm still looking for inside of that character. It's the thing that connects him to me and to everybody else. So, the search is the same. It's to unveil the truth, and that's how I stay true, because my purpose isn't altered.","The key is that I'm trying to keep growing and trying to keep learning and deepen my connection in every way, in my life, in my work. That's what I do when I look at a role.","I've had many incidents in my life of racism. I've been thrown on the ground. I've been frisked. I've been arrested so many times I couldn't tell you. I have no need to talk about it.","Until film is just as easily accessible as a pen or pencil, then it's not completely an art form. In painting, you can just pick up a piece of chalk, a stick, or whatever. In sculpture, you can get a rock. Writing, you just need a pencil and paper. Film has been a very elitist medium. It costs so much money.","I'm inspired to work with good actors, period. I want to work with the best anytime because I think they'll make me better.","My wife, Keisha, came home once, and I had these violinists playing for her, and I'd prepared dinner for her, and I write poems. She's pretty amazing, so I like to celebrate that. She's really taught me how to celebrate life; that's something I've learned.","I always try to remain aware that what affects others affects me, too.","I try to be like a forest, revitalizing and constantly growing... Kids would tease me, calling me 'Little Bush.' But... I thought being called Forest helped me find my identity.","In high school, I did some musicals, but I never took acting until college. I was studying opera, classical voice, and a speech teacher asked me to audition for this play, and I got the lead.","It is possible for a kid from east Texas, raised in south central LA and Carson, who believes in his dreams, commits himself to them with his heart, to touch them and to have them happen.","As an actor, I've always wanted to do characters that would help me find my connection with others and connect all of us together. You always want the energy of the character, the spirit of the person, to enter you. I've been doing this for 26 years and some of the things I've done are always with me.","I care about people. In the end, I think they feel it. It comes across, regardless of the character I'm portraying.","I really wasn't even sure if I should continue acting. I would like try and figure out if I could be good enough to do it. It was like 10 or 12 years into my career before I felt like maybe I can do it. It was such a different time than now.","I think I didn't know whether I wanted to keep acting deep into my career. I kept trying to see if I would be able to do it well enough to make that part of my destiny or part of what I was supposed to do.","I liked 'Star Wars' as a kid. I liked science fiction.","I always stand up for what I believe and what I want to.","I was asked if I would play President Obama in 'My Name is Khan.' I didn't feel comfortable with doing it. Partly because he was still in office, but mainly because I felt that there were other people who were better suited to doing the role.","I can't say I follow it, but I've watched 'Downton Abbey' a couple of times and loved it.","Poitier opened the doors to so many artists, not just black artists. There is a line that goes from black to Latin to Asian with regards to roles.","If there is inequality, and that equates with colour, then I'm going to deal with it.","The first time I ever went out of the country, it was to London. I was with the choir from my college, and we were touring around all these different churches. I loved it so much I tried to find a way to stay there.","May we remain connected in love. We are one.","I'd spend every summer in Longview on my grandfather's farm. It was a tiny little town divided by a river, which was the segregation line: that side white, this side black. And meanwhile, I lived in Compton - basically, another whole world sealed into 10 square blocks. It's interesting how insular an environment can be.","You try to pull away the experiences until you get to the core of humanity, and you find that light that exists in everybody. It's that light that I'm searching for in all of my work - is that connective thing, that ether that enters all of us - you know what I mean? That's a part of God.","I try to live my life in a holistic way, show that all of it intersects because I'm coming from the same place. Now, at the core of it, I'm just trying to connect and be there, so I'm trying to be there for my family, my wife, my kids, my friends.","In life, there's a ladder sometimes, and maybe at the top, there's a mirror. You take a step up, then maybe three steps down... just because you don't want to face the decloaking in the mirror.","It's a contract of connection to be in the same space and watch and listen to stories and be caught in them. When you're in a theater, your brain expands because somebody in the theater may do something or respond to something that you wouldn't have.","I submerged myself in all the information that I could find about Idi Amin. I mean, before I left Los Angeles, I was studying Kiswahili. I was working on the dialect. I was studying every documentary and tape of him that I could find - not just visual, but also audiocassettes, even in other languages when he was speaking in other dialects.","I had been playing really interesting roles before I got great roles. Little ones - 'The Crying Game' I loved working on, and then 'Bird,' 'Ghost Dog,' so many films.","It's hard for me to judge my own films as an artist sometimes. But as an artist, I did feel a fulfillment working on them, you know?","I think I've made some choices that maybe I wasn't so sure about for some reason or another. But I'm one of the lucky ones. Even when I was young, I played Bird, and that's a role people wait for their whole lifetime.","I'm always surprised when an actor goes so deeply into the truth that they shake you to your core.","My eye? It's a genetic thing. My dad had it, and now I have it. You know, I just found out that it may be correctable a little bit, because it does impair my vision. When I look up, I lose sight in this eye. I think, maybe for other people, it informs the way they see me.","Ultimately, all human beings fulfill their patterns. We're set in a certain archetype, and we fulfill that destiny.","It's all about destiny. That's why people look at the zodiac or the I Ching - because there's a certain order to life, and that order has been lived since the beginning of time. No matter what you do, you're going to live inside of it.","If I go to a reunion in east Texas, my mother's side or my father's, one out of ten is a preacher or a teacher. That's just the way it is in my family.","I think 'The Color of Money' was very instrumental in opening up other opportunities. People started to recognize me as an artist after that film. And then, after I did 'Bird,' it was more solidified.","Good science fiction is always based in contemporary truths.","I think the only consistent thing is that I like projects that explore different social themes. 'Our Family Wedding' is a comedy, but it deals with two different cultures coming together. It's also about people letting go.","To try and act like we haven't had great progress is not true. Obama didn't fail - he changed the psyche of the nation and, in some ways, the world.","It's tough when you have to be away. But I'm probably at home more than my dad was because he was working two or three jobs sometimes.","My wife is completely different from me: she's good with everyone, whereas I'm good at directed conversation when I have a purpose for it, like now. If everyone's sitting around being social, I'm not great.","On the whole, I now see my work as being an expression of my spiritual life and, because I look at it that way, I have a different centre. I go through the stress and pressure, but I think I'm lucky because I come from a different source point.","I've been fortunate, I guess: I've gotten to play a lot of very diverse roles for quite a long time. But in the beginning, I was thinking, 'I'm not gonna do certain characters. I will be willing to say no and live on a couch.' And I was really happy.","I fell through a stage once. I was doing a truly African dance, and all of a sudden, I hit the ground with my foot and went straight through the stage. I guess they didn't have much money, so the floor was kind of rotting.","It's abhorrent to me that somebody is just evil, and you can't explain it.","I'm fascinated by the capacity to be able to do harm. I struggle every day with the ability of people to do evil. Not just the big things - the petty things that people do in order to make someone feel small, when it's so easy to do, and it hurts so much.","College football, acting, opera singing - I approached them all in the same obsessive way.","I put down the camera long ago, you know? I was here in London, aged 19, and I was obsessed with my camera, shooting everything I could. Then someone stole it. It helped me to see things for the first time.","I'd been reading Eastern philosophy since I was a kid. And I meditated. I did it on a daily basis. It's the one thing I do with any consistency. Meditation gives you a different kind of mindset. It's very powerful.","I love to play chess. The last time I was playing, I started to really see the board. I don't mean just seeing a few moves ahead - something else. My game started getting better. It's the patterns. The patterns are universal.","Fame allows you a lot of opportunities to experience new things and connect with people. But on the other hand, people's perceptions of you can limit the scope of your relationships with them. You walk both lines.","I want a director who can let me feel that he's listening and watching and that he's got me covered. That security is really important for me because sometimes you go into a vulnerable space, and you want to be able to look to somebody because you get insecure: 'Did I do that right?'","Look - I'm an African-American. I'm black. But I'm just looking at the character and trying to find his soul, his energy. If you can wipe away the blanket of skin and flesh that people tend to see, and look inside for the essence of the soul, then that's the work I'm doing. That's the work I always do.","I want to get better as an actor, to keep trying to work harder, trying to discover something different. In some ways, it's a pretty frightening experience. But normally, I do tend to walk against fear and hope that I'll be able to survive.","We're supposed to be an example of freedom, and if we are doing things that are injustice to people, then what is our statement?","I go back and forth between indie and studio because I feel like it, not because I feel obligated to do one or the other.","Directing is more comfortable for me because, as an actor, there's always something inherently false. Because I'm not that person.","It rests in the hands of the common person as well as those with the power to shape humanity's course toward a world where every child, woman and man's most basic needs are met.","While it's easy for South Sudan to feel distant, the situation is all too real for the South Sudanese mothers choosing which child gets to eat tomorrow. This is a time when we must look outward together and declare that humanity has no borders - no one deserves to suffer like this, especially in a world of such abundance."],"Forrest Bird":["My daddy was a World War I pilot, and I just wanted to be able to fly like he did.","I work as if I were going to be the next person to need a respirator. I share in the benefits I bestow on others, and my work has enriched my life.","In the human lung, there are millions of air foils, just like aeroplane wings, which facilitate normal breathing."],"Forrest Mars, Jr.":["I'm a religious man. I pray for Milky Way.","If you make a really good product that people want and are willing to pay for, money will come."],"Fortune Feimster":["I worked with the Groundlings, doing sketch comedy and improv at a theater here in L.A. It was my hobby, but I took classes and stayed passionate about it because it's what I wanted to do. It just fit. It takes a while before you can actually make money at it. I worked for years.","I do comedy at a lot of colleges, and at the end of those shows, I take time to be a little more real with audiences. I try to inspire them to follow their dreams. When I was that age, it was incredible to hear stuff like that.","I'm from a small town in North Carolina and went to a small college and didn't think that someone like me could make a living in L.A. doing comedy. I worked hard, especially in college, but at that age, you don't know what's next.","I would say my career is in a very good place. I'm in a place of a lot of hope for what's next. I see something great, but I'm not quite there.","My Southern heritage is a big part of who I am. I grew up around people who seemed like characters but are actual, real people. My grandmother made sure I had manners and all that stuff.","People know who I am or are fans of 'Chelsea Lately,' and that makes my shows more fun. People know I'm silly and are on board with what I'm bringing to the table. I see the boyfriends who got dragged to the show by their girlfriends, and by the end, they're laughing harder than anybody. That's the best feeling: 'I knew I was going to get you.'"],"Foster Friess":["If we really want to cherish religious freedom, people who want to believe that same-sex marriage should take place, they have a right to believe that, and people who want to believe it's inappropriate, we should not demonize those people - if we really believe in religious liberty.","The collusion of big business, big labor, and big government threaten the spirit of small business that makes America great.","I've said before, the number one thing that we have to work on is protecting the gay community from sharia law. Now, in the United States, it's probably not a big issue right now, but my brother-in-law is gay, and his partner and I would like them to be able to travel any place in the world without them risking harm.","You don't want to put all your lead on the target. You want to leave some arrows in the quiver.","The United Nations Children's Fund reports that more than 18 million children worldwide have lost both parents to the ravages of AIDS, starvation, war or natural disasters.","'Hannity' had a a guy on that said, 'I fathered 20 kids by 14 mothers.' That is s cultural issue which has demeaned our society and has caused our society dearly in terms of imprisonment. Who's going to be the fathers to those children? Who's going to pay child support?","I'm not a big fan of the high-altitude approach of mega TV ads.","I think of all the guys that strap a gun on their backs and head to Afghanistan and Iraq to keep us free and safe and maintain what America has stood for.","I think culture precedes politics, and I think the attempts to try and legislate people's behavior... isn't going to be productive until the culture decides what they want to achieve.","I think it's unfair that people can't give assets to whoever they want. When I die, my assets can go to my wife. And a gay person - you ought to have a system where maybe you can just say, 'You can give your assets to anybody you want.'","I'm not the hands-on guy. I like writing the check, and I turn it over to the guys that make it happen, much like the way I ran my business.","People asked, 'So what are you - a multimillionaire?' I like to say, 'A billionaire wanna-be.'","All of us grow.","If we don't change our culture, the politics is going to migrate more and more to statism.","What people love about Santorum is he is who is he. He speaks his words. He loves God. He loves his country, and he loves gays.","It's so sad to see how few people in the Obama administration have any private sector experience.","President Obama's over in Indonesia when guys like me were at a paper route. President Obama, I don't know what experience he had at that same age when he was in Indonesia. So I think it's hard for him to grasp that America entrepreneurial spirit.","I allowed Rick Santorum to express views and ideas that the American people never would have had expressed.","On the national security front, Rick Santorum is superior to any candidate I know.","Whether it is a super PAC or not, I have been blessed with wealth, and I think I have responsibility to use it properly.","I very, very much want to be involved in helping those senators, congressmen, and women who support the principles that made America great.","I have four kids. They are two years apart, and contraception has been very, very good to me.","Rick Santorum has so much potential and so much eagerness to serve our country.","In America, we have this bell curve of certain values. And then we have another bell curve of different values, which is the Republican Party. And they're out of sync right now.","In certain states, if a woman makes $12,000 a year, and lives with her quarter-of-a million dollar boyfriend and they don't get married, as long as they don't get married, she gets maybe 20 or 30 thousand dollars in pre-tax benefits in terms of food stamps, health care and housing allowance.","Santorum is the greatest person on the face of the planet as far as I'm concerned.","The press called me a billionaire, and my wife came up and said I must be squirreling money away.","I have no control over the super PAC; all I do is write the check.","I love Romney. It is not his fault that he is the son of a successful governor and makes $20 million a year.","Rick Santorum is the grandson of a coal miner. His dad was the manager of a V.A. hospital.","If you look at Republicans, they always run these old war horses.","Do you honestly think that if Senator Santorum becomes president, we're going to get rid of contraceptives?","I am absolutely stunned how the Democrats were able to somehow say that the Republicans had a war on women... What was the war on women?","I want to make sure the people we elect to office believe in America.","How hard have those intolerant of John Adams's perspective worked to strip from young people any hope of knowing the concepts and truths that help deal with life?","I think we should be encouraged to learn from Columbine and let it be a battle cry for all of us.","There's a group of people - maybe the secular Taliban is a good name for them - who have morphed this idea, that you have to accept my values being every bit as cherished as your values. That's not tolerance... There are too many things in this world which we sit back and tolerate.","I did one of those 'born again' things and invited Jesus to become the chairman of the board, of my life.","We don't have a war on terror - that's a technique. We didn't have a war on blitzkriegs, and we didn't have a war on surprise attacks.","Do we really want Washington administrators coming between us and our doctors?","You might not be able to control your circumstances, but you can control your response to your circumstances.","I think the thing I'd like to do is just educate the people to some of the travesties they can end.","The McCain-Feingold limit on how much you give a candidate didn't really work because people found ways to get around it.","In the old days, money controlled politics. Today, information controls politics. So I think with the advent of the Internet, the power of wealth has been diminished. Look up all the people you know who spent millions and millions of dollars and fell short.","Life is just so much fun and so filled with humor.","What do wealthy people do with their money? They can only buy so many cars, houses, and steak dinners. So we either give it away or invest it.","Success should stem from entrepreneurial creativity, not political connectivity.","What the 'supposed 99 percent' don't realize is that they are better off if there are more fat cats, not less.","Go to Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, or any college and you'll see libraries, dormitories, and a lot of buildings that were a result of the generosity of fat cats.","Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs did not start out wealthy, and actually added to income inequality, but we all benefit from their creative effort.","Wealth is the ultimate panacea to poverty.","It can be tough to find areas where Left and Right can agree. Consider the well-being of children: Americans often disagree about how to raise kids, how to educate them, even what to feed them.","Every child should at least grow up in family rather than without one.","Would-be adoptive parents have to struggle for years through a bureaucratic obstacle course at an average cost of $30,000."],"Foxy Brown":["My purpose is far greater than my pain.","I'm not at every party; I'm not seen everywhere. That's why people still care about my brand.","To find a prince, you gotta kiss some toads.","I'm cut from a different cloth. I would never moon someone. I was raised in a good family.","I'm a child of the Women's Movement. I always believed that I could do anything. That women didn't have to be limited in any way.","The only crime I'm guilty of is being a young black woman.","The Foxy character and Inga Marchand are two different people. My fiance calls me Inga. No one around me calls me Foxy. I go to church every Sunday. I go to Bible study every Friday night. I'm saved.","Put out great music, and that's that.","I am racing to the studio the moment that God affords me the opportunity to hear again.","It feels so good to tell the truth.","I did almost a year in prison, a year in prison, just because my name is Foxy Brown.","My family never missed a visit in eight months, ever. I cried coming out. I didn't cry coming in. There's a big difference. I believe that God put me there for a reason, Incarceration is serious.","I've never stabbed, hurt, killed, stolen, anything, but I went to jail for a year. What is that? My pastor said to me the fact that I'm not living under a bridge as a crazy woman, talking to myself, is amazing.","I love Harlem, it's like a second home to me.","Being in jail, it's humbled me in a way I never imagined.","I devoted my career to building an affinity with my fans who have supported me unflinchingly and no barbed wire fence or prison wall will stop that.","I was falsely arrested twice, slandered and defamed.","I'm willing to do whatever I need to do to change.","My life needed to be saved. Not just Foxy. That's my character. That's my work.

And leave the same way.","It was a small provincial place with great people and I had a happy childhood growing up in Queens.","Life is precious and there's not a lot of room for anger.","I have been dairy free for several years, and I started because I felt it was going to reduce my allergies, which it did, and help me lose weight, which it did.","If we don't empower ourselves with knowledge, then we're gonna be led down a garden path.","Since my illness, I've felt the presence of my angels.","I've lived, laughed, lost, and loved again the whole Shakespearian thing.","Being famous gets me good concert tickets, good tables in restaurants, good seats at sporting events and that's really about it.","I'm very involved in the writing on every level.","Every time you go to the doctor and get a good report, the odds keep staking more in your favour.","I've lived three lifetimes in my short time.","I told her I wanted a plastic surgeon to sew me up, and I wanted her to freeze my ovaries, so I could harvest the eggs and have a biological child through a surrogate.","I had my moments when I got very frightened that I would not recover.","You know I think that going into therapy is a very positive thing, and talking about it is really helpful, because the more you talk the more your fears fade, because you get it out.","Though I'm not religious in the classical sense I did partake in Passover.","Well, every time I get ready to do a job I want to lose weight.","I started as a teenager going up on commercials.","I did a terrible television pilot that was so badly written and dumb that it became a turning point for me and I decided that I would never accept a job just because I needed the money.","I like to cook, walk on the beach, go to concerts and look at fine art.","I have very eclectic taste in music, but when it comes to going to concerts, I like going to rock concerts.","I like writing better. Because I don't have to wear makeup, I don't have to be thin, and I don't have to remember lines.","I was popular. I wasn't the most popular. But I definitely held my own.","I choose the places I go to carefully and wisely. I'll rarely go to a shopping mall anymore.","I don't go to places where I'm going to get mobbed.","My clothes are predominately black and my home is predominantly white.","Well I could have been just a writer. I had been a hair dresser. I could have stuck with that.","And remember, it's also very funny, because side by side with grief lies joy.","People lived in the same apartments for years. You'd meet a group of kids in kindergarten, and you'd still be with them in high school. No one ever left the neighborhood."],"Fran Kranz":["I mean, horror films in general put humans in these awful supernatural or horrible situations, but 'Cabin In The Woods' cranks it up a few notches and becomes outrageous and totally bizarre.","Horror is so often a 'thinkless' genre, sort of considered popcorn movies, but you really put a lot of, not just heart and soul, but a lot of physical energy into it.","That's what I love about acting, is playing different roles. I want to work for the character, and not make it work for me.","When I was a kid, I would make these incredibly bloody movies in my back yard. I was constantly making weird blood concoctions; Jell-O and milk was a good one. I was constantly ruining clothes and staining my parents' walls and stuff.","It's a rare thing when you read a role and have this immediate ownership over it, you have this take and this connection, and it's not even that you feel that you're gonna do a good job, it's that you feel like you've found it. It fits, it's natural; it's like putting on a good shoe or something.","I know that I've played a lot of comedic roles. It's a visual medium. When you get one role, you start to get cast in that role for awhile because that's what people have seen you do, and have hopefully seen you do it successfully.","The actors I respect are the real character actors, who are the real chameleon actors that completely change from role to role. I love Peter Sellers, Alec Guinness and Gary Oldman. They tend to be British, I guess. People who really disappear and transform, I really like that.","I wanted to be an actor from a young age, but actually becoming one and seen the ugly side of the world does feel different and sometimes unwelcome. There are shallow, vapid, untalented people zombieing the streets of Hollywood, adding decadence and immorality to an already extravagant business.","As a professional actor, I don't have much choice about what I've gotten into. I tend to be cast in comedies and I'm fine with that.","There are actors who aren't on the cover of magazines but still decide what work they want and when they want it. I want a family one day. So I dream of really being able to decide when to work and when not to.","I'm not the biggest comic book fan."],"Fran Lebowitz":["You're only as good as your last haircut.","The opposite of talking isn't listening. The opposite of talking is waiting.","Romantic love is mental illness. But it's a pleasurable one. It's a drug. It distorts reality, and that's the point of it. It would be impossible to fall in love with someone that you really saw.","My favorite animal is steak.","In real life, I assure you, there is no such thing as algebra.","Polite conversation is rarely either.","You can't go around hoping that most people have sterling moral characters. The most you can hope for is that people will pretend that they do.","Life is something to do when you can't get to sleep.","In the Soviet Union, capitalism triumphed over communism. In this country, capitalism triumphed over democracy.","I figure you have the same chance of winning the lottery whether you play or not.","My desire to curtail undue freedom of speech extends only to such public areas as restaurants, airports, streets, hotel lobbies, parks, and department stores. Verbal exchanges between consenting adults in private are as of little interest to me as they probably are to them.","Great people talk about ideas, average people talk about things, and small people talk about wine.","Very few people possess true artistic ability. It is therefore both unseemly and unproductive to irritate the situation by making an effort. If you have a burning, restless urge to write or paint, simply eat something sweet and the feeling will pass.","I place a high moral value on the way people behave. I find it repellent to have a lot, and to behave with anything other than courtesy in the old sense of the word - politeness of the heart, a gentleness of the spirit.","Vegetables are interesting but lack a sense of purpose when unaccompanied by a good cut of meat.","Food is an important part of a balanced diet.","To put it rather bluntly, I am not the type who wants to go back to the land; I am the type who wants to go back to the hotel.","I've done the calculation and your chances of winning the lottery are identical whether you play or not.","No animal should ever jump up on the dining-room furniture unless absolutely certain that he can hold his own in the conversation.","If you are of the opinion that the contemplation of suicide is sufficient evidence of a poetic nature, do not forget that actions speak louder than words.","Do not, on a rainy day, ask your child what he feels like doing, because I assure you that what he feels like doing, you won't feel like watching.","Nature is by and large to be found out of doors, a location where, it cannot be argued, there are never enough comfortable chairs.","Being a woman is of special interest only to aspiring male transsexuals. To actual women, it is simply a good excuse not to play football.","Humility is no substitute for a good personality.","Contrary to popular opinion, the hustle is not a new dance step - it is an old business procedure.","I never took hallucinogenic drugs because I never wanted my consciousness expanded one unnecessary iota.","I must take issue with the term 'a mere child', for it has been my invariable experience that the company of a mere child is infinitely preferable to that of a mere adult.","There is no such thing as inner peace. There is only nervousness or death. Any attempt to prove otherwise constitutes unacceptable behavior.","Andy Warhol made fame more famous.","Your life story would not make a good book.

This is due to the fact that while the news is being broadcast, the disk jockey is not allowed to talk.","Don't bother discussing sex with small children. They rarely have anything to add.","Children are the most desirable opponents at scrabble as they are both easy to beat and fun to cheat.","I never met anyone who didn't have a very smart child. What happens to these children, you wonder, when they reach adulthood?","If you are truly serious abut preparing your child for the future, don't teach him to subtract teach him to deduct.","All God's children are not beautiful.

How can you learn something if you never see it, read it, or hear it?","The New York Times Bestseller 'The Amateur,' written by Ed Klein, former editor of the 'New York Times Magazine,' is one of the best books I've read.","You know, quarterbacks, I think greatness in quarterbacks is taking what you've got, whether it's a great team, a good team, or a struggling team and make them better.","What's so wonderful about football and business and show business is that every time I start thinking I'm special, I get knocked on my ass.","The pro athlete is a sad tale. He signs a big contract and thinks he's set for life. I didn't think I was set for life, and I don't now. As athletes, we are important, celebrities, in demand and rich. Then we are out of the game and we are not important, not celebrities, not in demand and not rich.","Television isn't my career. Business is.","In sports, teams win and individuals don't.","Quarterbacks need to make their team better.

I came out of the womb, and people wanted to know who I was because of my parents.","We've moved so much, and my life has been so inconsistent.","I'm really lucky, because I've been able to go places and meet people you can only dream of.","It's creepy to see fan sites about me.","So I have been careful about where I go and who I hang out with because if you tell someone the wrong thing, then it's everywhere.","I can count on one hand how many people I trust.","These people are fascinated by me, but I haven't done anything.","If you're a big Nirvana fan, a big Hole fan, then I understand why you would want to get to know me, but I'm not my parents."],"Frances Beinecke":["Pollution from human activities is changing the Earth's climate. We see the damage that a disrupted climate can do: on our coasts, our farms, forests, mountains, and cities. Those impacts will grow more severe unless we start reducing global warming pollution now.","Wind and other clean, renewable energy will help end our reliance on fossil fuels and combat the severe threat that climate change poses to humans and wildlife alike.","The single most important thing we can do to protect our communities from climate change is to reduce dangerous carbon pollution.","Opening up Atlantic and Arctic waters to drilling would lock the next generation into burning oil and gas in a way that only makes climate change that much worse, fueling ever rising seas, widening deserts, withering drought, blistering heat, raging storms, wildfires, floods and other hallmarks of climate chaos.","We can choose food that doesn't lead to illnesses like diabetes and cancer. We can choose food that doesn't contribute to water pollution and climate change. And we can choose food that keeps local economies vibrant and farmers on their land.","Carbon pollution contributes to climate change, which causes temperatures to rise. Hotter temperatures mean more smog in the air, and breathing smog can inflame deep lung tissue. Repeated inflammation over time can permanently scar lung tissue, even in low concentrations.","I have long understood that climate change is not only an environmental issue - it is a humanitarian, economic, health, and justice issue as well.","Whether it is salt farmers in India embracing solar power or wind companies creating tens of thousands of jobs in America, people are providing a vision for the clean energy future.","The people who harvest America's food must be treated with respect and earn a living wage.","Pollution from oil and gas development, toxic runoff, and miles and miles of plastic trash foul the waters and threaten marine life.","The science tells us that if we fail to reduce global warming pollution, global temperatures will rise to dangerous levels and unleash devastating extreme weather events and accelerate destructive sea level rise.","I was in college when tens of thousands of people marched on Washington for the first Earth Day. Raw sewage floated in rivers and clouds of smog hung over cities. But then something amazing happened. People spoke out. Thousands of students, workers, and ordinary citizens used their voices to say, 'This has to change.'","Nearly every president in the past 100 years has declared national monuments, from Teddy Roosevelt creating the Grand Canyon National Monument to George W. Bush preserving 10 islands and 140,000 square miles of ocean waters in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.","The phrase 'mad as a hatter' was coined because hat makers were poisoned by the high levels of mercury used in felt processing; these workers developed a strange, uneven gait as well as strange alterations in their personalities - traits that resembled mental instability.","The fossil fuel industry commands outsize sway over U.S. politics, markets, and democracy. I knew these companies were formidable, but when I served on the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling, I got a close up view of how the industry disregards government safeguards.","When we go to the store, we bring home more than food - we bring home traces of broader environmental problems. But we can use our shopping carts and dinner plates to help solve some of those problems.","Our nation has abundant clean energy resources, and tapping them will generate jobs, make the air safer to breathe, and tackle climate change - the greatest environmental crisis of our time.","Countries have made impressive pledges to cut carbon pollution, but we have to ensure these promises become actions.","Putting a tax on carbon could be an effective approach for curbing global warming pollution.","Striking a balance between wildlife conservation and wind energy development starts with understanding threats to eagle populations and how our actions, including operating wind farms, are affecting them.","Tar sands oil is the dirtiest fuel on Earth. Because producing it consumes so much energy, a gallon of tar sands crude generates 17 percent more carbon pollution than conventional crude oil.","Shell has poured billions of dollars into offshore Arctic drilling, but no matter how much it spends, it cannot make the effort anything but a terrifying gamble. And if Shell, the most profitable company on Earth, can't buy its way to safety in Alaska, nobody can.","The San Gabriel Mountains rise like a rampart at the edge of the city, safeguarding more than 500,000 acres of mature forests, mountain streams, dramatic waterfalls, and towering peaks that reach over 9,000 feet. These untamed places attract bighorn sheep, mountain lions, and other threatened or endangered species.","The San Gabriel monument expands our natural heritage, but there is more in need of safeguarding - extraordinary places like Utah's Greater Canyonlands.","Under pressure from a growing movement of people who want their money out of fossil fuels, universities, pension investors and foundations are looking to exclude coal, oil and gas stocks from their portfolios.","Water efficiency, recycling, and other local supplies will help California flourish in a drier future.","Protecting eagles from the threat of extinction is a conservation success story that we must prudently safeguard for future generations to come.","Once a landscape is industrialized, its wild character is lost for good. You can't recreate untouched tundra, mountain meadows, crystal clear streams, and animals that have never encountered toxic waste.","Climate change deniers would have us believe that oil, gas, and coal are the only ways to power a modern, industrialized society. They are wrong, and the proof is all around us.","The Keystone XL pipeline is a threat to our nation. It would increase pollution and intensify climate change for generations to come. We must raise our voices and demand our leaders reject this dirty scheme.","Healthy forests and wetlands stand sentry against the dangers of climate change, absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and locking it away in plants, root systems and soil.","The San Gabriel Valley, stretching from Pasadena to Pomona, is especially starved for open space. The valley has a rich array of ethnically diverse communities, but it also has some of the highest rates of childhood obesity and diabetes in the state.","Mercury is most commonly recognized as a developmental toxin, threatening to young children and fetuses as they develop their nervous system. Prenatal exposure to even low levels of mercury can cause life-long problems with language skills, fine motor function, and the ability to pay attention.","Americans are worried about pollution - oil trains running through their towns, fracking in their neighborhoods, coal dust in their air. They're worried about what the future will look like for their children if carbon pollution continues unchecked.","Studies show that women are more likely than men to die in natural disasters. Women's voices must be heard.","I attended the climate talks in Copenhagen in 2009, and back then, national governments waited until days before to submit climate plans, and the U.S. based its pledge on a proposed bill that would fail in the Senate.","Though every nation must do its part to address climate change, developed nations are responsible for the lion's share of carbon pollution in the atmosphere, and they have an obligation to help developing nations transition to a sustainable future.","We look back at the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments, where people screamed and hollered it's going to be too expensive, they couldn't afford it, and it wouldn't work. And it worked. It worked faster than people expected, at much less cost.","A cap on carbon is important because it sets a specific goal for reducing carbon emissions 80% by 2050.","I do believe that the coal industry sees the cultural shift toward cleaner energy and global warming solutions as a threat to their interests.","In the end, the market will decide which is the better performer: dirty coal-fired power or clean wind and solar. Market-based competition. That doesn't sound like communism to me.","As heat rises, so does the number of people trying to cool down homes, schools, hospitals and businesses. This isn't just about comfort; it's a matter of public health.","Too often, the air conditioners we use to cool down also contribute to climate change - the very force that's fueling extreme heat.","Safer chemicals and more energy-efficient technologies can provide cooling without severe climate implications. Shifting to these alternatives could avoid the equivalent of 12 times the current annual carbon pollution of the United States by 2050.","Shell Oil's decision to pull the plug on drilling for oil in the Chukchi Sea is a major victory for the Arctic.","Many environmental battles are won by delaying a destructive project long enough to change the conversation - to allow new economic, political and social dynamics to emerge.","VW has held a beloved place in American culture. When I graduated from college, many of my friends drove across the country, and most hit the road in a VW van or Bug. Through the years, these cars have represented youth, freedom and quirkiness.","Though many corporations honor commitments to reduce dangerous pollution, some cut corners and cheat. The marketplace doesn't always have mechanisms to correct bad actors.","I have been fighting climate change for two decades, and people often ask me how I remain hopeful in the face of extreme weather and grim forecasts. The answer is simple: I see countless solutions spreading across the nation and across the world. But we need more investment.","When climate change supercharges weather patterns, the disadvantaged often suffer first and most.","Instead of going to the ends of the Earth - and plumbing the depths of the oceans - to squeeze out every last drop of oil, we need, instead, to do everything we can to reduce the risks of offshore oil and gas production.","Business leaders, social justice groups, farmers and ranchers, doctors and nurses and people from all walks of life are concerned about the climate threat.","I have visited people whose health has been endangered by tar sands oil. I have watched neighbors struggle to recover from Superstorm Sandy. I have seen solar panels and wind turbines become an increasingly familiar part of the landscape.","Strong limits on carbon pollution will save Americans money, create jobs, improve our health, and help defuse climate change.","From reinforcing beaches in the Rockaways to installing generators at the Coney Island Houses and sealing holes in the subway system, New York is fortifying our ability to withstand future storm surges.","Green roofs, roadside plantings, porous pavement, and sidewalk gardens have been proven to reduce flooding. They absorb rainwater before it swamps the streets and sewage systems.","New York and Connecticut belong to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative to cut carbon emissions, and New York City has been a leader in energy efficiency.","We'll always need energy. We need to communicate, too, but we're not stuck with hand gestures and smoke signals. There are better ways to power our future than by digging fossil fuel from the ground and setting it on fire.","Mangroves, salt marshes and sea grass lock away carbon at up to five times the rate of tropical forests.","The U.S. can become carbon neutral in our lifetimes. In the process, we will put millions of Americans to work, make our companies more competitive, and shield our communities from extreme weather. And we will honor our obligation to leave the world a better place for future generations.","Los Angeles County is one of the most park-poor urban areas in the nation, and the San Gabriel Valley - stretching from Pasadena to Pomona - is especially starved for open space.","Declaring the San Gabriel Mountains a national monument will make this natural wonder more accessible. It will welcome people from all walks of life and maintain the mountains' wild character at the same time.","The signs of climate change are visible across the nation, from the drought-stricken fields of Central California to the flooded streets of Michigan. Extreme weather is turning people's lives upside down and costing communities millions of dollars in damaged infrastructure and added health care costs.","NRDC has helped bring hope spots to more of our shared ocean waters. We helped draft and pass a California law creating a network of underwater parks stretching from the Oregon border to the Mexican border.","The oceans produce up to 70 percent of our oxygen, they shape our climate, and they support an American oceans economy larger than our nation's entire agriculture sector.","Back when the EPA proposed phasing out ozone-depleting CFCs, the chemical industry howled that refrigerators would fail in America's supermarkets, hospitals and schools.","Getting toxic lead out of gasoline, the oil industry shouted, would cost a dollar a gallon. It turned out to cost just a penny a gallon to protect hundreds of thousands of kids from lead-induced brain damage.","The Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument may be distant from our shores, but it will help us understand how healthy marine ecosystems work and how we can revive troubled seas closer to home.","Americans welcome carbon limits because they want to protect their families from harm.","The U.S. limits mercury, arsenic, and soot from power plants. Yet, astonishingly, there are no national limits on how much carbon pollution these plants can dump into our atmosphere.","The U.S. has a proud history of cleaning up our air through technological innovation. We did it with leaded gas, acid rain and countless other pollutants, and we can do it with carbon pollution, too.","When I left school, I never wondered whether my apartment in New York was vulnerable to storm surges, but my three daughters have to consider the realities of extreme weather and how it may destabilize communities around the globe.","Young people are already leading on climate action. I see it at rallies to reject the Keystone XL dirty tar sands pipeline. I see it in the push to demand justice for communities being run over by fracking operations.","For decades, NRDC has created and supported policies that will ultimately end our reliance on fossil fuels.","A stock market index helps investors track the performance of a group of stocks. NRDC worked with FTSE to develop comprehensive and transparent methodologies that screen out companies linked to owning, exploring, or extracting fossil fuels.","I have talked to people across the country struggling in the face of an altered climate. New Jersey homeowners are trying to rebuild after Superstorm Sandy. Miami government officials are trying to plan for rising seas and flooded streets. California farmers are trying to make it through the state's worst drought on record.","The truth is you can't get more water from reservoirs that are empty.","California's drought affects everyone in the state, from farmers to fishermen, business owners to suburban residents, and everyone has a role to play in using precious water resources as wisely and efficiently as possible.","The more people learn about the proposed Keystone XL tar sands pipeline, the worse it looks.","Instead of hazarding our future on the dirty fuels of the past, let's invest in clean power that can drive this country forward. Let's cut energy waste, make our economy the world's most efficient, and give our workers a leg up in the global marketplace.","All Americans have benefited from the dedicated service of Representative Henry Waxman. In every battle and in every moment that mattered most, Rep. Waxman stood up for the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the wild places we cherish.","After being nearly eradicated from the lower 48 states by the 1960s, bald eagles were re-introduced to the Adirondacks in the 1980s, and I'm proud to report the view from my home indicates they are flourishing in upstate New York.","Climate change is the central environmental ill of our time. We have an obligation to protect our children from the dangers of this widening scourge, and we aren't yet doing enough about it.","When the government undertakes or approves a major project such as a dam or highway project, it must make sure the project's impacts, environmental and otherwise, are considered. In many cases, NEPA gives the public its only opportunity to be heard about the project's impact on their community.","NEPA's common sense approach to foster discussion and collaboration about major development projects has worked well to protect our national treasures and resources.","Every year, tens of millions of salmon return to the pristine shores of Bristol Bay in Alaska. They linger in the bay's cool, shallow waters before charging up nearby streams to spawn and create another generation of wild salmon.","We must not sacrifice one of our remaining untamed places in reckless pursuit of oil. We know we have to leave oil in the ground, or destructive climate change will become unstoppable. If not in the pristine and vulnerable Arctic Ocean, then where?","We can power our economy without despoiling our wild places.","Mercury is a potent toxin that interferes with the human nervous system. Reducing this hazard will be a major public health breakthrough.","In grownups, mercury can cause memory loss, tremors, vision loss and numbness of the fingers and toes. It can also adversely affect fertility and blood pressure regulation, and a growing body of evidence suggests that exposure to mercury may lead to heart disease.","Americans are already paying the price for record heat waves, dirty air, and an unstable climate. We need to fight these threats with every weapon we have, and the electricity industry has to do its fair share.","When people who love the ocean come together, they can achieve extraordinary things.","The oceans have been a part of my life for as long as I remember. As a child, I spent hours playing in the surf off Cape Cod. In college, I fished along the rocky coast of Nova Scotia with my school's fishing team.","At the start of my career, I fought to prevent offshore drilling along the Atlantic Coast.","Over the years, I have seen the power of the oceans to excite, feed, and sustain people. I have also seen them undergo a growing onslaught of attacks, from destructive fishing practices to rising acidification."],"Frances Burney":["People who live together naturally catch the looks and air of one another and without having one feature alike, they contract a something in the whole countenance which strikes one as a resemblance.","A youthful mind is seldom totally free from ambition; to curb that, is the first step to contentment, since to diminish expectation is to increase enjoyment.","To whom, then, must I dedicate my wonderful, surprising and interesting adventures? to whom dare I reveal my private opinion of my nearest relations? the secret thoughts of my dearest friends? my own hopes, fears, reflections and dislikes? Nobody!","I cannot be much pleased without an appearance of truth; at least of possibility I wish the history to be natural though the sentiments are refined; and the characters to be probable, though their behaviour is excelling.","There is something in age that ever, even in its own despite, must be venerable, must create respect and to have it ill treated, is to me worse, more cruel and wicked than anything on earth.","The mind is but too naturally prone to pleasure, but too easily yielded to dissipation.","Insensibility, of all kinds, and on all occasions, most moves my imperial displeasure.","We continually say things to support an opinion, which we have given, that in reality we don't above half mean."],"Frances Conroy":["If you choose to be Frankenstein with Botox and plastic surgery, you've bought your own private mask.","It's like real life: We don't get a preview of what's coming up, thank God, and we don't build our own character from what we're going to be informed with in the future.","As you age naturally, your family shows more and more on your face. If you deny that, you deny your heritage.","I can't form a total picture of things. Because I'm not her.","Marriage is an exercise in torture.","Some people ask me, Do they put aging makeup on you? It's just this very nice street makeup.","I guess you're happy if you have some kind of balance in you. I'm a human being. I have days when I feel paralyzed, days when I feel like a slug. Then I have days when I have good energy, I've read the newspaper and I've done different things.","It's actually meditative to sit in a character for an extended period of time, realizing what your relationship is to who you're playing and then letting go, just being there.","'Six Feet Under' was so much about life. Sure, it had a lot to do with death, but that's the fun - that now I became a dead person.","I think the rigors of a TV schedule are brutal and 'Six Feet Under' wasn't a network schedule. We did 13 shows, we didn't do 22. I don't know how people do that. I really don't. I mean the shows are shorter, but wow, it's quite a discipline."],"Frances E. Willard":["Temperance is moderation in the things that are good and total abstinence from the things that are foul.","The world is wide, and I will not waste my life in friction when it could be turned into momentum.","In externals we advance with lightening express speed, in modes of thought and sympathy we lumber on in stage-coach fashion.","This seems to be the law of progress in everything we do; it moves along a spiral rather than a perpendicular; we seem to be actually going out of the way, and yet it turns out that we were really moving upward all the time."],"Frances Farmer":["But I was sure of one thing. If God were a father, with children, that cleanliness I had been feeling wasn't God.","I used to lie between cool, clean sheets at night after I'd had a bath, after I had washed my hair and scrubbed my knuckles and finger-nails and teeth. Then I could lie quite still in the dark with my face to the window with the trees in it, and talk to God.","I have learned that to have a good friend is the purest of all God's gifts, for it is a love that has no exchange of payment.","There comes a point when a dream becomes reality and reality becomes a dream.","I couldn't get that same feeling during the day, with my hands in dirty dish water and the hard sun showing up the dirtiness on the roof tops. And after a time, even at night, the feeling of God didn't last.","I didn't think then, and I still don't, that I was actually sick.","I just knew that God wasn't there. He was a man on a throne in Heaven, so he was easy to forget.","I think God just died of old age. And, when I realized that he wasn't any more, it didn't shock me. It seemed natural and right!","I went to Sunday School and liked the stories about Christ and the Christmas star. They were beautiful. They made you warm and happy to think about. But I didn't believe them.","I wondered a little why God was such a useless thing. It seemed a waste of time to have him. After that he became less and less, until he was... nothingness.","If a person is treated like a patient, they are apt to act like one.","It puzzled me that other people hadn't found out, too. God was gone. We were younger. We had reached past him. Why couldn't they see it? It still puzzles me.","That satisfied me until I began to figure that if God loved all his children equally, why did he bother about my red hat and let other people lose their fathers and mothers for always?","The more people pointed at me in scorn the more stubborn I got and when they began calling me the Bad Girl of West Seattle High, I tried to live up to it.","The Sunday School teacher talked too much in the way our grade school teacher used to when she told us about George Washington. Pleasant, pretty stories, but not true."],"Frances Fisher":["I was not meant to go deer hunting every fall.","I came from the theater playing leading roles, and when I started doing film and television, I felt as if I had to start from the bottom.","How wonderful it was to sit on a set with Norman Mailer and get to know him."],"Frances Hesselbein":["Good leaders make people's strengths effective and their weaknesses irrelevant.","Dispirited, unmotivated, unappreciated workers cannot compete in a highly competitive world.","Tears belong within the family.","I believe that tears should be very private, and no matter what issue or what situation, we should have a very dignified demeanor.","If you grow up in Germantown, Pennsylvania, as I did, 5:30 means 5:30.","There's something exhilarating about being in the mountains and talking about management and the future with Peter Drucker.","With a growing number of one-parent families in the country, the Girl Scout troop can be an indispensable and powerful positive factor.","It is not business, it is not government - it is the social sector that may yet save the society.","Donors do not reward good intentions.","It is what we do with our lives that counts.","Age is irrelevant.","At one time, there was a stereotype that your Girl Scout leader was the mother of a Brownie, but increasingly, we are having young businesswomen and professional women who are not mothers but care about children.","Women are working for part or all of their adult lives now. The possibilities are limitless, but you need to prepare.","Selling cookies is usually a girl's first exposure to the world of business. She learns how to meet the public, talk about a product, sell the product, and is responsible for collecting money, giving change, and delivering the product. That's quite a business venture for a 7-year-old.","I'll meet people and tell them what I do, and their first reaction is usually, 'Oh, I love Thin Mints!' And you know, they are awfully good.","In my life, I don't have roadblocks and obstacles. I might have something you would call a 'challenge.' I throw that out the window, and I call that a wonderful opportunity.","When you see a roadblock or challenge as an opportunity, it is amazing how you are already halfway there.","I did not want to take a troop. I was the mother of a little boy. I knew nothing about little girls.","I didn't have a career plan. But what I did was, whenever there was a door open and a new opportunity, I always looked into it and took a chance and walked through the door.","When people are speaking, they require our undivided attention. We focus on them; we listen very carefully. We listen to the spoken words and the unspoken messages. This means looking directly at the person, eyes connected; we forget we have a watch, just focusing for that moment on that person.","Listening is an art.","An exceptional career is one that provides an opportunity to serve. It is a satisfying career in which you can't wait to get up in the morning to begin! You have a sense of purpose and mission. You know why you do what you do. It is a response to a call to serve. Once we do that, everything flows positively.","When I choose what I do, I ask, 'Does it make a difference?'","Leadership is a matter of how to be - not how to do it.","Leadership is not a basket of tricks or strategies or skills that you pull out. Leadership begins with the quality of the person.","One of the management imperatives in the '90s is managing diversity. Whatever the organization, when the constituents of that organization look at the board and management staff, they need to find themselves.","The real leader redefines or defines the mission in a very powerful way so that people understand it; it permeates the organization.","At a young age, I learned from my grandmother that I should respect all people. Her lessons were defining moments in my life and determined the type of leader that I would become.","I thought I'd never leave Pennsylvania. And I never imagined that I'd one day have the chance to lead the largest organization for girls and women around the world.","A single person doesn't change an organization, but culture and good people do.","If you are building a corporate culture of greatness, you have to define culture on your own terms and with the people you work with.","In 1976, I was invited to interview for the CEO position of the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A.","I never had any question about the direction we were going in at the Girl Scouts. We shared our mission and research with all levels of leaders from the very beginning - a concept I created, using cups and saucers, called 'circular management.' Everyone was on a team; there were no superiors or subordinates. There was respect for all people.","I always had this philosophy that only the best is good enough for those who serve girls.","I had read everything Peter Drucker ever wrote.","The Millennial mindset is one on the pulse of changing technology. They multi-task and enjoy a challenge. They need projects that utilize their knowledge and skills that can connect with their philosophical or deeper interests.","Move beyond the old assumptions, practices, and language that can be barriers to equal access.","Carry a big basket. In other words, be open to new ideas, different partners, and new practices, and have a willingness to dump out the old and irrelevant to make room for new approaches.","Practice self-awareness, self-evaluation, and self-improvement. If we are aware that our manners - language, behavior, and actions - are measured against our values and principles, we are able to more easily embody the philosophy, leadership is a matter of how to be, not how to do.","Leadership flows from inner character and integrity of ambition, which inspires others to lend themselves to your organization's mission.","Management is the set of skills that can help get things done. Unfortunately, its practice is too often a bag of manipulative tricks to advance someone's own interests, which creates cynicism.","Not long after I was married, World War II began. My husband John volunteered for the Navy and was sent to Pensacola for training as a Naval Combat Air Crew photographer. It seemed a strange assignment for a young newspaper editor and writer, already exempt, but off he went, saying goodbye to our 18-month-old Johnny and me.","I lost my son in late 2011. He had been totally incapacitated from his neck down for the last eight years of his life, but his mind was alive and brilliant in those years. He even wrote a book, 'Allegheny Mountain,' lying at home in his hospital bed.","We do not know what lies ahead, yet whatever the challenge, leaders will rise, finding the heart, the language, the caring that embraces and sustains.","It takes courage for a leader to identify and confront self-imposed barriers, to put in place the personal strategies required to unleash the energy, innovation, and commitment to self-development.","I adored my grandparents and spent every weekend with Mama and Papa Wicks. They had seven children, so they needed a big house - and it seemed only logical to them to build into their house a pipe organ in a music room with a sixteen-foot ceiling.","In the future, it will not be the one big message, the one big voice, but millions of us, in our own way, healing, unifying, and experiencing that one defining moment when we recognize that sustaining the democracy is the common bottom line - whoever we are, whatever we do, wherever we are, the call is to sustain the democracy.","Girl Scouts helps girls make decisions that are right for them and offer support.","We are increasingly becoming a pluralistic nation.","We see change as a challenge, not as a threat.","We cannot ensure equal access or build upon our diverse strengths by sitting at our desks.","Social-sector organizations have to be better managed than for-profit organizations... because they have no margin of error.","Some corporations are extremely well managed; some nonprofit organizations are. It has nothing to do with the sector. It has to do with quality of management.","Simple questions can be profound, and answering them requires us to make stark and honest - and sometimes painful - self-assessments.","When it comes to communicating change at any time, the mission must be clear, and it must inspire.","Planning defines the particular place you want to be and how you intend to get there. It's a responsibility rather than a technique.","There is just one reason that we are placed on this Earth. That reason is to love and be loved - in that order."],"Frances Mayes":["Venice, the most touristy place in the world, is still just completely magic to me.","I think I went to Italy initially for the art, architecture, food and history, but I stayed there because of the people in Cortona.","I find that other countries have this or this, but Italy is the only one that has it all for me. The culture, the cuisine, the people, the landscape, the history. Just everything to me comes together there.","If you've got a plot the size of a car or a tiny yard in Italy, you're going to be growing tomatoes and basil and celery and carrots, and everybody is still connected to the land.","The Italians have their priorities right: They're driven, they do their work, but they really enjoy the day-to-day and they don't put off the enjoyment of the everyday for some future goal.","I loved every place I lived and traveled. London, Paris, Rome, Venice. I fell hard for Central America and Mexico. In each country, I had fantasies that I could live there.","Going to Europe as a budding cook opened my eyes to food in a different way. When I got to Italy, the first thing I did was put my little basil plants in the ground and watch them turn into big, healthy bushes.","What has impressed me the most about the Italians whose tables we've sat at is that they are traditional cooks but also outrageously innovative. These people are wild improvisers.","It's kind of amazing that people will travel because of a book. I admire that.","When I was twelve, I started reading Eudora Welty, Thomas Wolfe, Flannery O'Connor, James Agee, and - do we dare breathe the name - William Faulkner.","I was born and grew up in Fitzgerald, way down in south Georgia. It was a mill town and my family ran the cotton mill. My grandfather was mayor many times and my family felt deeply rooted to that spot.","Living in a small Italian hilltown, and having lived in a small town in south Georgia, I understand that you can recognize a family gene pool by the lift of an eyebrow, or the length of a neck, or a way of walking.","I got the idea that to write books would be the best way to spend a life. I never thought of anything else that seemed like half as much fun, although in my next life I would like to be an architect, too, so I can have an easier time restoring houses.","The longer you are in a place, the more you get under its layers.","In America, people are just so straightforward when they dislike things.","When my husband is away and I'm by myself, my neighbours will insist I eat with them every single night because they see it as unhealthy to eat by yourself.","I'm just fascinated by houses. In another life, I'd have probably trained as an architect. If I had enough money, I'd collect them like other people collect teapots. I don't know why I love them so much. I'm just very interested in the idea of a house as a metaphor for the way one lives."],"Frances McDormand":["I think that ageism is a cultural illness; it's not a personal illness.","My son smelled like a cinnamon bun, and that smell entered into my biological being, and it became an imperative that I keep him alive at all costs, so then there's this monster - this tiger or lion - that comes forward in you to protect them. And it doesn't stop. It doesn't matter if they become men or women.","With aging, you earn the right to be loyal to yourself.","When you lose a spouse, you're a widow or widower; when you lose your parents, you're an orphan. When you lose a child, there's no word in the English language for that position, that place that you're left.","I've made a professional reputation playing working-class, middle-class, American women. There's a real sense of stoicism and pragmatism and strength and lyricism of a woman like that.","I was often told that I wasn't a thing. 'She's not pretty enough. She's not tall enough. She's not thin enough. She's not fat enough.' I thought, 'O.K., someday you're going to be looking for someone not, not, not, not, and there I'll be.'","I love flying by the seat of my pants, going at something instinctually.","That's another great thing about getting older. Your life is written on your face.","My position has always been that the way people age and the signs that we show of aging is nature's way of tattooing. It's natural scarification, and the life you lead gives you the symbols and the emblems of your life, the road map you followed.","Female characters in literature are full. They're messy: they've got runny noses and burp and belch. Unfortunately, in film, female characters don't often have that kind of richness.","I'm not an actor because I want my picture taken. I'm an actor because I want to be part of the human exchange.","One of the reasons I am successful as a producer is that I've been a very successful housewife.","The only power you have is the word no.","The last scene in 'Moonlight,' that's one of the most extraordinary things I've ever seen on film in my lifetime. You see two men showing such tenderness towards each other. And it's bold; it's deep. It's complex. It's profound.","If you want to talk about cultural appropriation, we have to go back to the Greeks.","In comparison to other women in the world, perhaps I'm seen as smaller. But I've never had a problem thinking of myself as a large woman.","KWMR is my radio station, and I intend to have a job there as I get older. That's what I'm lobbying for. They don't need me. They've got plenty of people. But let's see if I can make myself indispensable.","Growing up a preacher's kid wasn't the easiest thing. Everybody's always watching you to see how you'll behave - or misbehave.","A movie set actually can be a good place to have a family atmosphere.","I never trusted good-looking boys.","My name is Frances Louise McDormand, formerly known as Cynthia Ann Smith. I was born in Gibson City, Ill., in 1957. I identify as gender-normative, heterosexual, and white-trash American. My parents were not white trash. My birth mother was white trash.","I am an ordinary person.","I'm trained in the theater, and acting, for me, is about the imaginative life I create for myself, not about basing it on something real. I think that whatever I create becomes the reality for the audience.","I portray female characters, so I have the opportunity to change the way people look at them. Even if I wasn't consciously doing that, it would happen anyway just because of how I present as a woman, or as a person. I present in a way that's not stereotypical, even if I'm playing a stereotypical role.","Here's what I have at my advantage: I've never been a personality. I've always been a character actor.","I'm not a depressive, but I certainly have mood swings. It's an occupational hazard, I would say, and I'm glad I'm in the occupation I'm in.","Unless I'm on a stage, I don't want to be the event in someone's day.","Guess what? I am an ordinary person.","There's something healing about tears.","I never read books - and still don't read books - to develop them.","I've given just as much of my life to that, and I practiced it with the same zeal, as I have acting. And I think that many of my skill sets from being a housewife I used for producing. Because you don't stop until it's done.","I've got a rubber face. It has always served me very well and really helps, especially as I get older, because I still have all my road map intact, and I can use it at will.","I tried taking a year off when Pedro was a toddler because I really wanted to be around, but it wasn't good for any of us.","The fact that I'm sleeping with the director may have something to do with it.","It's like some weird excuse for high school kids to vomit. It's not good. It's stupid. I'm sure that's not what St. Patrick's Day is supposed to be about, but who knows.","I was very good until I left home to go to a little college in West Virginia, and then I started to break some rules.","Most women's pictures are as boring and as formulaic as men's pictures. In place of a car chase or a battle scene, what you get is an extreme closeup of a woman breaking down.","I'm a character actress, plain and simple... Who can worry about a career? Have a life. Movie stars have careers - actors work, and then they don't work, and then they work again.","I don't think you can ever completely transform yourself on film, but if you do your job well, you can make people believe that you're the character you're trying to be.","Who can worry about a career? Have a life.","I like hard rock, and classic rock, and even metal.","I don't think of myself as a movie star and I can pretty easily convince other people that I'm not a movie star.","I haven't wanted to play a mother for a long time because I am one.","It's much easier to play supporting roles because that's what I do in my life: I support my son.","Certainly, a lot of the films I've worked on have ended up good movies, but they haven't always been the best experiences.","Movie stars have careers - actors work, and then they don't work, and then they work again.","It's a scary thing going into the workforce with a $50,000 debt and you've been trained as a classical theatre actor. There's always a depression in the theatre.","There's only two givens with choosing acting as a profession: one is you will always be unemployed, always, and it doesn't matter how much money you make, you're still always going to be unemployed; and that you have no power.","Because of my own insecurities about the way I look, I do sometimes sabotage the looks of my characters by making them as homely as possible. I've never done a glamour part. I'd like to some day, though I don't know if I could pull it off.","I went to my school careers counselors and said I wanted to be an actor, and they didn't know what to do. They showed me catalogues with pretty campuses and said, 'Oh, look, there's a theater building. Why don't you go there?'","I was completely naive about the business of being an actor. My family didn't go to the theater or to the movies. We watched television like every 1960s small-town American family, and I certainly never thought about being on TV. I thought I was going to be a classical actor in the grand tradition.","I was too old, too young, too fat, too thin, too tall, too short, too blond, too dark - but at some point, they're going to need the other. So I'd get really good at being the other.","I became interested in educating people in the variety of ways in which women can express their emotion. Which is much easier to do in a large role than in a supporting role to a male protagonist. In general, the women in a supporting role to a male protagonist - cry a lot.","I'm not really that interested in going back to playing small supporting roles.","The crew on 'Three Bilboards,' by the way, is one of the best I've ever worked with. And that's not hyperbole.","I swear a lot; I always have. So does my husband. Our son, surprisingly, does not swear much at all.","I'm from working-class, blue-collar America, and I don't believe that people in that socioeconomic strata wait until they're 40 to have children.","Something happened culturally: No one is supposed to age past 45 - sartorially, cosmetically, attitudinally.","Everybody dresses like a teenager. Everybody dyes their hair. Everybody is concerned about a smooth face.","We are on red alert when it comes to how we are perceiving ourselves as a species. There's no desire to be an adult.","Adulthood is not a goal. It's not seen as a gift.","I want to be revered. I want to be an elder; I want to be an elderess.","Getting older and adjusting to all the things that biologically happen to you is not easy to do and is a constant struggle and adjustment.","I have not mutated myself in any way.","We don't need a lot of initiatives for women in film; what we need is money.","All the skills of housewifery are the ones I'm using as a producer.","Unfortunately, any girl - unless you're playing the action hero - is going to end up at some point handcuffed, gagged, and waiting for the hero to save her.","My politics are private, but many of my feminist politics cross over into my professional life.","I know I'm profane. And outspoken.","I went to high school in a steel town in Pennsylvania.","Even though I'm an actor, I've gone to productions where there has been someone whose work is known in film, and you can't take your eyes off them. It unbalances the production. Whether they're good or not, it doesn't matter.","I think awards are good for the movie. They can bring a new audience to the movie. I've always claimed that things like that don't get you work. Work gets you work. That's my blue-collar, protestant work ethic.","Yale? I was at Yale on a scholarship.","A 90-minute time frame is not long enough to tell a good female story, and that's why long-format television has become so great for female storytelling and for female performers and directors and writers.","It's kind of a subversive act to tell a story of a woman past a certain age, to develop a four-hour movie based on a marriage and a story of two people past middle age.","Long-format television is a better way to tell a female story.","I am not a director or a writer, but a filmmaker.","I read books. Remember those? I read them, on paper."],"Frances O'Connor":["I wasn't tempted to go into academia for a second.","I actually didn't like Jane Austen. I was more into the Brontes. They were so wild and passionate. I thought there was something a bit tame about Austen.","The thing about the classics it that they are such great characters, they have a great deal of depth and different layers to them. I always find that very stimulating to play.","I was quietly rebellious. My parents thought I was very good but secretly I did things like saying I was staying in one place and going somewhere else instead. My older sister was openly rebellious and would tell my parents where to go, but I never did that.","I love watching Hollywood movies - I just don't know if I'd be happy doing a 'Jurassic Park.'","In Australia I was seen as somebody who did only very modern, contemporary stuff. Then as soon as I went overseas I did two period pieces so it was like, 'When are you going to get out of the corsets?' And I was thinking I just got into them!","I am really glad I was raised Catholic. I like the fundamental aspects of that religion. I think they give you great grounding in terms of having a moral code. But I do not subscribe to any religion specifically now."],"Frances O'Grady":["Never has a strong, responsible trade union movement been so needed. With austerity policies biting hard and with no evidence that they are working, people at work need the TUC to speak up for them now more than ever.","The backwoodsmen are muttering about making Britain's draconian union laws - already among the toughest in Europe - harsher still. And parts of the media will continue to attack public service pensions, as if school meals staff, refuse collectors and healthcare workers have no right to a decent retirement.","The difficulty for the Government is there's this ideological straitjacket of the market will provide, let the market rip and everything will work out... It's back to trickle-down economics, which, it's plain to see, have not delivered.","Voting to go on strike is not a decision working people take lightly and is always accompanied by a strong sense of injustice at work. The impact of losing a day's pay is significant, not least for those in the lowest paid jobs who are already on the tightest budgets.","You just wish sometimes that people would treat you like a human being rather than seeing your gender first and who you are second.","All the evidence shows very clearly that if you are a member of a trade union you are likely to get better pay, more equal pay, better health and safety, more chance to get training, more chance to have conditions of work that help if you have caring responsibilities... the list goes on!","I worry that some politicians still think we are living in the 1950s where the man is the main breadwinner and the woman works for pin money. Actually, most families where there are two parents depend on two incomes to get by.","I do know what it's like to worry about bills, I do know what it's like to worry about even finding a child-minder, never mind paying them.","I like independent films... European films. I do go and see popular films as well because my kids force me.","Ordinary people who have lots of good ideas want more than a suggestion box, and they need a union to represent that thinking.","As long as the number one worry for people, keeping them up at nights, is whether they're going to have a job in the morning, then they are less likely to resist unfair changes, or unfair treatment, or cuts in real pay at work.","There is this sense of David Cameron leading a Government that's badly out of touch with ordinary people's lives. I'd absolutely welcome the opportunity to show all political leaders what life is like for most people.","A business is good if it gives a decent day's reward for a decent day's work, treats people decently, and gives them a voice at the top.","I suspect there are people in all walks of life who need to be dragged into the 21st century in terms of attitudes towards women.","Each day more coalition MPs in seats outside the South East come out against George Osborne's regional pay cut plans, and Vince Cable now claims they are dead.","The dominant economic approach of the last thirty years is now on its last legs. Letting the market rip and an indifference to inequality are now seen as important causes of the greatest economic crash since the 1930s.","In the U.S. the powerful critics of austerity such as Paul Krugman and Robert Reich rightly identify the decline of 'labor' as a problem, and renewing trade unionism part of the solution. Our opportunity is to make the same case in the UK.","The TUC's new slogan 'a future that works' sets a profound challenge. Austerity and rapid deficit reduction is failing in its own terms, but even at its best it is short-sighted, muddle-through politics with no vision of a new economic model.","Governments of all stripes want to deliver growth and rebalance their economies now that they have learned the hard way that, left to their own devices, markets pick expensive banking losers.","The UK has a poor investment record. According to IMF data, we have come seventh out of the top seven industrialised countries since 1999.","From the ashes of a financial crash, there is a chance to create a new economic settlement that is more equal, sustainable and democratic.","I came from a family where joining a union was the expected thing to do. I've always believed that the relationship between an employer and an individual worker is fundamentally unequal.","Although there's a lot of focus on the Lib Dems, we need to keep our eyes on the far right of the Tories, who I suspect will become increasingly impatient in their appetite for tax cuts, deregulation and shrinking the state even further.","When I look at my daughter, who's 24, she is much more confident than I ever was and her expectations are higher. But I worry that there is a backlash brewing against progress on equality.","My first hero, as a teenager, was James Connolly. I remember discovering that he was a feminist, and that was an eye-opener, coming from a man of such poverty.","Britain is a textbook case of how growing inequality leads to economic crisis. The years before the crash were marked by a sharp rise in remortgaging and the growth of 0 percent balance transfer credit cards. By 2008 the UK had the highest ratio of household debt to GDP of any major economy.","There is nothing that says unions have a God-given right to be there. We have to work at it and make ourselves relevant to every section of the workforce.","RFK was a compelling figure because he was willing to challenge his audiences, and in turn connect with them in a unique way. Kennedy showed that our values define us and can inspire others to believe in the possibility of change and a better society.","It is not natural or inevitable that half the world goes hungry; that the freedom of markets trumps protection of the planet; or that citizens' rights come second to those of corporations.","I cherish the creation of public space and services, especially health, housing and the comprehensive education system which dared to give so many of us ideas 'above our station.'","I want a society that provides decent jobs for those who can work and decent security for those can't.","I'd be happy to have regular face-to-face meetings at Downing Street with David Cameron to argue the case for alternative economic policies.","Washing dishes as a 17-year-old in an Oxford college and seeing the privileged lifestyles of the undergraduates there convinced me that a system that allowed luxury for the few at the expense of the many needed to be challenged.","The implication that women work for pin money and can manage on a worse pension, presumably by relying on husbands, riles. But even more galling for women is that few government ministers seem to even appreciate the value of the work they do.","My impression is that most women public service workers have a long fuse. Precisely because they care so deeply about services, more than anyone, they still want to find a sensible and fair negotiated agreement. But their patience has run out.","I am a feminist and I have no problems being called that.","Would I describe myself as new Labour? I'm Labour, organised Labour. I think labels have a limited use and that's where you really get into boy stuff sometimes, just sticking on labels.","I think being a mother helps keep your feet on the ground. There's very little dignity in parenthood. It's a great leveller.","The image of the unions is still not in tune with where we actually are, which is fifty-fifty men and women, with an increasing number of women at the top. I think it is changing, but I'm not complacent about this."],"Frances Perkins":["Most of man's problems upon this planet, in the long history of the race, have been met and solved either partially or as a whole by experiment based on common sense and carried out with courage.","The door might not be opened to a woman again for a long, long time, and I had a kind of duty to other women to walk in and sit down on the chair that was offered, and so establish the right of others long hence and far distant in geography to sit in the high seats.","Being a woman has only bothered me in climbing trees.","The quality of his being one with the people, of having no artificial or natural barriers between him and them, made it possible for him to be a leader without ever being or thinking of being a dictator.","In America, public opinion is the leader.","But with the slow menace of a glacier, depression came on. No one had any measure of its progress; no one had any plan for stopping it. Everyone tried to get out of its way.","To one who believes that really good industrial conditions are the hope for a machine civilization, nothing is more heartening than to watch conference methods and education replacing police methods."],"Frances Wright":["Equality is the soul of liberty; there is, in fact, no liberty without it.","The existing principle of selfish interest and competition has been carried to its extreme point; and, in its progress, has isolated the heart of man, blunted the edge of his finest sensibilities, and annihilated all his most generous impulses and sympathies.","And when did mere preaching do any good? Put something in the place of these things. Fill the vacuum of the mind.","The hired preachers of all sects, creeds, and religions, never do, and never can, teach any thing but what is in conformity with the opinions of those who pay them.","Know why you believe, understand what you believe, and possess a reason for the faith that is in you.","Man has been adjudged a social animal.","There is but one honest limit to the rights of a sentient being; it is where they touch the rights of another sentient being.","If we bring not the good courage of minds covetous of truth, and truth only, prepared to hear all things, and decide upon all things, according to evidence, we should do more wisely to sit down contented in ignorance, than to bestir ourselves only to reap disappointment.","Awaken its powers, and it will respect itself.","How are men to be secured in any rights without instruction; how to be secured in the equal exercise of those rights without equality of instruction? By instruction understand me to mean knowledge - just knowledge; not talent, not genius, not inventive mental powers.","The sciences have ever been the surest guides to virtue.","A necessary consequent of religious belief is the attaching ideas of merit to that belief, and of demerit to its absence.","But while human liberty has engaged the attention of the enlightened, and enlisted the feelings of the generous of all civilized nations, may we not enquire if this liberty has been rightly understood?","He who lives in the single exercise of his mental faculties, however usefully or curiously directed, is equally an imperfect animal with the man who knows only the exercise of muscles.","Instead of establishing facts, we have to overthrow errors; instead of ascertaining what is, we have to chase from our imaginations what is not.","It will appear evident upon attentive consideration that equality of intellectual and physical advantages is the only sure foundation of liberty, and that such equality may best, and perhaps only, be obtained by a union of interests and cooperation in labor.","Look into the nature of things. Search out the grounds of your opinions, the for and against.","Now here is a departure from the first principle of true ethics. Here we find ideas of moral wrong and moral right associated with something else than beneficial action. The consequent is, we lose sight of the real basis of morals, and substitute a false one.","Our religious belief usurps the place of our sensations, our imaginations of our judgment. We no longer look to actions, trace their consequences, and then deduce the rule; we first make the rule, and then, right or wrong, force the action to square with it.","Speak of change, and the world is in alarm. And yet where do we not see change?","Surely it is time to examine into the meaning of words and the nature of things, and to arrive at simple facts, not received upon the dictum of learned authorities, but upon attentive personal observation of what is passing around us.","The simplest principles become difficult of practice, when habits, formed in error, have been fixed by time, and the simplest truths hard to receive when prejudice has warped the mind.","We have seen that no religion stands on the basis of things known; none bounds its horizon within the field of human observation; and, therefore, as it can never present us with indisputable facts, so must it ever be at once a source of error and contention.","We hear of the wealth of nations, of the powers of production, of the demand and supply of markets, and we forget that these words mean no more, if they mean any thing, then the happiness, and the labor, and the necessities of men.","Pets, like their owners, tend to expand a little over the Christmas period.","If they exert it not for good, they will for evil; if they advance not knowledge, they will perpetuate ignorance.","These will vary in every human being; but knowledge is the same for every mind, and every mind may and ought to be trained to receive it.","It is in vain that we would circumscribe the power of one half of our race, and that half by far the most important and influential.","Do we exert our own liberties without injury to others - we exert them justly; do we exert them at the expense of others - unjustly. And, in thus doing, we step from the sure platform of liberty upon the uncertain threshold of tyranny.","Religion may be defined thus: a belief in, and homage rendered to, existences unseen and causes unknown.","However novel it may appear, I shall venture the assertion, that, until women assume the place in society which good sense and good feeling alike assign to them, human improvement must advance but feebly.","All that I say is, examine, inquire. Look into the nature of things. Search out the grounds of your opinions, the for and against. Know why you believe, understand what you believe, and possess a reason for the faith that is in you.","Let us unite on the safe and sure ground of fact and experiment, and we can never err; yet better, we can never differ."],"Francesca Annis":["However successful you are, there is no substitute for a close relationship. We all need them.","I'm one of the great unemployed looking for the next job. I'm waiting for the right offer. Like anyone, I want something that turns me on inside.","Sometimes sushi is just superb, and other times there's nothing like a great big steak. It depends where your taste buds are at the time.","My children were brought up with their grandparents, and I was brought up with my grandparents. I think the continuity of moving through life together gives people a certain pride and sense of security.","Too often, older women are seen as victims, but I know lots of formidable women who have marvellous jobs as well as a full erotic life, and children and friends and family.","There is not enough celebration of companionship. Relationships aren't just about eroticism and sexuality.","Truly charismatic people, in my experience, don't come along very often.","Eat well and sleep well. That will feed your nervous system and your psyche. As you get older, you look how you feel.","The biggest privilege I've had in my life is being able to make a choice. If you make a choice, it can't be a wrong choice because it seemed like a good idea at the time.","You can be revered for all sorts of qualities, but to be truly charismatic is rare. Elizabeth Taylor was, for me, one of those rarities.","Thank God we're not like America. Everyone wants to look like they're 20. In Europe we admire grown-up women; I think men revere older women.","Fame and stardom sat very easily on Elizabeth Taylor's shoulders.","Exposure makes you famous, not just good work. Famous is being plastered everywhere.","I think people should do whatever they want to do. That's the point. Why should you care what other people think or say? You're not living in their pocket.","I maintain the rather old-fashioned view that this is my work and it's in the public arena, but that doesn't entitle everyone to know what happened at home before coming here.","As you grow older, your whole life becomes very rich, multifaceted.","Everything has changed. An interview has become such a confrontational thing. It makes you very defensive.","Having children with someone is the real bond.","I am not a fanatic about anything. I do what I can do when I've got the time.","I am not going to share my private life with millions of people. I don't find a need to do that and nobody else close to me does either.","I am pretty self-indulgent.","I can feel the 60S looming. In my profession, I've just moved along with my age. By thinking in decades, rather than whether someone's 42 or 47, you can give yourself a whole 10 years to turn yourself around in.","I consulted a Chinese herbalist and spent two weeks on an island off the coast of Zanzibar. I was away from any kind of contemporary technology.","I couldn't imagine playing someone young now; it would be so boring.","I didn't choose to be an actress.","I do find acting cathartic.","I do think it's important to live in the present because in that way you won't be living in a state of regret.","I don't believe in expending energy on something you can't do anything about. If there was some easy way of fixing things, I'd probably do it.","I don't buy the tabloids, but you're surrounded by it all and people tell you things they've read. I'd be sitting on a train looking over someone's shoulder and thinking: That's familiar... oh my God, it's me.","I don't need a piece of paper to suggest that I can commit myself.","I go on giving interviews because I've been brought up to support the projects I'm involved in. When you've enjoyed working on a production, you want to do them a favour.","I have made a public statement about me and Ralph by being seen with him. I don't need to make any other. You can live the way you want.","I have yet to see a drama that puts forward women who are successful and also have a family... they are nearly always seen as victims.","I think people have surgery for psychological reasons more than because of their looks.","I used to suffer from excessive pride. Well, I got over that one.","I was asked to be in Vogue but I said no. I didn't want to advertise make-up. I didn't want to be seen as a sex symbol.","I'll dance to anything: Bob Marley or rap.","I'm an actress, not a pinup.","I'm often asked if I regret not going to Hollywood. I'm glad I didn't go, because if I had I wouldn't have my extended family, which is the fabric of my life. Only recently have I realised how special and unusual it is.","I'm trying to learn to smoke, which is rather weird when everyone is trying to stop. I'm not a smoker. But my character only smokes as an affectation.","I've never been married and I've no more desire to be married now than I ever have. I hate bureaucracy and I am not religious.","If people think I look good, it's the make-up.","Judi Dench and Ian McKellen taught me how to work hard and respect the theatre.","Roman's wife Sharon Tate had been murdered by Charles Manson the year before, but Roman had been through so much leaving the Warsaw ghetto that he was very strong and private.","Some actors get fired up by the sound of the audience. I just want to retreat.","The first thing you have to do is accept that decay sets in and there's nothing you can do about it.","The minute anyone's getting anxious I say, You must eat and you must sleep. They're the two vital elements for a healthy life.","The thing about doing anything artificial to your hair is that you have to look after it. So you're always vulnerable to the weather and time.","The wonderful thing about acting is you move along with your decade. The older you get, the more interesting the parts you get to play and you bring more of your personal experience to the part.","When I was starting out, young actresses had the studio system to protect them. Now you have a host of sharks, from your agent to your publicist to your lawyer.","You can love more than one person in your life, but things will be different. There'll be a different dynamic. Needs and desires change.","You have to be careful not to let your fear stop you doing things. It's very exciting to test yourself.","I don't want three million people digesting my private life over their cornflakes.","Each decade, I've lived in that decade, so I could easily shed the '20s, the '30s, the '40s.","From one till seven, when we moved to England, I spoke only Portuguese. But I can't speak a word of it now.","I like working in theatre now and I think that once you've done a certain amount of films most actors love working in the theatre because of the camaraderie.","In films people basically work for the camera, you know, and that's why actors can hate each other and not be speaking to each other and still look as if they're in love because really they're loving the camera loving them.","My parents were hugely supportive like that. I was always the best - it's so embarrassing, isn't it? I was always the best at everything.","I don't think the media circus has ever been a shock to my life seeing as I was with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor when I was 17.","I turned down a lot of films.","I don't regret the passing of time. I try to live in the present, which should mean my life's full.","After all my various relationships I find myself now home alone.","The funny thing is I'm not bothered or sad about being on my own - after all I've never had a husband.","I have got a few misters interested but nobody special these days.","I've always kept fit but I've been doing gym and yoga and will be throwing my stilettoes away for a while!","I was always going to be a dancer - I drifted into acting.","I was seen dancing at school by a director, who asked me to be in a TV play. And it had a huge impact. So I think that's what really started me off.","We all know now that people can look good for their age. It isn't so extraordinary, I don't know why people go on about it so much.","So many stars lose their way, and with success become more neurotic, not less so.","Everything is about class in England, whether it's upper, lower or middle. Why should that be?","Everyone has class, one class or another.","I never pursued being 'famous.'","It's not so much the dressing up, but I love the idea of moving and existing in a different time.","An interview has become such a confrontational thing. It makes you very defensive.","From 1 till 7, when we moved to England, I spoke only Portuguese.","In the theatre, once you've gone about eight rows back, everybody else is just listening to you. You're very small, and nobody can really see what you're doing.","I think you live a fuller life with someone else, you know, you're firing on all cylinders. It can be a nightmare at times, we all know that, but nevertheless in the end I think to have someone else's input on anything - a book, a meal, your children, life, a walk - is fantastic.","I come from a very hospitable, close, Catholic, matriarchal family.","In Europe, we admire grown-up women; I think men revere older women.","I'm not bothered or sad about being on my own - after all, I've never had a husband.","I have always done exercise because I was a dancer, and it is probably good for you. I have done yoga consistently.","I can easily sleep from nine to 13 hours a night.","I've never been too afraid of what other people have said, especially when I was younger, but I suppose that was the arrogance of youth.","I like having a good time. It's probably my mother's Brazilian genes in me - party, party.","My mother was madly adventurous. My father was an actor - he worked with Gielgud - and my mother came from a very wealthy family. She definitely wasn't meant to marry an actor, but she eloped with him one lunch-time."],"Francesca Lia Block":["I love Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton. I also love more cerebral poets like H.D. and Emily Dickinson. My parents subscribed to a monthly poetry periodical, and as a teenager I was introduced to Denise Levertov, who was an influence.","Writing is literally transformative. When we read, we are changed. When we write, we are changed. It's neurological. To me, this is a kind of magic.","Writing is very cathartic for me. As a teacher, I hear many students say that writing can be painful and exhausting. It can be, but ultimately I believe that if you push through, the process is healing and exhilarating.","I think depression creates in me an urgent need to write, but I also believe that daily stress, and even the positive 'stress' of intense happiness, can compel me to express myself through the written word.","It's scary to become a woman in this world. We have to understand that some of the messages we get, messages that we are not enough, are there to keep our power in check. We can't buy into these messages.","I am constantly thinking ahead to what I want to write about in the future, and when I'm done with one project, I give myself a little time and then start the next one.","Write with abandon and no constraints for first draft. Cut brutally and save in separate files on second draft. Add conflict; don't be afraid to make your characters suffer. Read what you love. Write what you love. Love."],"Francesca Lo Schiavo":["When I met Dante I didn't work in the movies, but I enjoyed so much the movies. I worked in interior design and when I met Dante, we tried to do something together.","There is no difficult moment working together because when we start a new project, Dante starts to make all the sketches and I can see the vision of the movie and then I start my job."],"Francesca da Rimini":["Come dress yourself in love, let the journey begin.","Search for beauty without features, something deeper than any signs.","I do suspect that this world is hell."],"Francesco Carrozzini":["To me, the main and most exciting thing about photography is to meet people. The picture is the result of what happened between me and them on the set.","I always saw photography as a way to get to film.","I'm not interested in just beautiful girls and beautiful clothes.","I'm more interested in photographing people who have done something, like writers or directors - even billionaires - as long as I can study them before I photograph them."],"Francesco Guicciardini":["Since there is nothing so well worth having as friends, never lose a chance to make them.","The return we reap from generous actions is not always evident.","I know no man who feels deeper disgust than I do at the ambition, avarice, and profligacy of the priesthood, as well because every one of these vices is odious in itself, as because each of them separately and all of them together are utterly abhorrent in men making profession of a life dedicated to God.","Waste no time with revolutions that do not remove the causes of your complaints but simply change the faces of those in charge.","Affairs that depend on many rarely succeed.","One who imitates what is bad always goes beyond his model; while one who imitates what is good always comes up short of it.","Let no one trust so entirely to natural prudence as to persuade himself that it will suffice to guide him without help from experience.","Like other men, I have sought honours and preferment, and often have obtained them beyond my wishes or hopes. Yet never have I found in them that content which I had figured beforehand in my mind. A strong reason, if we well consider it, why we should disencumber ourselves of vain desires.","Pay no heed to those who tell you that they have relinquished place and power of their own accord, and from their love of quiet. For almost always they have been brought to this retirement by their insufficiency and against their will.","Conspiracies, since they cannot be engaged in without the fellowship of others, are for that reason most perilous; for as most men are either fools or knaves, we run excessive risk in making such folk our companions.","There is nothing so fleeting as the memory of benefits received.","Ambition is not in itself an evil; nor is he to be condemned whose spirit prompts him to seek fame by worthy and honourable ways.","It is a great matter to be in authority over others; for authority, if it be rightly used, will make you feared beyond your actual resources.","The affairs of this world are so shifting and depend on so many accidents, that it is hard to form any judgment concerning the future; nay, we see from experience that the forecasts even of the wise almost always turn out false.","If you attempt certain things at the right time, they are easy to accomplish - in fact, they almost get done by themselves. If you undertake them before the time is right, not only will they fail, but they will often become impossible to accomplish even when the time would have been right.","Few revolutions succeed, and when they do, you often discover they did not gain what you hoped for, and you condemn yourself to perpetual fear, as the parties you defeated may always regain power and work for your ruin."],"Francesco Quinn":["I've lived an amazing life. There's no reason to focus on the bad. They teach you that in racing school. Keep your eye where you want your front tire to be. You don't want to be stuck in the rut? Then don't look at the rut. Always look at where you want to go.","There are two kinds of people on this Earth: Those who are content and those who are not.","I could be winning the decathlon in high school, which I've won twice, yet, if my dad is in the audience, 'Oh look! It's Anthony Quinn.' And I'm like, 'Hello? Kid just got a gold medal. Hello? I'm over here.'","I was born into a profession in which my love of words, chosen with care for their meaning and nuance, was extremely important, not only to me, but also to the people with whom I worked with.","What I'd like to pass on to my children is the thirst for knowledge. It's something I experience every day that I learned from my father. He always taught me that no matter how long you've done something, you can always learn something new and be better at what you do.","I learned from an early age that my heritage, my love for people, and my desire to be a vehicle that can be used through my voice, that my expressions and actions can transport a person to experience a scene from the past, present and future."],"Francesco Totti":["Football, to me, is a passion, more than a game. It is everything. But more than anything, it is love for Roma. I have always been Roma. There has never been anything else.","I was born Roman, and I'll die Roman. I'll never leave this team or my city.","There aren't many athletes who follow their hearts. They choose to go somewhere to win more and earn more money. They're like gypsies.","I would tell the young Francesco Totti to repeat everything that the older Totti did - if he's able to!","To the children of yesterday, who have grown up and become parents, and to the children of today, who perhaps shout 'Tottigol,' I'd like to think that, for you, my career has become a fairytale for you to pass on.","Roma come before everything else.","I am fortunate to have only worn one shirt in my career. It is something that is fundamental to me. It is something I have always wanted: to be one of these few who wear only one shirt - a fan and a player of the same team.","During a game, it comes down to your mind - the pressure. There are loads of other aspects, too. Many people say taking penalties is easy, but when you're stood over one, that's not the case. It's in no way easy. The goal really does become a lot smaller.","Over the years, I've tried to express myself through my feet, which have made everything simpler for me ever since I was a child.","Winning one league title at Roma, to me, is worth winning 10 at Juventus or Real Madrid.","When I do retire, I will miss the trips with the team, the jokes with my teammates, the habits: having breakfast with them, playing with them, all the little things.","I am not thinking about life after football, but I know it will be another life, another world.","Playing further up the pitch, you have more opportunities to score and provide assists, and it's something I liked right from the start.","When you grow up, you gain experience and realise what youre capable of.","I find it easier to strike the ball with my instep across goal. But I've scored in loads of other ways, too.","Before being a player, I was a diehard fan of Roma, so I know what the fans felt when we won.","Being born Roman and Romanisti is a privilege.","The end of my playing career was May 28, 2017. That, for me, was an historic day. I'll carry it with me forever. It will be hard to explain to people the feelings and emotions I felt that day.","The first part of my life, as a player, has ended but now I'm heading into an equally important part as a manager, hoping to do as well as I did on the field.","The game has given me so much, and I tried to give so much back to the people who have showed me so much love day after day.","I never thought about money; otherwise, I would have left aged 26 when Real Madrid and Barcelona wanted me.","The Santiago Bernabeu is an amazing stadium."],"Francia Raisa":["I really like Neutrogena for skin care and CoverGirl makeup. I can't stand heavy makeup. I feel like my skin can't breathe, and CoverGirl is really light.","My eyelashes are divas, so they will like a mascara brand one week or for a month, and then they'll just stop working for it. I go back and forth between Maybelline and Cover Girl, and then I carry around a primer, too.","I'm glad I went through all the normal teenage dramas that a lot of people go through. I can really relate to 'Secret Life' because I witnessed those similar struggles.","I was a dancer when I got discovered, and I started working immediately. I started being in commercials and doing guest star roles. My first big thing, which happened maybe six months after being discovered, was 'Bring It On: All or Nothing.'","I still have a lot of my friends from high school. You just know who is there for you for real, and who is trying to get something out of you.","It was hard at school because, growing up, some people wanted to be friends with me just because they wanted to get to my dad and say that they had met him and had gone to our house. I didn't understand it at the time, but the older I got and the more aware of it I became, it started becoming hard.","I like to carry a concealer palette that has a green, a yellow, and a tan color. I like to carry the green one because when I have a pimple, it's good to use that to contrast the red. Then you put the yellow over it, and it helps it disappear.","I love Clinique. Their moisturizer is amazing. My skin tends to be really oily, but then at times I'm dry, and that's the perfect amount of moisturizer.","Even though I'm Hispanic, I'm so white.","Find a type of exercise that you love - whether it's dance, soccer, softball, anything - just as long as it keeps you active. If you love it, you'll dedicate yourself to it and stay involved."],"Francine Busby":["I was outraged to learn that the president wanted to outsource operations at some American ports to the United Arab Emirates.","It's the No.1 issue with people I talk to, whether Republican, Democrat or independent. They want to see the way business is done in Washington change.","Like you, I'm fed up with business as usual in Washington. Send me to Congress, and I won't tweak our broken system. I'll shut it down.","This is not about being liberal. This is not about being conservative. This is about making sure our government works for all Americans."],"Francine Pascal":["No matter when you were born or where, puberty is the same. It's the same for your parents as it is for you - what's happening in your body dictates everything.","I always had a fascination with twins.","When I first thought of the idea for 'Sweet Valley High,' I loved the idea of high school as microcosm of the real world. And what I really liked was how it moved things on from 'Sleeping Beauty'-esque romance novels where the girl had to wait for the hero. This would be girl-driven, very different, I decided - and indeed it is.","I always loved reading. Growing up, my favorite book was 'A Child's Garden of Verses,' by Robert Louis Stevenson.","I get some of my ideas from watching my three daughters, but most of them come from my own memories of growing up. I can remember how romantic I was, not just about love, but romance in the classic sense - the romantic ideals: of honor and truth, of loyalty, sacrifice and fairness. Those were the elements that made a story satisfying to me.","Since I was a small child, I was always writing either poems or plays... plays in which I had the starring part.","I know you think that when you're 35, 45, 55, you'll be different. But I'm going to let you in on a bit of a secret. You're going to look different, and your life is going to be different, but in your head you'll always be that 16-year-old girl.","I like to play poker. I have a nice poker group that's been going on for years.","I don't do rewrites. I put all the pages in a pile next to the typewriter.","The same way that some people can play the piano, I can do plots! They just come!"],"Francine Prose":["A work of art can start you thinking about some aesthetic or philosophical problem; it can suggest some new method, some fresh approach to fiction.","Fact-checking is so boring compared to writing fiction.","I know a lot of Eastern Europeans, and because of what they have been through and what they have seen, they have an attitude where they are not easily fooled.","I work really long days and I work seven day weeks.","If things are going well I can easily spend twelve hours a day writing, but not writing writing, just thinking and revising and taking a comma out and putting it back in.","I went through college in the 1960s without having any idea that I was going to have to make a living. When I graduated in 1968 it was quite a shock to find out that there was a world out there and that it wasn't going to support me.","Of course, I've always read. I started when I was four years old and just didn't stop. I read all the time.","I wrote about four novels before I wrote a word of journalism.","I think poets are much more dramatic, more theatrical than fiction writers.","A lot of girls who turn into something remarkable start off as irrepressible, confident and a handful.","I'm in a rage all of the time.","I think of myself as someone with a kind of Tourette's. I cannot help saying the thing you're not supposed to say.","For any writer, the ability to look at a sentence and see what's superfluous, what can be altered, revised, expanded, and, especially, cut, is essential. It's satisfying to see that sentence shrink, snap into place, and ultimately emerge in a more polished form: clear, economical, sharp.","Long before the idea of a writer's conference was a glimmer in anyone's eye, writers learned by reading the work of their predecessors. They studied meter with Ovid, plot construction with Homer, comedy with Aristophanes; they honed their prose style by absorbing the lucid sentences of Montaigne and Samuel Johnson.","I remember, when I was a little kid, I was good at sports, and I could jump off the high board. And then puberty hit, and suddenly I was looking to boys for direction. I remember that as a great loss.","'One Hundred Years of Solitude' convinced me to drop out of Harvard graduate school. The novel reminded me of everything my Ph.D. program was trying to make me forget. Thank you, Gabriel Garcia Marquez.","I can no more reread my own books than I can watch old home movies or look at snapshots of myself as a child. I wind up sitting on the floor, paralyzed by grief and nostalgia."],"Francine Rivers":["When we love like Jesus does, lives change for the better.","Well, I always wanted to write from the time I was very little, and my mother encouraged me. She wrote a journal from the time she was 15 up until about the age of 76.","I had been raised in the church, but I wasn't a Christian. I had a lot of head knowledge but no heart knowledge.","I start work by spending time in personal Bible study. Because my projects center on a question in my own faith walk, I find Bible study essential. And God gives me scriptures daily that speak to the question with which I'm struggling.","Like everyone else, there are days when I don't want to go to work. However, writing is a job like anything else.","I'll often dream about characters before I start writing their stories.","The goal is to have every character take on a life of his or her own. Sometimes characters will come into the story that I haven't planned.","That is one of the reasons I write: to feel the Presence of God and know He is speaking to me in a very personal way, instructing me, correcting me, redirecting me.","My job is to allow the character to live and breathe - and become as real to the reader as he or she is to me.","I became a Christian late, in my late 30s, so I had a lot of things that I was bringing into my Christian life that I regret. And I had a lot of questions about faith, so that's where I start when I write.","I actually worked in the general market for many years writing steamy historical romance, and I had more freedom in the Christian market than I ever did in the general market to write about any issue that I needed to write about.","My favorite book is 'Redeeming Love.' It was my first as a born-again Christian, my statement of faith, and the most exciting year I've spent writing anything.","I want to see Christian fiction speak to the hard and real issues that tear people's lives apart."],"Francis Alys":["In the eye of the tornado, there's no more high and low, no floor and sky.","What I can't tell with a photo I will tell with a painting, and what I can't tell with a painting I will tell with a video or text sometimes, et cetera.","We've lost control of this planet somewhere. There's an echo in that kind of tornado situation, where you're powerless facing those phenomena.","I have no problem twisting the facts if it's the only way I can be true to the moment.","Can that make any sense - a Belgian artist living in Mexico and working in Afghanistan?","Formulating the proposal is about 80% of the actual time of the process. In the end, the time spent filming, editing and postproduction is a very small proportion of the total time you spend in the production of the film.","I am interested in seeing how a certain situation can develop with potential accidents. First, I am inspired by the acts of potential collaborators. It tends to be an action they have already done in a different context. I am very clear about the rules of the game, but once it's launched, I don't intervene at all.","I am always fascinated by the way kids create their own world. That is something I am very attentive to anywhere I go."],"Francis Arinze":["The Catholic faith never changes. But the language and mode of manifesting this one faith can change according to peoples, times and places.","Religion is one dimension of culture, a transcendent element of it.","With reference to other religions, the Church sees a great difference between them and herself. The other religions are expressions of the human soul seeking God, with some beautiful spiritual insights, but also not without errors. Christianity is rather God seeking humanity.","Remarkable is the greater openness of the Catholic Church towards people of other religious traditions and persuasions. The development has not been without problems, since some people have resisted it and others have pushed openness beyond the desirable point.","Vatican II declares the Church... as necessary for salvation.","There is no dogma that the organ or harmonium can be used in church, but not the drum.","Even among the married, sexual satisfaction must not be sought in a way which disregards man's character as a person and degrades him to the animal level.","There is a tendency around the world today to copy TV culture. And that is not always a virtue."],"Francis Asbury":["My soul is more at rest from the tempter when I am busily employed.","We should so work as if we were to be saved by our works; and so rely on Jesus Christ, as if we did no works."],"Francis Atterbury":["The greater absurdities are, the more strongly they evince the falsity of that supposition from whence they flow.","Affliction is a school of virtue; it corrects levity, and interrupts the confidence of sinning.","They who are not induced to believe and live as they ought by those discoveries which God hath made in Scriptures would stand out against any evidence whatever, even that of a messenger sent express from the other world."],"Francis Aungier":["The male sex still constitute in many ways the most obstinate vested interest one can find.","With a group of bankers I always had the feeling that success was measured by the extent one gave nothing away."],"Francis Bacon":["In order for the light to shine so brightly, the darkness must be present.","Silence is the sleep that nourishes wisdom.","It is impossible to love and to be wise.","Knowledge is power.","The job of the artist is always to deepen the mystery.","Age appears to be best in four things; old wood best to burn, old wine to drink, old friends to trust, and old authors to read.","The best part of beauty is that which no picture can express.","A bachelor's life is a fine breakfast, a flat lunch, and a miserable dinner.","Reading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man.","I will never be an old man. To me, old age is always 15 years older than I am.","A man that studieth revenge keeps his own wounds green.","If a man's wit be wandering, let him study the mathematics.","Truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.","Imagination was given to man to compensate him for what he is not; a sense of humor to console him for what he is.","A little philosophy inclineth man's mind to atheism, but depth in philosophy bringeth men's minds about to religion.","A wise man will make more opportunities than he finds.","Read not to contradict and confute, nor to believe and take for granted... but to weigh and consider.","Travel, in the younger sort, is a part of education; in the elder, a part of experience.","Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested.","Small amounts of philosophy lead to atheism, but larger amounts bring us back to God.","In taking revenge, a man is but even with his enemy; but in passing it over, he is superior.","Silence is the virtue of fools.","He that gives good advice, builds with one hand; he that gives good counsel and example, builds with both; but he that gives good admonition and bad example, builds with one hand and pulls down with the other.","Opportunity makes a thief.","If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts, but if he will content to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties.","Nature is often hidden, sometimes overcome, seldom extinguished.","Hope is a good breakfast, but it is a bad supper.","Fortitude is the marshal of thought, the armor of the will, and the fort of reason.","God Almighty first planted a garden. And indeed, it is the purest of human pleasures.","Wise men make more opportunities than they find.","Friends are thieves of time.","There is a difference between happiness and wisdom: he that thinks himself the happiest man is really so; but he that thinks himself the wisest is generally the greatest fool.","Science is but an image of the truth.","The worst men often give the best advice.","The root of all superstition is that men observe when a thing hits, but not when it misses.","If we do not maintain justice, justice will not maintain us.","Prosperity is not without many fears and distastes; adversity not without many comforts and hopes.","The worst solitude is to have no real friendships.","Beauty itself is but the sensible image of the Infinite.","Good fame is like fire; when you have kindled you may easily preserve it; but if you extinguish it, you will not easily kindle it again.","God has placed no limits to the exercise of the intellect he has given us, on this side of the grave.","The genius, wit, and the spirit of a nation are discovered by their proverbs.","Studies serve for delight, for ornaments, and for ability.","Nothing is pleasant that is not spiced with variety.","If a man be gracious and courteous to strangers, it shows he is a citizen of the world.","Nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed.","Judges ought to be more leaned than witty, more reverent than plausible, and more advised than confident. Above all things, integrity is their portion and proper virtue.","People usually think according to their inclinations, speak according to their learning and ingrained opinions, but generally act according to custom.","There is no excellent beauty that hath not some strangeness in the proportion.","A prudent question is one-half of wisdom.","God hangs the greatest weights upon the smallest wires.","Truth emerges more readily from error than from confusion.","We cannot command Nature except by obeying her.","Choose the life that is most useful, and habit will make it the most agreeable.","Whosoever is delighted in solitude is either a wild beast or a god.","Money is like manure, of very little use except it be spread.","They are ill discoverers that think there is no land, when they can see nothing but sea.","There is no comparison between that which is lost by not succeeding and that which is lost by not trying.","Acorns were good until bread was found.","Pictures and shapes are but secondary objects and please or displease only in the memory.","Natural abilities are like natural plants, that need pruning by study; and studies themselves do give forth directions too much at large, except they be bounded in by experience.","He that hath wife and children hath given hostages to fortune; for they are impediments to great enterprises, either of virtue or mischief.","The subtlety of nature is greater many times over than the subtlety of the senses and understanding.","But men must know, that in this theatre of man's life it is reserved only for God and angels to be lookers on.","It is in life as it is in ways, the shortest way is commonly the foulest, and surely the fairer way is not much about.","Who ever is out of patience is out of possession of their soul.","Friendship increases in visiting friends, but in visiting them seldom.","Judges must beware of hard constructions and strained inferences, for there is no worse torture than that of laws.","The way of fortune is like the milkyway in the sky; which is a number of small stars, not seen asunder, but giving light together: so it is a number of little and scarce discerned virtues, or rather faculties and customs, that make men fortunate.","Rebellions of the belly are the worst.","Houses are built to live in, and not to look on: therefore let use be preferred before uniformity.","The correlative to loving our neighbors as ourselves is hating ourselves as we hate our neighbors.","Truth is a good dog; but always beware of barking too close to the heels of an error, lest you get your brains kicked out.","He that will not apply new remedies must expect new evils; for time is the greatest innovator.","A man must make his opportunity, as oft as find it.","There is as much difference between the counsel that a friend giveth, and that a man giveth himself, as there is between the counsel of a friend and of a flatterer. For there is no such flatterer as is a man's self.","Wives are young men's mistresses, companions for middle age, and old men's nurses.","Riches are a good hand maiden, but a poor mistress.","The great end of life is not knowledge but action.","The remedy is worse than the disease.","Certainly the best works, and of greatest merit for the public, have proceeded from the unmarried, or childless men.","Of all virtues and dignities of the mind, goodness is the greatest, being the character of the Deity; and without it, man is a busy, mischievous, wretched thing.","He that hath knowledge spareth his words.","Seek ye first the good things of the mind, and the rest will either be supplied or its loss will not be felt.","Nothing doth more hurt in a state than that cunning men pass for wise.","I had rather believe all the Fables in the Legend, and the Talmud, and the Alcoran, than that this universal frame is without a Mind.","The place of justice is a hallowed place.","Next to religion, let your care be to promote justice.","Antiquities are history defaced, or some remnants of history which have casually escaped the shipwreck of time.","A sudden bold and unexpected question doth many times surprise a man and lay him open.","What is truth? said jesting Pilate; and would not stay for an answer.","Men fear death as children fear to go in the dark; and as that natural fear in children is increased by tales, so is the other.","By indignities men come to dignities.","Certainly, in taking revenge, a man is but even with his enemy, but in passing it over, he is superior; for it is a prince's part to pardon.","Anger is certainly a kind of baseness, as it appears well in the weakness of those subjects in whom it reigns: children, women, old folks, sick folks.","It is a true rule that love is ever rewarded, either with the reciproque or with an inward and secret contempt.","Prosperity is the blessing of the Old Testament; adversity is the blessing of the New.","No body can be healthful without exercise, neither natural body nor politic, and certainly, to a kingdom or estate, a just and honourable war is the true exercise.","Things alter for the worse spontaneously, if they be not altered for the better designedly.","Write down the thoughts of the moment. Those that come unsought for are commonly the most valuable.","When a man laughs at his troubles he loses a great many friends. They never forgive the loss of their prerogative.","Fashion is only the attempt to realize art in living forms and social intercourse.","The momentous thing in human life is the art of winning the soul to good or evil.","There is a wisdom in this beyond the rules of physic: a man's own observation what he finds good of and what he finds hurt of is the best physic to preserve health.","People have discovered that they can fool the devil; but they can't fool the neighbors.","Truth is so hard to tell, it sometimes needs fiction to make it plausible.","As the births of living creatures are at first ill-shapen, so are all innovations, which are the births of time.","Fame is like a river, that beareth up things light and swollen, and drowns things weighty and solid.","They that will not apply new remedies must expect new evils.","The pencil of the Holy Ghost hath labored more in describing the afflictions of Job than the felicities of Solomon.","God's first creature, which was light.","I do not believe that any man fears to be dead, but only the stroke of death.","It is as natural to die as to be born; and to a little infant, perhaps, the one is as painful as the other.","It is natural to die as to be born.","Discretion of speech is more than eloquence, and to speak agreeably to him with whom we deal is more than to speak in good words, or in good order.","For my name and memory I leave to men's charitable speeches, and to foreign nations and the next ages.","Fortune is like the market, where, many times, if you can stay a little, the price will fall.","This is certain, that a man that studieth revenge keeps his wounds green, which otherwise would heal and do well.","Therefore if a man look sharply and attentively, he shall see Fortune; for though she be blind, yet she is not invisible.","Knowledge and human power are synonymous.","Studies perfect nature and are perfected still by experience.","Lies are sufficient to breed opinion, and opinion brings on substance.","Life, an age to the miserable, and a moment to the happy.","Many a man's strength is in opposition, and when he faileth, he grows out of use.","The joys of parents are secret, and so are their grieves and fears.","Revenge is a kind of wild justice, which the more a man's nature runs to, the more ought law to weed it out.","Virtue is like a rich stone, best plain set.","The fortune which nobody sees makes a person happy and unenvied.","Young people are fitter to invent than to judge; fitter for execution than for counsel; and more fit for new projects than for settled business.","Anger makes dull men witty, but it keeps them poor.","We are much beholden to Machiavel and others, that write what men do, and not what they ought to do.","The desire of excessive power caused the angels to fall; the desire of knowledge caused men to fall.","Who questions much, shall learn much, and retain much.","Children sweeten labours, but they make misfortunes more bitter.","It is a strange desire, to seek power, and to lose liberty; or to seek power over others, and to lose power over a man's self.","It is as hard and severe a thing to be a true politician as to be truly moral.","There is nothing makes a man suspect much, more than to know little.","The quarrels and divisions about religion were evils unknown to the heathen. The reason was because the religion of the heathen consisted rather in rites and ceremonies than in any constant belief."],"Francis Beaumont":["Oh, love will make a dog howl in rhyme.","Kiss till the cow comes home.","Faith without works is like a bird without wings; though she may hop with her companions on earth, yet she will never fly with them to heaven.","Nothing's so dainty sweet as lovely melancholy.","There is a method in man's wickedness; it grows up by degrees.","It is more noble by silence to avoid an injury than by argument to overcome it.","Let no man fear to die, we love to sleep all, and death is but the sounder sleep.","The true way to gain much, is never to desire to gain too much.","Interest makes some people blind, and others quick-sighted.","Bad's the best of us.","But what is past my help is past my care.","You are no better than you should be.","Envy, like the worm, never runs but to the fairest fruit; like a cunning bloodhound, it singles out the fattest deer in the flock."],"Francis Biddle":["The Constitution has not greatly bothered any wartime President.","I'm for catching every Japanese in America, Alaska, and Hawai'i now and putting them in concentration camps."],"Francis Bond Head":["Although I had arrived in total darkness the light of truth at once burst upon my mind and I perceived most clearly that the republicans had overreached themselves.","Do you think Revolutions are made with rose water?","If you dispute with me you will only quarrel with your bread and butter."],"Francis Cabot Lowell":["One lifetime is never enough to accomplish one's horticultural goals.

'That's all you're going to give me? You're just going to give me enough to sustain me for today? What about tomorrow or next year or 10, 20, 30 years from now? I want to know that I'm set up.' And yet Jesus says just pray for your daily provisions.","For a person to be truly discipled and growing in their faith, they need more than one person discipling them.","Even in my own church I heard the words, 'Francis Chan' more than I heard the words, 'Holy Spirit.'","When you read the New Testament, you see the Holy Spirit was supposed to change everything so that this gathering of people who call themselves Christians had this supernatural element about them.","There are periods that we forget that in the pursuit of fruit, that if we just abide in Him, then fruitfulness is a guarantee.","A key to everything is surrender - to really come before the Lord and say, 'I will literally stay here as long as you want me to stay' or 'God, I will really go anywhere on the earth.'","One of my biggest fears - maybe my biggest weakness as a Christian - is that I have a hard time going up to a stranger and talking to them about Jesus.","Every year in my life, I trust fewer and fewer people.","Honestly, when I read the Scriptures, I really believe the Lord puts a heart in us when we become believers.","When I don't think biblically, I go nuts. I just go, 'This is crazy.'","I've never felt a need to really respond to someone else's writing.","As a culture, we're so worried about what's going to happen to us 30 years from now that we are not taking care of our brothers and sisters who need help today.","Our God listens to us. Our God is a living God. He's not a block of wood you made up that's not going to answer you. My God listens to me. He answers me.","I want the joy of knowing that I am doing something with my life, the joy of battle.","Due to our consumer mindset, people are prone to jump from church to church, which weakens the church overall.","Being around a church culture, even leading a gathering of believers, I've gotten pretty good at predicting what's going to happen in a church service.","It's easy to write for God and about God, because what a thrill to remind the church that the Holy Spirit of God is in you. What a rush! What an amazing blessing!","Churches we build only by our own efforts and not in the strength of the Spirit will quickly collapse when we don't push and prod people along.","Churchgoers in America are notorious for jumping into movements, even ideas that are hard to listen to. But when they actually have to change their lifestyle and do something about it, it rarely translates into action.","I could fill my whole time doing interviews, speaking to crowds, and there's this natural human tendency because of our culture to think that the more people I talk to, the bigger the impact I'll have, and yet Jesus didn't spend His time just speaking to the masses. He spent the bulk of his time with a small group of people.","There are just certain times I sense the Lord is wanting me to write, and so I write.","I want to help people understand how to study the Scriptures with other people, to give them an overview of Scripture and assume that by understanding the Scriptures better, the Holy Spirit will bring to mind the right stories, the right teachings.","Parents are supposed to instruct their kids. It doesn't mean they necessarily have that gift of teaching.","When I read the statements of Christ, there seems to be this urgency and intensity. I guess that's what I get out of it when I read the tone of the Scriptures, which is very different from the tone of our culture.","If I have a script, I tend to stick to it even if God may be leading me elsewhere in the moment.","With my natural communication abilities, I could probably gather a crowd even without the Spirit.","Our culture is all about shallow relationships. But that doesn't mean we should stop looking each other in the eye and having deep conversations.","I could be wrong about salvation. I could be wrong about a lot of things."],"Francis Collins":["I believe God did intend, in giving us intelligence, to give us the opportunity to investigate and appreciate the wonders of His creation. He is not threatened by our scientific adventures.","I'm a pretty informal guy. I ride a Harley.","For me, in my Christian belief, prayer is not an opportunity to manipulate God into doing what you want him to. Prayer is an opportunity to have a conversation with God to try to get in tune with what his will is.","I became an atheist because, as a graduate student studying quantum physics, life seemed to be reducible to second-order differential equations. Mathematics, chemistry and physics had it all. And I didn't see any need to go beyond that.","The shelves of many evangelicals are full of books that point out the flaws in evolution, discuss it only as a theory, and almost imply that there's a conspiracy here to avoid the fact that evolution is actually flawed. All of those books, unfortunately, are based upon conclusions that no reasonable biologist would now accept.","In my own experience as a physician, I have not seen a miraculous healing, and I don't expect to see one.","God gave us free will, and we may choose to exercise it in ways that end up hurting other people.","Faith is reason plus revelation, and the revelation part requires one to think with the spirit as well as with the mind. You have to hear the music, not just read the notes on the page.","The brain is the most complicated organ in the universe. We have learned a lot about other human organs. We know how the heart pumps and how the kidney does what it does. To a certain degree, we have read the letters of the human genome. But the brain has 100 billion neurons. Each one of those has about 10,000 connections.","One must dig deeply into opposing points of view in order to know whether your own position remains defensible. Iron sharpens iron.","Research is so unpredictable. There are periods when nothing works and all your experiments are a disaster and all your hypotheses are wrong.","I actually do not believe that there are any collisions between what I believe as a Christian, and what I know and have learned about as a scientist. I think there's a broad perception that that's the case, and that's what scares many scientists away from a serious consideration of faith.","A virus is not just DNA; a virus is also packaged up, covered over with a series of proteins in a nice, elegant, well-compacted form.","God is an awesome mathematician and physicist.","As a Christian, but also as a scientist responsible for overseeing the Human Genome Project, one of my concerns has been the limits on applications of our understanding of the genome. Should there be limits? I think there should. I think the public has expressed their concern about ways this information might be misused.","I'm enormously interested to see where neuroscience can take us in understanding these complexities of the human brain and how it works, but I do think there may be limits in terms of what science can tell us about what does good and evil mean anyway, and what are those concepts about?","Patenting tends to get people's juices flowing when you put the word 'gene' and the word 'patent' in the same sentence. And understandably so. This is stuff we're carrying around - all of us - inside all of our cells. Should somebody be able to lay claim to it?","Scientists must venture outside their comfort zones to show the public how cool - and how important - their work really is.","It's interesting when you read the life of Christ how much of his time he spent healing the sick. There must have been a reason for that - he was modelling for us what it is we are intended to do by following his path.","A cardinal principle that we must not stray from - no exceptions - is that your genetic information is your business in terms of who sees it. Nobody should be gaining access to that information without your explicit permission, and nobody should be requiring you to take a genetic test unless you decide that that's what you want to do.","I'm a serious Christian. I take my faith seriously. I try to practice it every day of the week, not just on Sunday.","If you are looking for a needle in a haystack, and somebody has already cataloged all the straw in the haystack, when you get to that needle you will recognize it's different than what was supposed to be there based on all that computerized haystack information that had been predetermined for you.","Nobody gets argued all the way into becoming a believer on the sheer basis of logic and reason. That requires a leap of faith.","When does life begin? When does the soul enter? That's a religious question. Science is not going to be able to help with that.","We give our kids vaccinations. That's a biological enhancement that's considered not just acceptable but actually admirable.","So much of what we are currently seeing as far as human suffering and misery comes from diseases that should have been preventable but were not.","Genes are effectively one-dimensional. If you write down the sequence of A, C, G and T, that's kind of what you need to know about that gene. But proteins are three-dimensional. They have to be because we are three-dimensional, and we're made of those proteins. Otherwise we'd all sort of be linear, unimaginably weird creatures.","I think history would say that medical research has, throughout many changes of parties, remained as one of the shining lights of bipartisan agreement, that people are concerned about health for themselves, for their families, for their constituents.","The word 'living' has so many connotations that I'm almost reluctant to try to define it scientifically because it sounds as if I'm then downgrading all the other significances of that word.","I'm always feeling like I'm lacking wisdom. This reassurance that one can ask God for that and it will happen is certainly reassuring to me.","Cancer is a disease of the genome. And that's what happens. You make mistakes in a cell somewhere in your body that causes it to start to grow when it should've stopped, and that's cancer. And those mistakes are mistakes of DNA.","As a scientist, you're not supposed to make decisions without the data.","Growing up, I was vaguely aware of things that went on in church, because I was in the boys' choir at the local Episcopal church. But I got the clear message that I was supposed to learn music there, and not pay too much attention to the rest of it, and I followed those instructions very carefully.","I finished up my graduate degree in quantum mechanics, but underwent a bit of a personal crisis, recognizing that I didn't want to do that for the rest of my life. It was too abstract, too far removed from human concerns.","If I'm walking down the riverbank, and a man is drowning, even if I don't know how to swim very well, I feel this urge that the right thing to do is to try to save that person. Evolution would tell me exactly the opposite: preserve your DNA. Who cares about the guy who's drowning?","For delightfully quirky descriptions of bizarre neurological syndromes that teach us a lot about how the brain works, there is no match for Oliver Sacks.","I trained initially as a physical chemist, and then, after becoming interested in biology, I went to medical school and learned how to be a physician. So, I'm a physician scientist.","My own area of expertise is the genetics of human disease. I was fortunate to be part of the team that found the genes for cystic fibrosis, and Huntington's disease and neurofibromatosis.","Science's domain is the natural. If you want to understand the natural world and be sure you're not misleading yourself, science is the way to do it.","If God is real, and I believe he is, then he is outside of nature. He is, therefore, not limited by the laws of nature in the way that we are.","I've never heard God speak out loud to me. That's not an experience I have had.","I don't have a problem with the concept that miracles might occasionally occur at moments of great significance, where there is a message being transmitted to us by God Almighty. But as a scientist, I set my standards for miracles very high.","What faith has not been used by demagogues as a club over somebody's head?","I believe in the literal rising of the body of Christ. It's the cornerstone of my Christian faith.","I think there are people who's lives have been saved because of the study of the genome.","A technological advance of a major sort almost always is overestimated in the short run for its consequences - and underestimated in the long run.","I'm aware there are certain products that are being advertised - food products - with 'no chemicals whatsoever.' Well, that would be pretty hard to arrange, since everything around us is made up of atoms and molecules - chemicals - including ourselves.","Sometimes you develop a passion for something because of some personal experience.","I took care of young adults with cystic fibrosis when I was in my residency training and found this to be a disease that was desperately in need of some explanation.","Proponents of intelligent design don't accept that some of the very complex nanomachines that we have inside ourselves could have come about solely on the basis of natural selection.","If you are in support of in vitro fertilization, then you have to recognize that human embryos are being created in excess of what can be used safely to reimplant for a pregnancy. So they're going to end up being discarded.","It is interesting that the U.S. has this very strong proportion of the population that rejects scientific conclusions about the age of the Earth and about evolutionary relationships between species, including humans.","The best diet is the one that can be sustained over the long term, combined with other healthful lifestyle behaviors.","Successful weight management really means a permanent change in lifestyle - and success in this arena provides that person with a great opportunity to model that behavior for friends and family.","Many people struggle with losing weight and then regaining it. But there is no convincing evidence that the effort to lose weight actually promotes more weight gain in the long run.","People who are in a position of finding out that they're at risk for some illness, whether it's breast cancer, or heart disease, are afraid to get that information - even though it might be useful to them - because of fears that they'll lose their health insurance or their job."],"Francis Crick":["It now seems very likely that many of the 64 triplets, possibly most of them, may code one amino acid or another, and that in general several distinct triplets may code one amino acid.","The balance of evidence both from the cell-free system and from the study of mutation, suggests that this does not occur at random, and that triplets coding the same amino acid may well be rather similar.","It is one of the more striking generalizations of biochemistry - which surprisingly is hardly ever mentioned in the biochemical textbooks - that the twenty amino acids and the four bases, are, with minor reservations, the same throughout Nature.","We've discovered the secret of life.","Unfortunately it makes the unambiguous determination of triplets by these methods much more difficult than would be the case if there were only one triplet for each amino acid.","This seems highly likely, especially as it has been shown that in several systems mutations affecting the same amino acid are extremely near together on the genetic map.","We are sometimes asked what the result would be if we put four +'s in one gene. To answer this my colleagues have recently put together not merely four but six +'s.","Moreover the incorporation requires the same components needed for protein synthesis, and is inhibited by the same inhibitors. Thus the system is most unlikely to be a complete artefact and is very probably closely related to genuine protein synthesis.","It would appear that the number of nonsense triplets is rather low, since we only occasionally come across them. However this conclusion is less secure than our other deductions about the general nature of the genetic code.","It seems likely that most if not all the genetic information in any organism is carried by nucleic acid - usually by DNA, although certain small viruses use RNA as their genetic material.","It now seems certain that the amino acid sequence of any protein is determined by the sequence of bases in some region of a particular nucleic acid molecule.","It has yet to be shown by direct biochemical methods, as opposed to the indirect genetic evidence mentioned earlier, that the code is indeed a triplet code.","If, for example, all the codons are triplets, then in addition to the correct reading of the message, there are two incorrect readings which we shall obtain if we do not start the grouping into sets of three at the right place.","If the code does indeed have some logical foundation then it is legitimate to consider all the evidence, both good and bad, in any attempt to deduce it.","If poly A is added to poly U, to form a double or triple helix, the combination is inactive.","The meaning of this observation is unclear, but it raises the unfortunate possibility of ambiguous triplets; that is, triplets which may code more than one amino acid. However one would certainly expect such triplets to be in a minority.","How is the base sequence, divided into codons? There is nothing in the backbone of the nucleic acid, which is perfectly regular, to show us how to group the bases into codons.","For simplicity one can think of the + class as having one extra base at some point or other in the genetic message and the - class as having one too few.","Do codons overlap? In other words, as we read along the genetic message do we find a base which is a member of two or more codons? It now seems fairly certain that codons do not overlap.","Attempts have been made from a study of the changes produced by mutation to obtain the relative order of the bases within various triplets, but my own view is that these are premature until there is more extensive and more reliable data on the composition of the triplets.","A final proof of our ideas can only be obtained by detailed studies on the alterations produced in the amino acid sequence of a protein by mutations of the type discussed here.","A comparison between the triplets tentatively deduced by these methods with the changes in amino acid sequence produced by mutation shows a fair measure of agreement."],"Francis Darwin":["In science, the credit goes to the man who convinces the world, not to whom the idea first occurs.","There seems to be one quality of mind which seems to be of special and extreme advantage in leading him to make discoveries. It was the power of never letting exceptions go unnoticed."],"Francis Drake":["There must be a beginning of any great matter, but the continuing unto the end until it be thoroughly finished yields the true glory."],"Francis Ford Coppola":["I think cinema, movies, and magic have always been closely associated. The very earliest people who made film were magicians.","I like simplicity; I don't need luxury.","The essence of cinema is editing. It's the combination of what can be extraordinary images of people during emotional moments, or images in a general sense, put together in a kind of alchemy.","If you're a person who says yes most of the time, you'll find yourself in the hotel business and the restaurant business.","Anyone who's made film and knows about the cinema has a lifelong love affair with the experience. You never stop learning about film.","My film is not a movie; it's not about Vietnam. It is Vietnam.","I think it's better to be overly ambitious and fail than to be underambitious and succeed in a mundane way. I have been very fortunate. I failed upward in my life!","That's part of the requirement for me to be an artist is that you're trying to share your personal existence with others and trying to illuminate modern life, trying to understand life.","Films and hotels have many aspects that are the same. For example, there is always a big vision, an idea.","You have to really be courageous about your instincts and your ideas. Otherwise you'll just knuckle under, and things that might have been memorable will be lost.","The whole reason one wants to do lower budget films is because the lower the budget, the bigger the ideas, the bigger the themes, the more interesting the art.","I was always the black sheep of the family and always told that I was dumb, and I had a low IQ and did badly in school.","I have more of a vivid imagination than I have talent. I cook up ideas. It's just a characteristic.","I just admire people like Woody Allen, who every year writes an original screenplay. It's astonishing. I always wished that I could do that.","When a movie is about to come out on its initial debut, there are a lot of people involved - the financiers, the studio and the producers and also, many times, the foreign distributors. So it is a time of tremendous pressure and uncertainty.","By working in the morning, I find a sense of peace; it's isolated peace, but I can definitely be in touch with my feelings, and then I just start.","Steven Spielberg is unique. I feel that the kinds of movies he loves are the same kinds of movies that the big mass audience loves. He's very fortunate because he can do the things he naturally likes the best, and he's been very successful.","When I was 13, I worked for Western Union. When the telegrams came in, I would glue them on the paper and deliver them on my bicycle.","Art depends on luck and talent.","I like to work in the morning. I like to sometimes go to a place where I'm all alone where I'm not going to get a phone call early that hurts my feelings, because once my feelings are hurt, I'm dead in the water.","Anything you build on a large scale or with intense passion invites chaos.","I believe that filmmaking - as, probably, is everything - is a game you should play with all your cards, and all your dice, and whatever else you've got. So, each time I make a movie, I give it everything I have. I think everyone should, and I think everyone should do everything they do that way.","It's ironic that at age 32, at probably the greatest moment of my career, with The Godfather having such an enormous success, I wasn't even aware of it, because I was somewhere else under the deadline again.","The most adventurous thing I've done is learn how to fly a helicopter in the Philippines. One night we landed on a beach and slept on it.","I bring to my life a certain amount of mess.","When I was going for my graduate degree, I decided I was going to make a feature film as my thesis. That's what I was famous for-that I had my thesis film be a feature film, which was 'You're a Big Boy Now.'","It is a little disappointing to see that your legs are not as strong. But I like the idea of growing old, and the thought of approaching death is not particularly daunting to me.","Ten Days That Shook The World, by Eisenstein, I went to see it, and I was so impressed with this film, so impressed with what cinema could do.","I don't think there's any artist of any value who doesn't doubt what they're doing.","Most Italians who came to this country are very patriotic. There was this exciting possibility that if you worked real hard, and you loved something, you could become successful.","Lots of people have criticized my movies, but nobody has ever identified the real problem: I'm a sloppy filmmaker.","You're in a profession in which absolutely everybody is telling you their opinion, which is different. That's one of the reasons George Lucas never directed again.","I remember teachers who really singled me out for their discouragement.","I liked to work in a shop down in the basement and invent things and build gadgets.","I had an older brother who was very interested in literature, so I had an early exposure to literature, and and theater. My father sometimes would work in musical comedies.","I probably have genius. But no talent.","When that happens - when risk is taken and the filmmakers dive into the subject matter without a parachute - very often what you get it something with those qualities that make it age well with the public.","I think a sequel is a waste of money and time. I think movies should illuminate new stories.","Without a doubt, I was born to want to make cinema, but the kind of cinema I want to make is not like commercial movies, which I enjoy myself, but I wanted to be the kind of filmmaker who wrote original work, sort of like a novelist would who deals with who we are and our times or our relationships.","We had access to too much money, too much equipment, and little by little, we went insane.","I had a heartbreaking experience when I was 9. I always wanted to be a guard. The most wonderful girl in the world was a guard. When I got polio and then went back to school, they made me a guard. A teacher took away my guard button.","When I was sixteen or seventeen, I wanted to be a writer. I wanted to be a playwright. But everything I wrote, I thought, was weak. And I can remember falling asleep in tears because I had no talent the way I wanted to have.","You ought to love what you're doing because, especially in a movie, over time you really will start to hate it.","The professional world was much more unpleasant than I thought. I was always wishing I could get back that enthusiasm I had when I was doing shows at college.","I was the kind of kid that had some talents or ability, but it never came out in school.","All of a sudden, there are great Japanese films, or great Italian films, or great Australian films. It's usually because there are a number of people that cross-pollinated each other.","We do things for good reasons that are bad.","'The Godfather' changed my life, for better or worse. It definitely made me have an older man's film career when I was 29.","I gladly, I voluntarily gave up the kind of commercial film career I had going as soon as I had enough money to finance my own films.","I was a pretty shy, lonely kid. I blossomed about age 17, when I went to college.","I wrote the script of Patton. I had this very bizarre opening where he stands up in front of an American flag and gives this speech. Ultimately, I was fired. When the script was done, they hired another writer and that script was forgotten.","I was raised as a Catholic, but I didn't like the Catholic Church at all. I thought the nuns were mean.","If I have to be remembered for something, I want it remembered that I really liked children and was a good camp counselor.","Usually, the stuff that's your best idea or work is going to be attacked the most.","They needed someone to write a script of The Great Gatsby very quickly for the movie they were making. I took this job so I'd be sure to have some dough to support my family.","In kindergarten that used to be my job, to tell them fairytales. I liked Hans Christian Andersen, and the Grimm fairy tales, all the classic fairy tales.","I thought I wanted to be a playwright because I was interested in stories and telling stories.","Listen, if there's one sure-fire rule that I have learned in this business, it's that I don't know anything about human nature.","I wanted to write and direct movies and not be forced to adapt them from a bestselling book.","It takes no imagination to live within your means.","Most filmmakers can't afford to try something out that doesn't work.","I was never sloppy with other people's money. Only my own. Because I figure, well, you can be.","I had to get a job, and of course, the job was 'The Godfather.' That made me be something I didn't know I was going to be. I became a big-shot director.","Everything I do is personal. I have never made a movie that didn't have very strong personal resonance.","I never went to a psychologist or psychiatrist in my life. Never. You know, Italians are a little prejudiced against that kind of thing.","We were raised in an Italian-American household, although we didn't speak Italian in the house. We were very proud of being Italian, and had Italian music, ate Italian food.","When I was about 9, I had polio, and people were very frightened for their children, so you tended to be isolated. I was paralyzed for a while, so I watched television.","When I do a novel, I don't really use the script, I use the book; when I did Apocalypse Now, I used Heart of Darkness. Novels usually have so much rich material.","The stuff that I got in trouble for, the casting for The Godfather or the flag scene in Patton, was the stuff that was remembered, and was considered the good work.","Roger Corman exploited all of the young people who worked for him, but he really gave you responsibility and opportunity. So it was kind of a fair deal.","I remember growing up with television, from the time it was just a test pattern, with maybe a little bit of programming once in a while.","I landed a job with Roger Corman. The job was to write the English dialogue for a Russian science fiction picture. I didn't speak any Russian. He didn't care whether I could understand what they were saying; he wanted me to make up dialogue.","I had been a kid that moved so much, I didn't have a lot of friends. Theater really represented camaraderie.","I had a number of very strong personalities in my family. My father was a concert flutist, the solo flute for Toscanini.","I had a number of teachers who hated me. I didn't do well in school.","I became quite successful very young, and it was mainly because I was so enthusiastic and I just worked so hard at it.","I associate my motion picture career more with being unhappy and scared, or being under the gun, than with anything pleasant.","I always found the film world unpleasant. It's all about the schedule, and never really flew for me.","George Lucas doesn't have the most physical stamina. He was so unhappy making Star Wars that he just vowed he'd never do it again.","Frank Capra was a prop man, I think. John Ford was a prop man. It was a little bit of a father and son thing, and you kind of worked your way up.","A number of images put together a certain way become something quite above and beyond what any of them are individually.","In a sense, I think a movie is really a little like a question and when you make it, that's when you get the answer.","When newspapers started to publish the box office scores of movies, I was horrified. Those results are totally fake because they never include the promotion budget.","As long as I can make lots of money in other businesses, I'll continue to subsidize my own work.","I realized I probably wouldn't make another film that cuts through commercial and creative things like 'Godfather' or 'Apocalypse.'","The internet in hotels should be free - and I really resent it when they charge you five dollars for a bottle of water beside your bed.","I used to love going into local hardware stores, to look at little things they made locally. Nowadays it's harder, though you can still do it in Vietnam.","I'm no longer dependent on the movie business to make a living. So if I want to make movies as other old guys would play golf, I can.","I've been offered lots of movies. There's always some actor who's doing a project and would like to have me do it. But you look at the project and think, 'Gee, there are a lot of good directors who could do that.' I'd like to do something only I can do.","People feel the worst film I made was 'Jack.' But to this day, when I get checks from old movies I've made, 'Jack' is one of the biggest ones. No one knows that. If people hate the movie, they hate the movie. I just wanted to work with Robin Williams.","My big goal in life was always to figure out how I can make a lot of money so I can go off and make films irrespective of the opinion of the three or four critics who seem to rule the roost.","'Godfather' was very classical - the way it was shot, the style - the whole driving force of it was more classical, almost Shakespearean.","Being a former theater student, of course, there is a part of me that is fascinated with stage crafts and what you can do with illusions and working within the confines of the studio.","We support each other in the Coppola family. We love the idea of everyone getting his place in the sun.","I don't go on set with an army of people because the most expensive elements of a movie production are the plane tickets, the hotel rooms, food and gasoline. If you're willing to discover new colleagues in the place that you are, you can save a ton of money.","I was terrible at maths, but I could grasp science, and I used to love to read about the lives of the scientists. I wanted to be a scientist or an inventor.","Movie-wise, there is nothing I wouldn't do again. It's not possible to make one perfect movie every time.","I've been offered lots of movies. There's always some actor who's doing a project and would like to have me do it.","Sequels are not done for the audience or cinema or the filmmakers. It's for the distributor. The film becomes a brand.","The only TV I would be interested in exploring would be live television. There's no substitute for a team of artists performing at their peak live when failure is possible. It's a high-wire act. That excites me.","I have much to learn from my daughter Sofia. Her minimalism exposes my limitations: I'm too instinctive and operatic, I put too much heart into my work, I get lost sometimes in bizarre things - it's my Italian heritage.","I've been blessed with enough wealth that I can make a film myself up to a certain budget. So one way I thought I would reinvent myself was just to make these very small, personal films that I've financed myself.","My company and people think I'm wacky when I have an idea... I know if I have an idea, no one will want to go through it. But if I persist, people will go through it.","I wanted to be a film student again, as a man in my 60s. To go someplace alone and see what you can cook up, with non-existent budgets. I didn't want to be surrounded by comforts and colleagues, which you have when when you're a big time director. I wanted to write personal works.","My family were symphonic musicians and in the opera. Also, it was my era, the love of radio. We used to listen to the radio at night, close our eyes and see movies far more beautiful than you can photograph.","Sound is your friend because sound is much cheaper than picture, but it has equal effect on the audience - in some ways, perhaps more effect because it does it in a very indirect way.","To make great movies, there is an element of risk. You have to say, 'Well, I am going to make this film, and it is not really a sure thing.'","The time a movie is made is unique, not only from the talent that is available but if the public was ready for it.","I live near San Francisco in the most beautiful spot on earth and enjoy myself in many ways. Yes, I love to work, which for now is to think and read and write, so it's all a dream come true.","I know that if a film is ready to emerge out of what I write, I'll be able to go off and make it without asking anyone's permission.","Some critics are stimulating in that they make you realise how you could do better, and those are valued."],"Francis Fukuyama":["The rationale for tenure is still valid. But the system has turned the academy into one of the most conservative and costly institutions in the country. Yes, conservative: Economists joke that their discipline advances one funeral at a time, but many fields must wait for wholesale generational turnover before new approaches take hold.","In general, Americans are not very good at nation-building and not very good colonialists.","I'm basically an optimist because I do think there's this historical modernisation process, and by and large it's been very beneficial to people. But there are blips. History doesn't proceed in a linear way.","I've always had a Marxist understanding of history: democracy is a result of a broad modernization process that happens in every country. Neocons think the use of political power can force the pace of change, but ultimately it depends on societies doing it themselves.","I've figured out in the course of my life that the one thing I'm good at doing is writing books, and it would be crazy to trade that in for something else.","I'm a tenured professor. But I'd get rid of tenure."],"Francis G. Slay":["I plan to see St. Louis as a global competitor. As an international trade hub, as an incubator of new companies, as a place of culture and the arts, as a magnet for immigrants, for entrepreneurs, for animal lovers, and for gays, as a city of parks and trails, and as the sort of place that figures in young people's dreams.","Violence is not a constitutionally protected right.

And it's stressful as it is, and I think that most of us got in this business because it's fun to make movies.","I think the movie business and film crews are a little bit like the circus, in that we travel around like a pack and we're a big family for a finite period of time. We roll into someplace, cause a bunch of damage, and then roll out.","I wish that the circuses that were around now felt like they did then. They're not quite as elegant or as magical as they used to be. There was something about the old tent shows, the Big Top, the canvas, the lights, the sawdust, the hay and the animals that's just missing now. Now, it's all urbanized and maybe a little garish.","Whenever you're adapting something that's a 12- or 14-hour read down to something that has to be around two hours, there's going to be some cuts.","I think that the thing that is really strong with 'The Hunger Games' is just that it comes from a very strong idea.","There are two separate scripts for 'Mockingjay' parts one and two. It's definitely one story, but there are two totally distinct and separate scripts.","I've been a fan of noir films since I was in high school.","One of the big themes - if not the big theme - of 'Mockingjay - Part 1' is the battle of the airwaves. I don't think teenagers really understand the role propaganda has in our lives in terms of politics, advertising, and the general manipulation of imagery.","'I Am Legend' was a rich, emotional experience where you could be scared and cry, and there's some wish fulfilment.","I love animals. Even if you go back to my music video days, I can't tell you how many animals I used.","When you're making a movie, you have those days that you really look forward to, and it's a little bit like Murphy's law. The days you look forward to become your hell days. The days you're dreading become these amazing days.","I've never seen a 'Transporter' movie.","Often, adults don't give kids enough credit.","All the 'Hunger Games' stuff, we had a fantastic production designer, and he built amazing sets.","I love reluctant heroes, all of that.","I never... it's a hard thing: when I think about projects, I don't come off something and go, 'I really want to make a sci-fi film next,' or 'I really want to do a political thriller next.' It's really coming across - I'm really fascinated, partly by world building, but also about the character and what the journey is.","It's kind of the filmmaker's job to use visual, cinematic language in a way possible to tell a story that reaches and touches as many people as possible.","I always want to try to make films feel timeless, because one of my biggest pet peeves is that there's a movie you love, and then you revisit it twenty years later, you show your kid or something, and it's like, 'Oh my God!' with hairstyles and clothing and all that kind of stuff.","We actually started shooting the 'Mockingjay' movies before 'Catching Fire' was released.","I'm attracted to the journeys of isolated characters.","I still wear Vans.","I remember 'Battlestar Galactica' shot at the college that my dad taught at. I remember trying on a Cylon helmet. I think I was 6 or 7 years old.","When I signed on and went and did 'Catching Fire,' the majority of it was done in Atlanta for rebate reasons. Luckily, that worked because there's forest. There's old rail stations and factories and lots of stuff we can use and sound stages. For the tropical stuff, we went to Hawaii.","I've now made enough movies that I understand that people love to put things in a box.","'Last Man on Earth'... Vincent Price is one of my favorite actors; I think he was miscast.","'Omega Man' is a little too tied to a specific generation and a little cult-y to me."],"Francis Lee":["You don't have to be popular with the players to be a good manager or coach.","I'm dumbfounded, but nothing surprises me in this game.","Manchester was a fantastic place to go out in.

Obviously the average age is 60 something, but they all have children and grandchildren, they understand what we need to do, they want to win.","If we do what we think is right, not try to point-score, people will begin to trust us.","But if we can work with people in other parties to get the right answer for the country we'll do that.","They don't think we're in touch with modern Britain, or understand modern Britain or like modern Britain.","The party at its best has always been a modern party.","It is simply the view, and a view I think shared by most members of the party, that it is very difficult to have a leader that does not command the support of the parliamentary party.","The problem we have is not Labour, in however it is configured.","So our problem is not Labour, it is us, is making us attractive enough to gain disillusioned Labour support and to compete effectively with the Lib Dems for those loose votes.","We need to show that we know and understand and can reflect today's Britain. Today we don't.","Our share of the vote overall rose by less than 1 per cent - yes, that's right: less than 1 per cent.","We should be the natural home for the millions of Britons of immigrant origin.

It is not a formative force, but always and only a disintegrating force.","If pessimism is despair, optimism is cowardice and stupidity. Is there any need to choose between them?","Politics is activity in relation to power.","Alliance does not mean love, any more than war means hate.","The purest expression of the doctrine of Liberalism was probably that of Benjamin Constant.","Rationalism, which is the feeling that everything is subject to and completely explicable by Reason, consequently rejects everything not visible and calculable.","Liberalism can only be defined negatively. It is a mere critique, not a living idea.","The early American arrived at a land of which he knew nothing.","Liberalism is a most important by-product of Rationalism, and its origins and ideology must be clearly shown.","The independence of the economic sphere was a tenet of faith with Liberalism.","To an intellectual who is adrift in politics, a theory is an aim; to a true politician his theory is a boundary.","A political theory seeks to find from history the limits of the politically possible.","To the fantastic mental illness of Rationalism, hard facts are regrettable things, and to talk about them is to create them.","The way politics divides the world is into friend and enemy.","Hatred is not contained in political thinking. Any hatred worked up against the public enemy is non-political, and always shows some weakness in the internal political situation.","No section of the American populace has been more completely deceived by the forces interested in keeping the truth from the people than America's youth.","Leftist ideas are a part of the very atmosphere which American youth breathes.","Man as a pure animal does not exist.","Pessimism only describes an attitude, and not facts, and hence is entirely subjective.","As a world view, Darwinism cannot of course be refuted, since Faith is, always has been, and always will be, stronger than facts.","Every science is a profane restatement of the preceding dogmas of the religious period."],"Francis Parkman":["We were soon free of the woods and bushes, and fairly upon the broad prairie.","Not a breath of air stirred over the free and open prairie; the clouds were like light piles of cotton; and where the blue sky was visible, it wore a hazy and languid aspect.","It was a rich and gorgeous sunset - an American sunset; and the ruddy glow of the sky was reflected from some extensive pools of water among the shadowy copses in the meadow below.","Here society is reduced to its original elements, the whole fabric of art and conventionality is struck rudely to pieces, and men find themselves suddenly brought back to the wants and resources of their original natures.","Fort Leavenworth is in fact no fort, being without defensive works, except two block-houses.","A few hours' ride brought us to the banks of the river Kansas.","A military road led from this point to Fort Leavenworth, and for many miles the farms and cabins of the Delawares were scattered at short intervals on either hand.","America, when it became known to Europeans, was, as it had long been, a scene of wide-spread revolution.","Crossing the Penobscot, one found a visible descent in the scale of humanity.","Early on the next morning we reached Kansas, about five hundred miles from the mouth of the Missouri.","Four men are missing; R., Sorel and two emigrants.

I hope, I pray not to lose it. My fingers are crossed. Also my heart.","Christians are as subject to complacency as anybody else, and we can certainly settle into repetition and forget that something radical and extraordinary is being asked of us as well - that we hold to an extraordinary promise about how, from moment to moment, something enters the world and enters us, after which everything is different.","I am a fairly orthodox Christian. Every Sunday, I say and do my best to mean the whole of the Creed, which is a series of propositions. But it is still a mistake to suppose that it is assent to the propositions that makes you a believer. It is the feelings that are primary.","Despite the best efforts of apologists like William Lane Craig, the 'evidence' for Christianity's truth is, in truth, not the kind that science will or should ever admit. We believers mean something different by the word: something that puts faith permanently in the category of irreproducible results.","For a believer, Christian faith is true to the human heart, not in the sense that any old thing we fancy believing in will become conveniently true - but because the complicated truth about our hearts, as we struggle to perceive it, tells us what we are and where we are, and consequently what we need.","Belief demands that you dispense with illusion after illusion, while contemporary common sense requires continual, fluffy pretending - pretending that might as well be systematic, it's so thoroughly incentivised by our culture.","If you based your knowledge of the human species exclusively on adverts, you'd think that the normal condition of humanity was to be a good-looking single person between 20 and 35, with excellent muscle-definition and/or an excellent figure, and a large disposable income.","The emotions that sustain religious belief are all, in fact, deeply ordinary and deeply recognisable to anybody who has ever made their way across the common ground of human experience as an adult.","I was never argued out of faith; it was much more passive than that - and I wasn't argued back in, either.","There have been low moments before, but Christianity is an incredibly adaptable organism, using different parts of its repertoire to mutate into new ecological niches, yet preserving intact its story of grace, of love improbably triumphant.","In a hundred years, Christianity will have mutated into something utterly unpredictable which, nevertheless, we'd recognize immediately. And same-sex marriage will be one of the fine old God-given traditions that conservatives leap to defend.","What we need in Europe is to push back against the idea that religion is so farfetched that it's not worth talking about.","Christianity is a religion of continuity and discontinuity as well. It's about what stays the same and what changes in the twinkling of an eye. Both are necessary truths, but sometimes it's important to accentuate the discontinuity, the sudden leap, the way you go up a tree, Zacchaeus, and come down a saint.","Emotions can certainly be misleading: they can fool you into believing stuff that is definitely, demonstrably untrue. Yet emotions are also our indispensable tool for navigating, for feeling our way through, the much larger domain of stuff that isn't susceptible to proof or disproof, that isn't checkable against the physical universe.","It's true that when Christianity is socially powerful, faith can look from the outside as if it is mainly a matter of membership, of participation in the vast synchronised swim of institutions.","Self-awareness is not the same thing as self-approval, any more than imagination is the same thing as day-dreaming.","Libraries are public treasuries. They're ways in which well-meaning societies leave the wealth of the past arranged A to Z so that anyone walking past can find it.","Anyone can be self-educated if they find the loose end of something to care about passionately.","You don't have to become an investment banker as a way of demonstrating that education has worked for you. But librarians have to believe in the values of high culture. Not just high culture but middle culture, low culture, kinds of exciting eye-catching crap of all kinds.

From selfishness. Because this state of liquefied, complex concentration, however faintly and dimly I'm able to perceive it, is the greatest pleasure I know.","If you're a believer, God is not a thought-experiment requiring a special sub-creation to be tried out in.

Newman":["God has two families of children on this earth, the once-born and the twice-born.","The active part of man consists of powerful instincts, some of which are gentle and continuous; others violent and short; some baser, some nobler, and all necessary.","I first began to read religious books at school, and especially the Bible, when I was eleven years old; and almost immediately commenced a habit of secret prayer.","As to the war, while it is always thought rash to have any strong military convictions, I have always believed that if they would go straight to Sebastopol early in the season they would take it with little difficulty."],"Francis Walsingham":["I call God to witness that as a private person I have done nothing unbeseeming an honest man, nor, as I bear the place of a public man, have I done anything unworthy of my place.","See and keep silent.","Knowledge is never too dear.","There is less danger in fearing too much than too little.","There is nothing more dangerous than security."],"Francis William Aston":["It has long been known that the chemical atomic weight of hydrogen was greater than one-quarter of that of helium, but so long as fractional weights were general there was no particular need to explain this fact, nor could any definite conclusions be drawn from it.","The whole of the hydrogen on the earth might be transformed at once and the success of the experiment published at large to the universe as a new star.","The cosmical importance of this conclusion is profound and the possibilities it opens for the future very remarkable, greater in fact than any suggested before by science in the whole history of the human race."],"Francis of Assisi":["Start by doing what's necessary; then do what's possible; and suddenly you are doing the impossible.","Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love.","Where there is charity and wisdom, there is neither fear nor ignorance.","A single sunbeam is enough to drive away many shadows.","Above all the grace and the gifts that Christ gives to his beloved is that of overcoming self.","It is no use walking anywhere to preach unless our walking is our preaching.","For it is in giving that we receive.","Men lose all the material things they leave behind them in this world, but they carry with them the reward of their charity and the alms they give. For these, they will receive from the Lord the reward and recompense they deserve.","It is not fitting, when one is in God's service, to have a gloomy face or a chilling look.","It is in pardoning that we are pardoned.","Praised be You, my Lord, with all Your creatures, especially Sir Brother Sun, Who is the day through whom You give us light. And he is beautiful and radiant with great splendour; of You, Most High, he bears the likeness.","Lord, grant that I might not so much seek to be loved as to love.","We must not be wise and prudent according to the flesh. Rather, we must be simple, humble and pure.","Praised be You, my Lord, through Sister Moon and the stars; in the heavens, you have made them bright, precious and fair.","Praised be You, my Lord, through our Sister, Mother Earth, who sustains and governs us, producing varied fruits with coloured flowers and herbs.","If God can work through me, he can work through anyone.","If you have men who will exclude any of God's creatures from the shelter of compassion and pity, you will have men who will deal likewise with their fellow men.","While you are proclaiming peace with your lips, be careful to have it even more fully in your heart.","Where there is injury let me sow pardon.","Great and glorious God, and Thou Lord Jesus, I pray you shed abroad your light in the darkness of my mind. Be found of me, Lord, so that in all things I may act only in accordance with Thy holy will.","Pure, holy simplicity confounds all the wisdom of this world and the wisdom of the flesh.","The Father willed that his blessed and glorious Son, whom he gave to us and who was born for us, should through his own blood offer himself as a sacrificial victim on the altar of the cross. This was to be done not for himself through whom all things were made, but for our sins.","Woe to those who die in mortal sin!","No one is to be called an enemy, all are your benefactors, and no one does you harm. You have no enemy except yourselves.","We should never desire to be over others. Instead, we ought to be servants who are submissive to every human being for God's sake.","Praised be You, my Lord, through Brother Fire, through whom You light the night, and he is beautiful and playful and robust and strong.","I am the herald of the Great King.","Holy wisdom confounds Satan and all his wickednesses.","Holy charity confounds all diabolical and fleshly temptations and all fleshly fears.","Grant me the treasure of sublime poverty: permit the distinctive sign of our order to be that it does not possess anything of its own beneath the sun, for the glory of your name, and that it have no other patrimony than begging.","Holy poverty confounds cupidity and avarice and the cares of this world.","If a superior give any order to one who is under him which is against that man's conscience, although he do not obey it yet he shall not be dismissed.","Holy humility confounds pride and all the men of this world and all things that are in the world."],"Francisco Costa":["Brazil is not what you see but what you feel. Once you spend time here - a week, two weeks - you get in the vibe. It's really intoxicating.","When a sketch comes into this three-dimensional form and everybody contributes, it's really fantastic.","Milan, for me, is a city of discovery. You can find some amazing gardens behind some great houses; I also love finding beautiful galleries and incredible shops, but you have to explore. And the food is amazing.","I never liked sleeping; I always think I am missing something.","All the Tauruses I know have this connection to the earth and the environment. We are very curious people, very loyal, very aware of and respectful of our surroundings. Also, we're stubborn, but that's our way. We understand what we want, which is not bad.","I hope the average woman feels she needs practicality but with a little bit of fantasy. Otherwise, it's just not fashion.","Each season I strive to design a forward-thinking and effortless collection with a very clean minimalist aesthetic.","I hate to sound esoteric, but there is something about a house that leads you to that one chair, that one corner, where you just sit and feel comfortable.","I drape a lot. I cut. I have to touch. For me, it's almost impossible to start without that.","I get so much inspiration from my travels, but I also started an exercise where I write down so many words every week. Then I begin crossing them off. We create a grid of words and also images, but words for me are more ample because you can interpret them your own way.","My parents had a factory, so I was linked to the textile and fashion industry.","I do go back to Brazil once a year. I miss my family.","I don't love reading so much, but I love book shopping.","Right after high school, I moved to Rio and took classes to become a technician for a manufacturing factory where you had to figure out how to produce 3,000 pairs of jeans. But in Rio, I was by myself, which was very liberating, being so young. I got to do my own thing.","I wonder if I would have been less organic of a designer without my background. Maybe I would be more academic about designing, more methodical. I want things to be a certain way, and I'm very precise, but school itself wasn't that relevant for me.","My mom, she was unbelievable. She ran the whole town. She was like the mayor. There would be 15 people eating at our lunch table. She'd drag people from the street.","I came to New York when I was 21, 22. I couldn't speak English. I knew I wanted to go to fashion school.","I wanted to be involved with fashion, though I didn't know what being a designer meant.","I'm not an artist. I'm a fashion designer of clothes.","I just hate people who are lazy. To be on my team, you have to have energy and a sense of wanting to learn. That really excites me.","I have no tolerance for boredom. I spend so many hours in the office, and I still love it.","I don't listen to music when designing. We create in silence. I go through a torturous process because everything has to be precise and right.","People don't really go to museums in Rio. I shouldn't say it's not sophisticated, but, you know, they go to the beach.","Rio was a period of my life, and then, poof, I'm gone. I was very young living here, just kind of floating. New York was a foundation for everything I do today. Rio was the bridge.","When people ask me what it is about Brazil and my work, it's not something that I can say literally. It's unidentifiable. It's like when you do research and things inspire you. If you're smart enough, then obviously you don't take it literally. The inspiration will come out later somehow.","I cannot live without art: it excites me, it challenges me, and it leads me to the next thing.","I think the women that we dress, the women who buy our clothes, they have a certain strength. It could be about the clothes, it could be about themselves. It's just attractive.","When I say art influences me, which it does, it's not at all in a literal form. You go and see exhibitions or collections or meet an artist. It's all a compilation. Every moment, at all times, all this information. Then all this information disappears, and it shows up later in the process.","I'm so not interested in gossip. It just gives me the creeps. I love the work; I love what I do. If somebody sends me an interview that has any connotation of something that's not interesting or genuine, I'm not interested. I really detach myself from it.","The bottom line is that red carpet helps us broaden the appeal of the brand. Calvin Klein used to be about a very specific woman, but we've dressed so many different women at awards.","I'm inspired by many things, from landscapes to textiles. Art and architecture always influence my design process.","My love of fashion stemmed from my mother's passion for it.","I love to garden and cook whenever I get the chance and escape anywhere that's peaceful and quiet. My philosophy on living well is to always stay positive in life.","If you have beautiful knees, show your knees. I'm not a puritan. I love skin.","My mother was very fashion-oriented, and she started a little children's wear business that became large in this little town. She used to be able to look at a picture of an outfit and just start cutting the fabric right there.","I came to New York in 1986. My father didn't think it was a good idea. I didn't know how I found it, but I went to Hunter College. I had no money and I couldn't speak English.","You think 24-7 when you're a creative person. And I find pleasure in everything - if I'm in a flea market, I'm there on my downtime, but I'm also there searching for the collection. I don't separate the two."],"Francisco Franco":["There will be no communism.","The whole secret of the campaigns unleashed against Spain can be explained in two words: masonry and communism... we have to extirpate these two evils from our land.","I am responsible only to God and history."],"Francisco Goldman":["When I see a blatant injustice, I can't keep quiet. I've been that way since I was a little kid.","I have never liked the memoir form because I tend to think that memory fictionalizes anyway. Once you claim that you are writing a narrative purely from memory, you are already in the realm of fiction.","What's important about me is that I really have, in ways I never could have foreseen when I was young, a writing career that's reached a lot of different places.","'Say Her Name' was a book I never wanted to write and never expected to write. I wasn't trying to do anything except write a book for Aura - a book that I thought I had to write.","I think the fact that my wife died in Mexico City makes it very important to me; my life went up in smoke at that moment, the family and the future we were going to have. At that point, I was anchored to the city in a way I've never been anchored to a place before.","My earliest memories of going to Fenway with my father are a blur: many games, me too young to care, but aware that our team 'stunk.' In those years, the 1960s, the Red Sox baseball card I always coveted most was not Carl Yastrzemski's but the far more ordinary Felix Mantilla's.","The U.S., like any other country, allows tourists into its borders in order to make money off them, and there's nothing wrong with that. Why give out tourist visas if you're not going to let tourists be tourists?","You witness a lot as a journalist, and what you witness becomes a part of you.","In U.S. discourse, immigrants are mostly represented as less than human, a policy problem, or as just that, a category, and categories are prisons.","My only way of processing anything for me is by writing.","I had one of those farcical bar mitzvahs where they spell out the words phonetically on index cards, and you don't even know what you're saying.","I identify myself as what I am. I'm half Jewish, like Proust. I have no other way to put it."],"Francisco Goya":["In art, there is no need for color; I see only light and shade. Give me a crayon, and I will paint your portrait.","I am beginning to have more powerful enemies and more envious ones, too.","I have just returned from Arenas and feel very tired. His Excellency loaded me with a thousand honours; I have painted his portrait and that of his wife and boy and girl with unexpected success, for other artists had been there previously and not been successful.","Fantasy, abandoned by reason, produces impossible monsters; united with it, she is the mother of the arts and the origin of marvels.","I will give a proof to demonstrate with facts that there are no rules in painting and that oppression or servile obligation of making all study or follow the same path is a great impediment for the young who profess this very difficult art.","Painting (like poetry) chooses from universals what is most apposite. It brings together, in a single imaginary being, circumstances and characteristics which occur in nature in many different persons.","With all my work, I have not more, with my shares in the bank and the Academy, than twelve or thirteen thousand reales a year, and with all this, I am as contented as the happiest man on earth.","I have now established myself in a most enviable manner. Those who require something of me must seek me out - I remain apart. I work for no one unless he is a high-ranking personality or a friend."],"Francisco Javier Gomez Noya":["I enjoy an easy jog. In the mountains, or the forest with my own thoughts, I can escape from the world for a bit.","It's weird because before a race, I always want something sweet, like a cake, but afterwards, I crave something salty, like pizza.","When I have an easy run, I like to listen to music and relax. When I have to train hard, I try to simulate race conditions, and in a race, you can't listen to music.","Usually I'll have fruit with breakfast, but not on the day of the race, as sometimes it's difficult to digest. When racing Olympic distance, I'll have my last meal three hours before the race, and during the race I'll have a gel. I think it's enough.","My aortic valve was a bit different than normal, and some doctors thought I shouldn't do triathlons.","I have to have routine check-ups every three to six months. While the cardiologists think I can compete, there is no problem. I didn't consider quitting. Once the cardiologists said I could run, I decided to fight.","Although I come from the world of swimming... my strong point is the running race, and it is the one I enjoy the most. It's where I have had a slight edge over my rivals.","It's an error to count on winning a medal in the triathlon. With one race every four years, anything can happen, especially in a sport as tactical as this where it isn't always the strongest who wins."],"Francisco de Quevedo":["In short, not only are things not what they seem, they are not even what they are called!","We all wish to reach a ripe old age, but none of us are prepared to admit that we are already there."],"Franco Harris":["And, coaching has never been an option for me.","All I wanted to be was a player.","Halfway through the decade, we realized that we had a great team and that we could do great things, and that we could probably have something here that we believed we had a chance to reach greatness.","After 12 years, the old butterflies came back. Well, I guess at my age you call them moths.","It's not how you come out of the starting blocks.","But, as always, Mr. Rooney would come over and shake your hand and congratulate you on a good game, no matter what the situation was.","The Houston Astrodome was kind of a tough field.","Where Joe was more vocal and emotional whereas Chuck was very reserved. But, both of them executed great strategy and both of them demanded a lot of their players.","Yes, I would have rather finished up in Pittsburgh.","I really don't look at comparing things that way because even in a 14-game season, there could be a running back who could have a lot more carries than other running backs.","And so, it's not a thing of how many carries, but were you effective when you did carry.","Jack Lambert is mean and relentless wherever he goes, on and off the field! I do remember many times he would chase me in practice but no way would I let him catch me."],"Franco Modigliani":["Economists agree about economics - and that's a science - and they disagree about economic policy because that's a value judgment... I've had profound disagreements on policy with the famous Milton Friedman. But, on economics, we agree.","I am a believer in cooperation.","People confuse economists and economic policy.","With the danger of war, there is a danger that the economy will go down.","The immediate effect of the deficit is to make you feel good, like when you go on a trip and pay later. You feel good, and then you get a hangover. The deficit makes you feel good - until you pay later."],"Franco Moschino":["I don't say I create. I copy, of course. I've never been interested in the point of view of the tailor or creator. Fashion is a visual impression. This is why I often refuse the name of fashion designer. It's a superficial, stupid job. The social-psychological aspect is more interesting.","The reason I do this job is because I started to be a painter. Making money in art was difficult. The easiest way to make money was to use art for some other reason. One of the easiest and most interesting from an economic point of view was fashion. Fashion pays.","Good taste doesn't exist. It is our taste. We have to be proud of it.","I was in love with Lagerfeld's designs."],"Franco Nero":["You're the one who likes cigars right? Try smoking this.","Left love behind many years ago. Now it rests under a cross in the cemetery in Tombstone.","It doesn't matter. What matters is that you're about to die.","Every western I did and will do; I will do it for the never ending young kid inside of me.","Someone who was a part of my life. Probably the only one that really mattered.","I'm crazy about westerns. I need to do a western once in a while. It's like you know, eating bread, eating pasta, drinking wine. It's in my blood. I need it.","If you're a big Hollywood star, you make one movie a year at the most. I can make five in Europe.","I could be a star and maybe make lots of money, or I could change roles all the time and have a more interesting - and longer - career.","Everyone has a first love, and mine was the western. When I was a child and dreamed of the movies, it was always as a cowboy on a white horse.","I studied at the Piccolo Teatro di Milano; I was a theatre actor.","There were many, many other 'Django' films following mine, with other actors and directors, but there is only one 'Django.'"],"Francois Arnaud":["I'm not sure I'll find acting satisfying creatively forever. If you get the good roles, it's great - if you have the freedom to choose your projects and not just do anything and everything.","I watched 'E.T.' when I was a kid every day. Well, not all of it every day; I'd pause it and start over again. But I've watched 'E.T.' about 400 times in my life.","The first play that I saw was 'Cyrano,' and I remember going home - I was like nine years old - and trying to learn the monologues.","I didn't act professionally before going to drama school. I don't know if I had the confidence. I didn't think I'd get in when I first auditioned for drama school, and then I did.","I just go wherever work brings me. I share a house with friends in L.A., and I share a house with friends in Montreal when I'm there.","I think there comes a point in probably most father-son relationships where the son kind of starts becoming the parent.","Today, the Pope is only a religious figure. At the time of 'The Borgias,' he was also a political leader, a financial leader, and the head of an army. I think popes are much less relevant today than they were then.","As an actor, as much as I'm interested in how you make movies and TV shows, even as a kid, I've always hated making of featurettes and special features on DVDs. I think it breaks the spell.","I started studying theater in school, and then I got into drama school at, like, 19, and it was a national drama school in Montreal, and so it was just you and nine other students for three years, and it was really intense."],"Francois Cluzet":["What's interesting for me is that I generally consider myself to be more of a physical actor, and I'm somebody that doesn't really want to use the dialogue but prefers to act through my body, and then sometimes when I have a script, I look and kind of throw away the dialogue and I just look at how I can expressive it through my body.","I think there's a kind of love relationship between an actor and an audience, and this is something I really feel with the audiences in France.","I think that in France, we really admire American films, we admire their drive, we admire the modernity and ellipsism in the film and the writing and the style of acting, and we look at them perhaps in a way to see what we can steal from them, too, to make our own films more modern.","I'm an actor who isn't fond of dialogue and who loves to act silently."],"Francois Englert":["My parents emigrated from Poland in 1924 with my brother, who was a few months old. They were from a simple family of Polish Jews. They were looking, I suppose, for a better economic life and were escaping from an anti-Semitic environment.","Gravitational and electromagnetic interactions are long-range interactions, meaning they act on objects no matter how far they are separated from each other.","I was born in Belgium on 6 November 1932. I am married to Mira Nikomarow and have five children: Michele, Anne, Georges, from a first marriage with Esther Dujardin, and Sarah, Helene from a second one with Danielle Vindal.","In 1955, I got my degree in electrical-mechanical engineering. I realised, however, that my interest was less in practical applications than in the understanding of the underlying theoretical structure, and I decided to learn physics.","As an assistant in the polytechnic department, I was able to finance new studies and got my Physics Masters Degree in 1958 and my Ph.D. in 1959.","It's not necessary to have read everything about a particular subject in order to get interested in it. The main thing is to sort out what's important and what is peripheral in order to be able to dive in.","I feel squeezed like a lemon - interviewers and people keep turning up unannounced at my office!","Fundamental research is needed to make progress, which you cannot do solely by copying others. If you only do applied research, you quickly lose creativity.","The curiosity of the human mind is essential if you want citizens who think rather than accept the first nonsense they come to.","I like to call it the scalar boson because this reflects an essential component of the theory - it means that the field the boson travels through has no preferred direction, unlike the way a magnetic field does."],"Francois Fenelon":["Do not make best friends with a melancholy sad soul. They always are heavily loaded, and you must bear half.","All earthly delights are sweeter in expectation than in enjoyment; but all spiritual pleasures more in fruition than in expectation.","Children are excellent observers, and will often perceive your slightest defects. In general, those who govern children, forgive nothing in them, but everything in themselves.","Exactness and neatness in moderation is a virtue, but carried to extremes narrows the mind.","Nothing is more despicable than a professional talker who uses his words as a quack uses his remedies.","All wars are civil wars, because all men are brothers.","There is a set of religious, or rather moral, writings which teach that virtue is the certain road to happiness, and vice to misery in this world. A very wholesome and comfortable doctrine, and to which we have but one objection, namely, that it is not true.","Little opportunities should be improved.","If we were faultless we should not be so much annoyed by the defects of those with whom we associate.","Had we not faults of our own, we should take less pleasure in complaining of others.","A good historian is timeless; although he is a patriot, he will never flatter his country in any respect.","Genuine good taste consists in saying much in few words, in choosing among our thoughts, in having order and arrangement in what we say, and in speaking with composure."],"Francois Fillon":["Great Britain is not part of the euro-zone; but the decision we take will have great importance for Great Britain.","We need to put in place an economic system of governance for the euro-zone.","In order to consolidate the euro we need to harmonise our economic, fiscal and social policies, hence we are going toward greater integration.","The Europeans must now honor their commitments. That is the position that France is defending.","France does not practice revenge."],"Francois Gautier":["The West remains obsessed by the caste system.","I was born in Paris in 1950. I had a strict upper-class Catholic education but I never really fitted in the system and revolted against it quite early.","I started writing and photographing for different publications and finally ended up being the correspondent in South Asia, for the Geneva-based Journal de Geneve, which at one time used to be one of the best international newspapers in Europe.","I have no intention of going back to France, except for yearly visits to meet my family.","I have an interest in spirituality, and it opens up so many different areas of Indian life.","Being married to a daughter of India is a natural complement of my being in this country for 30 years. My roots are very much in this country, even though I remain a Westerner."],"Francois Hollande":["We have chased away the clouds, the sky is all 'rose.'","When I took part in European leaders summits, it was sometimes unpleasant for me to hear Romanian, Polish, Portuguese, and Italian friends speak English, although I admit that on an informal basis, first contacts can be made in this language. Nevertheless, I will defend everywhere the use of the French language.","My policies are producing results and will produce even more.","I can't separate the fight with terrorism and the fight against global warming. These are two big global challenges we have to face up to because we have to leave our children more than a world free of terror; we also owe them a planet protected from catastrophes.","In an election, one needs both hope and audacity.","Though Africa is not responsible for emitting greenhouse gases, it is suffering the consequences of climate change.","People are tired of constant movement, improvisation, and wild scrambling when plans fail.","I want the French people to respect values that allow each individual to practice his or her faith, but in the frame of our common rules of secularism.","What the French want is coherence, stability and justice. If I am in a favorable position today, it's because my fellow citizens want to make the effort to straighten out the country, and at the same time they want it to be just and equitable.","Being in the European Union has its advantages, and I think that is what the British are beginning to understand, what those who are tempted by the Brexit are going to reflect upon.","When I travel officially... and when I travel on a private basis, I have protection that is less suffocating. But I am protected everywhere.","I could have made a fortune in cheeseburgers, but I finally chose politics.","I am attached to the French language. I will defend the ubiquitous use of French.","I am proud to have been capable of giving people hope again.","Europe needs an engine, and the Franco-German motor has provided that when the two nations have converged on important topics during critical periods. But that partnership shouldn't be a directorate for other EU members.","I don't like indecent, unearned wealth. But it is legitimate for an entrepreneur who has created something to make a good living.","I have defended the interests of France at the G8 in Washington; afterwards I was at Chicago to announce the withdrawal of French troops from Afghanistan; I have participated in two European summits, so I have fully respected the engagements I made to the French.","The Republic will destroy terrorism.","We want the United Kingdom to remain in the European Union.","Faced with terror, France must be strong, it must be great, and the state authorities must be firm.","My real adversary has no name, no face, no party. It will never be elected, yet it governs - the adversary is the world of finance.","Nothing was given to me, nothing was entrusted to me, nothing was assigned to me. Everything I have, I took by right.","I don't want to drive the markets crazy. I don't want to create trouble, but rather order and rules and norms. We have to struggle against financial excesses, those who speculate with sovereign debt, those who develop financial products which have done so much harm.","My obligation, if I become president, is to give another direction to Europe than the one that is being forced upon us today.","There's always a risk when the candidate becomes president: Will he deliver what is expected of him?","I am the president of the youth of France.","There is just one France... one single nation, united in the same destiny.","The British have been particularly shy about the issues of financial regulation, and attentive only to the interests of the City - hence their reluctance to see the introduction of a tax on financial transactions and tax harmonisation in Europe.","I want to initiate a change in society in the long term.","Before you, I engage myself to serve my country with the devotion and the exemplary that this post demands. I understand responsibilities of the job and, as such, I give a republican salute to Nicolas Sarkozy who has led France for 5 years and who deserves all of our respect.","Austerity need not be Europe's fate.","That is now my mission: to provide a European vision of growth, employment, prosperity - in one word, our future.","Is France a northern European export powerhouse, or a Mediterranean indebted and dependent economy? Yes to both.","I gave myself an objective, to be the second president from Correze and finally to be the successor to Francois Mitterrand.","France, after the month of May, will share trust with the current leadership of the United States which, on many subjects, has tended to take useful positions in our view.","Nicolas Sarkozy said he could see a wave rising. For once he was right. The wave's coming; it's high, its strong, and it's going to smack him in the face.","I won't wait until the end of my term to say I made mistakes at the beginning. That's too late. I will try to adopt the proper behaviour, if the French give me the chance, right from the start.","As a president I will be like the candidate that I am, a respectful candidate, a rallying candidate, a normal candidate for a normal presidency, at the service of the Republic.","Each country has a soul, and France's soul is equality.","My dear citizens, fellow citizens, French people, this 6th of May, have just chosen change by bringing me the presidency of the French republic. I feel the honor, which has been given to me and the task, the important task faced beyond - in front of you to serve my country.","I commit myself to serve my country.","I'm going to gather all the French people who want change.","We are near, very near, to an end to the eurozone crisis... The worst - in the sense of the fear of the eurozone breaking up - is over. But the best isn't there yet.","We're all taking part in this solidarity. The French, the Germans, just like all the Europeans in the ESM. Let's stop thinking that there's only one country who's going to pay for the others. That's false.","I would like a UK fully engaged in Europe, but I can't decide in place of the British. I see that for the moment they want to be more in retreat.","France is the bridge between northern Europe and southern Europe. I refuse any division. If Europe has been reunified, it's not for it to then fall into egotism or 'each for one's own'. Our duty is to set common rules around the principles of responsibility and solidarity.","Between France and Senegal there's a history. There's a language that we both speak. There's a culture that we share and to which both of our peoples have contributed. But beyond our history, beyond our language, beyond the links that have united us for so long, what unites us today is the future.","What is happening in the Sahel for the past several months is that terrorists have structured themselves, have installed themselves. It's not simply a menace for west Africa.","An education program is, by definition, a societal program. Work should be done at school, rather than at home.","Everyone says Francois Mitterrand had huge charisma. But before he was president they used to call him badly dressed, old, archaic and say he knew nothing about the economy... until the day he was elected. It's called universal suffrage. When you're elected, you become the person that embodies France.","My adversary is the world of finance.","We find ourselves in a difficult situation in Europe. There's a crisis, weak growth, unemployment... my duty is to ensure that by the end of my mandate France is in a better state than it was at the beginning.","During a term in office there are highs and lows, but what counts is that the goal is set as well as the means to achieve it, and the force we put into getting results.","France isn't just any country in Europe, and its president is not an ordinary leader in the world. Sometimes directing or leading the way is not enough, he has to initiate policies, as Nicolas Sarkozy was able to demonstrate during his term.","I perfectly understood President Obama's attitude throughout the French presidential campaign. He had no reason to distance himself from Nicolas Sarkozy. It's the basic solidarity that leaders who worked together owe to each other.","One thing that makes France different from other countries is the tradition of social solidarity. People from all backgrounds and political positions are willing to contribute for services and protection of society as a whole - but on the condition that money is being spent effectively and that everyone is paying their part.","We need the help of other member countries and leaders who, like us, want to see a change in Europe's direction. That's also my logic when I tell voters that electing me president will not only shape France's future, but also initiate change across all of Europe.","My goal is to put France back on its feet. I have to put this country back on its feet.","I don't want to leave my successor and my children to pay for France's debt.","We are a big country, with lots of advantages and history. We are proud to be French. We have to call on patriotism at this time... to ask for an effort in the battle against debt.","I know where I'm going and I have told the French. I am sure if hope is there, we will be able to put France back on its feet... to live better in five years than we do today.","I think that France has not made it clear enough recently to our German friends how important it is to introduce euro bonds as a tool against speculation. And how the necessary budget discipline needs to be accompanied by growth.","I don't want euro bonds that serve to mutualize the entire debt of the countries in the euro zone. That can only work in the longer-term. I want euro bonds to be used to finance targeted investments in future-oriented growth projects. It isn't the same thing. Let's call them 'project bonds' instead of euro bonds.","If I become president, France will not continue with the same policies as under Nicolas Sarkozy - both in domestic policy and in foreign and European policy.","Not in the constitution, but I would propose a law to the French parliament that provides for reducing the budget deficit year by year, until we have reached a balanced budget by 2017.","I am for a clear distinction between public and private life. I believe private matters should be regulated in private and I have asked those close to me to respect this.","My mission is to put France back on its feet. The priority is employment. Efforts have to be made, but those efforts must be made fairly.","I attach the greatest importance to an amplification of the peace efforts in the Middle East. I would also like to see a greater dialogue between the U.S. and the EU.","The transatlantic relationship is vital for both our countries: France will remain a reliable ally of the United States. Nevertheless, ally does not mean aligned.","The United Nations will be at the heart of our international activities. France will assume its full responsibilities at the Security Council by putting its status at the service of peace, respect for human rights and development.","To be influential in tomorrow's world, to defend our values and our development model, France needs Europe and Europe needs France.","The British people have decided to leave. It is a sad decision but one which I respect. The vote puts the European Union in difficulties. It must recognise its shortfalls.","A jolt is necessary. Europe must reaffirm it values of freedom, solidarity, peace. The EU must be understood and controlled by its citizens. I will do everything to secure profound change rather than decline.","Doesn't everyone have their hair done?","I do not like the rich.","Sport allows people to come together, but politics divides people.","I support the French team - I go to all their matches - but I don't want to use sport for politics. That's not good for sport or for politics.","The arguments in the Brexit vote and in the American presidential campaign are about the same. In a friendly way, may I also give some advice to the American people to make the right choice when the moment comes.","France, because it was attacked cowardly, shamelessly, violently, France will be merciless against the barbarians of Daesh.","I bow down in memory of the victims, and I come to tell my Armenian friends that we will never forget the tragedies that your people has endured.","France is no longer herself when she is folded in on herself, tormented by ignorance and intolerance. The country would plunge into decline if it refused to be itself, if it was afraid of the future, afraid of the world.","The world owes an ecological debt to the African continent.","It is intolerable that in our country citizens should feel so upset and under assault because of their religious choice that they would conclude that they have to hide.","Transatlantic links are very important.","The Republic will not be destroyed by terrorism.","Europe existed before Britain joined it.","I hope Britain stays in the European Union, but I don't want to decide for the British.","I can understand countries don't want to join the euro, but they cannot impede the consolidation and strengthening of the eurozone.","If Europe does not advance, it will fall or even be wiped out from the world map... My duty is to bring Europe out of its lethargy.","A country outside the euro zone cannot have a veto over countries in the euro zone.","Muslims in France should be able to practice their religion freely and safely.","I've got a thick skin.","I don't know if you can hear me, but I have heard you. I heard your willingness to change. Your force, your hope... and I want to tell you how grateful I am. Thank you, thank you, thank you, people of France.","Be happy, be proud, be generous, be respectful, be proud to be French citizens.","Everyone must understand that you can't demand solidarity when there's a problem and shirk your duties when there are solutions.","France wants Britain to remain in the E.U.; indeed, how can we imagine that friendly nation that is our ally and played a role on the international stage could be outside the E.U.?","If the discussion centres on the essential principle of the E.U., the free movement of people and the ability to make decisions together, in that case, we don't want treaty change.","If there is not a united policy, this mechanism will not work: it will collapse, and it will... undoubtedly be the end of Schengen, the return of national borders.","I will not give way because too many previous governments have backed down.","I prefer that people remember me as a president who made reforms rather than a president who did nothing.","I ask to be judged on the issue of unemployment.","A compromise appears out of reach on the stripping of terrorists' nationality.","Islamist terrorism has declared war against us, against France, Europe, the entire world.","France needs to improve training and education and the level of skills of its workforce.","The real threat comes from terrorism.","When we live longer, we must work a little bit longer.","It's not for Germany to decide for the rest of Europe.","My security is assured everywhere, and at any moment.","Everyone must be in the same competitive situation, including on the fiscal level.","China... has the capacity to ensure its stability and growth.","The extremists wanted to divide France; it came together.","There cannot be any concessions on the matter of human rights or the criteria for visa liberalisation.","There must be protection of the external borders.","To resolve the climate crisis, good will, statements of intent are not enough. We are at breaking point.","Our enemy in Syria is Daesh: it's not about containing but destroying this organisation.","ISIL struck France because it is 'free' and 'the nation of human rights'. This is not a war of civilisation, as these assassins don't have any. This is a war against the jihadist menace that threatens not just France.","Daesh is the enemy of Europe, and Europe cannot live with the idea that the crises that surround it don't have an effect on it.","The migrant question is directly linked to the crisis in Syria and Iraq.","The fight against global warming is a humanitarian issue - how the planet can be preserved - and it is also an issue of considerable economic importance, of what we call green growth.","Very strong declarations were made by those countries who are most responsible for global warming... the United States and China, which undertook commitments towards changing the situation.","Make no mistake: we will win, and groups like ISIL will lose.","Europe must be understood and controlled by its citizens.","Europe must act quickly where it's needed and must, once and for all, let member states handle what is their exclusive domain.","I noticed that parts of the opposition have been hostile to any revision of the constitution.","There must be pressure on Moscow so that we have negotiations. Moscow will not succeed by unilaterally backing Bashar al-Assad.","We must do everything to ensure that the Euro 2016 is a success.","France has been struck on the day of her national holiday - the 14th of July, Bastille Day - the symbol of liberty, because human rights are denied by fanatics, and France is clearly their target.","We will continue to hit those who threaten us.","Calling into question the Touquet deal on the pretext that Britain has voted for Brexit and will have to start negotiations to leave the union doesn't make sense.","We must not lose time, neither for dealing in a suitable way with the question of the United Kingdom's exit, nor for providing a new impetus for the E.U.","The concept of the terrorists is to plunge our country into division.","We are absolutely clear: when these unaccompanied minors have a family link in the United Kingdom, then they must go to the United Kingdom. And they must go quickly and in an efficient fashion.","What the terrorists want is to scare us and fill us with dread.","Long live the Republic, and long live France.","Things are going better: there is more growth, less deficit, more competitiveness, better margins for companies, more purchasing power for workers.","Our biggest threat is not too much Europe, but too little.","Our common responsibility is to put Europe's interests first.","Whoever pays should control; whoever pays should sanction. I agree. But budgetary union should be completed by a partial mutualisation of debts through eurobonds.","The best thing the Democrats can do is to get Hillary Clinton elected.","Whatever happened during the French presidential campaign will leave no hard feelings. I perfectly understand why Angela Merkel supported Nicolas Sarkozy because of the action they have taken together, even though I have questioned its results, and because of their shared political sensibility.","As much as I believe in the Franco-German partnership, I question the idea of a duopoly. European construction is based on a well-balanced and respectful partnership between France and Germany.","The partnerships between Schmidt and Giscard, Kohl and Mitterrand, and even between Chirac and Schroeder, have proved that political differences do not mean that we cannot work together.","I am not deaf. I hear the anger. I see the dissatisfaction, and I have to go faster.","We need intelligence services to fight against terrorism, but they have to respect the principles of good relationships between allies and protect personal, confidential data.","The first time that I went to the United States was in 1974. I was 20 years old. America was in crisis.","Our only goal is to strengthen the opposition and to avoid the dilemma whereby we only have the choice between Bashar Assad and al-Qaeda.","In August 2012, the international community should have been far more determined in dealing with the Bashar Assad regime.","I must demonstrate I'm closer to people - a simpler, calmer presence, yet someone who can also make decisions and obtain promised results.","People need to see signs of equal treatment across society.","Private life is always, at certain times, a challenge.","In my own situation, I cannot show anything... And I believe that everybody now understands that, president or not president, one is entitled to have a private life. But of course when one is president, this creates duties and obligations."],"Francois Hougaard":["It's never nice to lose someone close to you; unfortunately, life goes on, and we have to make peace with it and move on.","I think rugby is 80 per cent mental.","As soon as you have an average game, everyone is quick to criticise and say, 'You suck; you shouldn't be playing rugby.'","You never know what battles people fight."],"Francois Jacob":["For me, this world of questions and the provisional, this chase after an answer that was always put off to the next day, all that was euphoric. I lived in the future.","I had turned my anxiety into my profession.","Evolution is a tinkerer.","One of the deepest functions of a living organisms is to look ahead... to produce future."],"Francois Lelord":["Eros is not tranquil - it gives us spikes of happiness rather than a constant feeling of wellbeing. It's the love we feel at the beginning of a love affair and corresponds to the expression 'falling in love' since it is as involuntary an impulse as a physical fall.","I didn't intend 'Hector' to be a self-help book when I first started writing. I wrote it as a little tale about a psychiatrist, like me, who sets off around the world in order to discover the vital ingredients for happiness.","Finding love is a fixation now, and that's because although romantic love can sometimes cause a lot of suffering, it can also give people peaks of happiness that come very close to our ideal of 'the happy state.'","Very different from eros is philia, a serene love much more akin to friendship, with its reciprocal kindnesses. You love each other for the happy experiences and pleasures you share."],"Francois Mauriac":["Tell me what you read and I'll tell you who you are is true enough, but I'd know you better if you told me what you reread.","To love someone is to see a miracle invisible to others.","Where does discipline end? Where does cruelty begin? Somewhere between these, thousands of children inhabit a voiceless hell.","Human love is often but the encounter of two weaknesses.","I love Germany so dearly that I hope there will always be two of them.","Men resemble great deserted palaces: the owner occupies only a few rooms and has closed-off wings where he never ventures."],"Francois Mitterrand":["A man loses contact with reality if he is not surrounded by his books.","France is delighted at this new opportunity to show the world that when one has the will one can succeed in joining peoples who have been brought close by history."],"Francois Nars":["Makeup is about balance. When the eye makes a statement, the lips should be quiet.","It's very refreshing to go away and take a break, to clear your head, and just get into something else.","Makeup can make a woman look more beautiful at every age.","Women have to find their own personality, their own style, and what suits them the best.","I like beauty to be a bit edgy, not typical. For me, the only rule is looking good.","I think there was a freedom in the 1920s and 1930s: a certain liberty and evolution of women.","A fresh face with a red lip is timeless. It's supermodern and relaxed but very chic.","We are not afraid to be a bit different, to make shades that are bold.","Looking at flowers, simple things in life. I don't need to look at gold and a castle; sometimes its very simple things that are very beautiful. I am keeping my eyes fresh to find beauty in many places, and in gold, too, sometimes!","I've always loved the way movie stars in the Forties looked when they were off set. Shot poolside or at their home, they always wore a matte red lipstick with practically no foundation - it was how they wore makeup in real life.","You can look glamorous even if you're a housewife, any job you have.","In this world, you do your job, a good job, and that's what counts.","My mother and my two grandmothers, I was lucky to have three women around me growing up that were very special, very elegant women, very beautiful women. They were my first step into the beauty world, let's say, and then the fashion world, of course.","A woman who hides behind a mask of makeup is still going to have to take it off at some point... and deal with reality.","Wearing colourful eyeliner in a graphic shape is the epitome of make-up as an accessory.","I was spoiled growing up in the 1970s because magazines were publishing the photographs of Helmut Newton and Guy Bourdin without compromise. You really felt that sense of freedom through their images.","True icons are larger than life, unforgettable with an elegance that's mesmerizingly timeless.","Find your own way, have an open spirit, and believe in your own beauty.","My mother never wore much make-up, and she was a kind of natural beauty; she knew just how to enhance what she had.","I think less is more when it comes to make-up; this really helps achieve a lighter complexion. Heavy make-up creates a canvas and can dull the skin.","I'm very nostalgic - and I don't care.","Sometimes people are very not sure of themselves, so you really have to give them that confidence. Even models - they need to warm up sometimes on photo shoots.","You are born with this love; fashion and beauty are a part of who I am.","I thought make-up was a very sensual thing.","I have always been attracted to faces that are different.","My interpretation of the word 'ugly'... I like ugly beauty. That can happen. In France, we have phrase 'jolie laide.' We like certain women who are not pretty or cute - it's the opposite in France of pretty. It's more strange and interesting.","I think it's important that you know every detail when you open a store, that you pay attention to everything.","I think if you take good care of your skin, you can achieve better make-up.","You create the color first, and then the name that fits. It depends - there are no rules. You watch a fabulous old movie, and you suddenly get inspired by it to create a lipstick shade, or you walk through a gorgeous garden and find the most beautiful flower shade for an eye shadow, and then you name it.","My vision was to create makeup that was more transparent but with formulas that last. I follow my instincts - it's all very spontaneous!","It was never in my mind to be famous.","We don't tell women how to look but give them the products and inspiration they need to feel and look beautiful.","I'll keep creating modern, deep, rich and adventurous colors and products that inspire creative expression every day.","Transparency is more sexy than a full, pancake finish.","I love the architecture magazines and all of the French magazines for decoration or whatever. I end up enjoying them more sometimes than the fashion magazines.","I loved working with Avedon.","I like shocking, but I don't like to shock as an automatic process. Sometimes it happens, but it's not my main drive.","I think everyone deserves to look better and to look good.","I was a very lucky child because at the age of 16, 17 years old, my parents would buy me clothes from Yves Saint Laurent, which was an incredible luxury at the time, but I was attracted to that whole world. I had a pretty nice little wardrobe by the age of 17.","I really wanted to have a different approach of beauty because when I came to America, they were still heavily, heavily plastic. The ads were so heavily retouched.","My goal was always to make the girl look real and look beautiful. It didn't matter how much makeup. Sometimes it was none at all.","I always had a vision about beauty in general, so probably that's what really drove me into that direction of creating a makeup brand.","Was I a businessman to start with? I'm not sure. I mean, that comes slowly, when you start having the products out. But at the same time, I was very determined. I knew that I had to make it work. I had no choice.","I'm always scared of trends. The runways are always so trend-oriented, but I always feel for the women. The real women that buy cosmetics want to see the trends, but they don't necessarily go for them. And I always encourage women to find what looks best on them.","Even with - the best make-up in the world won't look good if you don't cleanse and exfoliate and have a good basic regime. This is why one of my goals has always been to create a skincare line.","As a make-up artist, you always want to be in a good light, whether you're walking down the street or in a restaurant. It is a very key element to me; you can't apply good make-up in a bad light.","I fell in love with New York. I moved here 25 years ago in 1984 after I lived in Paris for six years. In the 1980s, it was the place to be. Here I was able to create NARS, which I would not have been able to create if I stayed in France.","I would find myself in these photo shoots with models and makeup, and I got swept up in it all.","In America, when I first came here, they were used to wearing more make-up - thicker foundation, more Max Factor, that sort of thing. But you have to know who you are and what you look like: if you know yourself a little bit, you don't need to follow trends.","It really has stayed practically the same. It wasn't like I used to do wild punk make-up: no, I always had the same vision.","My mother hated foundation; she hated having a mask on her face - and she pushed me to build my own vision and concept of beauty for women.","I'm not an easily depressed person.","There was a time when you would dream about, say, movie stars. Now, you virtually follow them into their bathroom when they're going to the loo.","It's not that I'm easily shocked. It takes a lot to shock me. And wildness I like. But vulgarity shocks me.","I never thought make-up was like brain surgery.","I never stop thinking about names of products. It's a process that happens 24 hours a day.","When I was a kid, I loved photography, and I loved makeup.","I chose makeup over photography because there was something very sensual about makeup that I loved. But photography was always in the back of my mind. That was always something that I was very connected with: looking at magazines, enjoying photography, and then taking pictures myself when I was a kid.","When you photograph someone, you have to make them feel good, and you know that they want to look good. It's the same relationship that you have when you apply makeup on somebody. We're almost like shrinks.","I had no connections, and the fashion world was a closed elite. So my mother made appointments for herself with three top Parisian makeup artists and spoke highly about me... she was my first publicist!","It's more fun to have a name rather than a number. I think this gives our products a personality. I get the names from literature, movies, opera, traveling, nature, poetry, sometimes even the street. I keep a small book that I write in. I wake up in the middle of the night and jot down a name for a lipstick or an eyeshadow.","Women are very unpredictable.","We love those under-eye circles. It's real life.","I love the dramatic idea of having nothing on.","I love strong looks, so to me, no makeup is strong. As long as it makes a statement, that's what I like. The girls look very real, and I'm probably the only makeup artist who will say that I love a woman without makeup.","I remember this time I worked with Linda Evangelista on a shoot for Richard Avedon. I just put grease on her face, and it was beautiful.","I think Edie Sedgwick comes back, too. Every five or six years, there is always something about Edie, because she was so modern and stylish and elegant and hippie-ish, all at the same time. So I think that people will always love her.","Makeup is very important for a show. It's really an accessory on the runway. You have to be sure that it fits the clothes.","I've seen makeup destroy people and make them look bad if it's badly done.","In a lot of cases, makeup is a fantastic help, and that's why women love makeup in general. It's a fantastic way to help somebody look great. It's not the only way, of course, but it's a major accessory, along with hair, clothes, lighting, all those things.","Being a studio make-up artist and working on magazines was the only thing I wanted to do.","There is a tendency to feature more actresses on covers, but I'm a big model lover. I grew up watching these models, and they gave me the wish, the need, to work in the fashion industry. I loved watching them - their beauty, the way they worked in front of the camera and that power of transformation, especially in the Seventies.","Sometimes I'm attracted to more odd girls with stronger faces and features or a softer beauty with a lot of character.","It was the early Seventies, and I discovered makeup by going through my mother's fashion magazines. I fell in love with the photos, the models, the fashion.","I don't think there's a major change between runway and real life anymore.","Women don't want to feel like they're wearing makeup. I hope I was partly responsible for that.","It's one thing to read about how makeup is applied. It's another thing altogether to watch it being put on.","I wanted to be a make up artist. I did it, and the road that I took was quite good.","I love so much the models from the '60s and the '70s. They were extremely professional, great models who knew how to work the camera so well and loved fashion and had a great sense of style.","I photographed Alek Wek. She was amazing, and nobody knew about her then. It was a really strong photograph of her.","I'm not so interested in perfect, plastic beauty, and I think it translates in the girls I've shot over the years for Nars, from Guinevere to Iris to Mariacarla. I love those girls. I love the more interesting faces, with maybe a strange nose, not just the Texan blonde. By picking those girls, I think it's changed what I've seen in other campaigns.","Working on fashion shows, you work with the designer and try to read his brain - what was in the creative process, what images did he have in his head?","Having worked with so many of the geniuses, I'd learned so much. It's the best sort of photography school, to work with people like Penn or Avedon or Meisel.","Kate Moss makes you dream. She has such a passion for art and the creative process.","I love to collaborate with artists, like Guy Bourdin and Steven Klein, who don't have any boundaries.","The '80s and '90s were the greatest time to be a makeup artist.","From the start, I used a different kind of girl in Nars campaign images. My choice to use models of colour such as Alek Wek, Naomi Campbell and Karen Park Goude was absolutely a deliberate one. I felt that makeup was universal and should apply to everybody.","I didn't want to create a makeup line for one ethnic group; it had to be multi-ethnic. To me, beauty is beauty. It doesn't matter to me what colour the skin is.","It's very hard for me to photograph someone when I'm not attracted by who they are.","I can't remember the first time, but I've worked with supermodels almost from day one.","I met Iman and Jerry Hall and all those girls in the late Seventies right when I started working at the fashion shows in Paris as an assistant.","I made contours and all that, but in real life, you have to be very careful with that because you can go out in the street and look terrible. All those girls who show how to do contour, they do it quite well, but they're like makeup artists. They're in artificial light.","Some people put a lot of fuss around them. I'm not an entertainer. Let's not get things confused.","People have to learn that everybody is the same. If you wake up in the morning, even if you're a movie star, you look like everybody else. The reality is that makeup is there to help. That's what it's for.","I launched NARS with 12 shades of lipsticks, and many, many launches later, I'm still most proud of our lipsticks.","Women are being more experimental with eye color.","Makeup is an accessory to fashion. You buy a bag, you buy shoes, you put on eyeliner, you buy a lipstick, makeup compliments the clothes.","I'm always looking to the lightweight superproduct that you apply and almost don't see. That's the ultimate, at least for me.","I hate knowing where people go to the bathroom. You follow them going to pee, to eat - I hate everything when it comes to reality shows!","Go with what you're attracted to."],"Francois Pervis":["A sprinter is never satisfied; otherwise, he is not a sprinter.","I checked on the Internet this morning, and I realized that with five individual world titles, I was level with my elders Florian Rousseau and Arnaud Tournant, who were the sprint leaders in France when I started at the French Institute of Sports and taught me everything. I had the chance to overtake them, and I did it.","It's good to break records, I love it."],"Francois Pinault":["I have no sense of nostalgia. Tomorrow is what interests me.","The Italians live well. They have problems, like all countries, but they are well-dressed, the women are pretty.","My mission is not to forbid French art. If the quality is there, I buy; if the quality isn't there, I don't.","The passion for art is, as for believers, very religious. It unites people, its message is of common humanity. Art has become my religion - others pray in church. It's a banality, but you don't possess art, it possesses you. It's like falling in love."],"Francois Rabelais":["To good and true love fear is forever affixed.","If the skies fall, one may hope to catch larks.","Debts and lies are generally mixed together.","Gestures, in love, are incomparably more attractive, effective and valuable than words.","I have known many who could not when they would, for they had not done it when they could.","The right moment wears a full head of hair: when it has been missed, you can't get it back; it's bald in the back of the head and never turns around.","Friends, you will notice that in this world there are many more ballocks than men. Remember this.","Ignorance is the mother of all evils.","We always long for the forbidden things, and desire what is denied us.","Nature abhors a vacuum.","Time, which wears down and diminishes all things, augments and increases good deeds, because a good turn liberally offered to a reasonable man grows continually through noble thought and memory.","The farce is finished.

It is often merely for an excuse that we say things are impossible.","The accent of one's birthplace remains in the mind and in the heart as in one's speech.","I have always been an admirer. I regard the gift of admiration as indispensable if one is to amount to something; I don't know where I would be without it.","One forgives to the degree that one loves.","We are so accustomed to disguise ourselves to others that in the end we become disguised to ourselves.","Heat of blood makes young people change their inclinations often, and habit makes old ones keep to theirs a great while.","Hypocrisy is the homage vice pays to virtue.","What men have called friendship is only a social arrangement, a mutual adjustment of interests, an interchange of services given and received; it is, in sum, simply a business from which those involved propose to derive a steady profit for their own self-love.","People that are conceited of their own merit take pride in being unfortunate, that themselves and others may think them considerable enough to be the envy and the mark of fortune.","As one grows older, one becomes wiser and more foolish.","It is a great act of cleverness to be able to conceal one's being clever.","The intellect is always fooled by the heart.","What is called generosity is usually only the vanity of giving; we enjoy the vanity more than the thing given.","Absence diminishes mediocre passions and increases great ones, as the wind extinguishes candles and fans fires.","In the misfortunes of our best friends we always find something not altogether displeasing to us.","There are but very few men clever enough to know all the mischief they do.","Good advice is something a man gives when he is too old to set a bad example.","The principal point of cleverness is to know how to value things just as they deserve.","To achieve greatness one should live as if they will never die.","The moderation of people in prosperity is the effect of a smooth and composed temper, owing to the calm of their good fortune.","Gratitude is merely the secret hope of further favors.","The reason why so few people are agreeable in conversation is that each is thinking more about what he intends to say than others are saying.","We always love those who admire us, but we do not always love those whom we admire.","There is a kind of elevation which does not depend on fortune; it is a certain air which distinguishes us, and seems to destine us for great things; it is a price which we imperceptibly set upon ourselves.","We seldom find people ungrateful so long as it is thought we can serve them.","Perfect Valor is to do, without a witness, all that we could do before the whole world.","Few people have the wisdom to prefer the criticism that would do them good, to the praise that deceives them.","Nature seems at each man's birth to have marked out the bounds of his virtues and vices, and to have determined how good or how wicked that man shall be capable of being.","The only thing that should surprise us is that there are still some things that can surprise us.","It is not enough to have great qualities; We should also have the management of them.","We would frequently be ashamed of our good deeds if people saw all of the motives that produced them.","Politeness is a desire to be treated politely, and to be esteemed polite oneself.","We all have enough strength to endure the misfortunes of others.","If we did not flatter ourselves, the flattery of others could never harm us.","Nothing is so contagious as example; and we never do any great good or evil which does not produce its like.","The surest way to be deceived is to consider oneself cleverer than others.","A wise man thinks it more advantageous not to join the battle than to win.","Perfect valour consists in doing without witnesses that which we would be capable of doing before everyone.","It's the height of folly to want to be the only wise one.","Most people know no other way of judging men's worth but by the vogue they are in, or the fortunes they have met with.","Virtue would go far if vanity did not keep it company.","There is only one kind of love, but there are a thousand imitations.","There is no better proof of a man's being truly good than his desiring to be constantly under the observation of good men.","There is no disguise which can hide love for long where it exists, or simulate it where it does not.","Hope, deceiving as it is, serves at least to lead us to the end of our lives by an agreeable route.","Why is it that our memory is good enough to retain the least triviality that happens to us, and yet not good enough to recollect how often we have told it to the same person?","Decency is the least of all laws, but yet it is the law which is most strictly observed.","What makes the pain we feel from shame and jealousy so cutting is that vanity can give us no assistance in bearing them.","If we have not peace within ourselves, it is in vain to seek it from outward sources.","Those who are incapable of committing great crimes do not readily suspect them in others.","Mediocre minds usually dismiss anything which reaches beyond their own understanding.","Old people love to give good advice; it compensates them for their inability to set a bad example.","As it is the characteristic of great wits to say much in few words, so small wits seem to have the gift of speaking much and saying nothing.","The accent of a man's native country remains in his mind and his heart, as it does in his speech.","Jealousy lives upon doubts. It becomes madness or ceases entirely as soon as we pass from doubt to certainty.","One can find women who have never had one love affair, but it is rare indeed to find any who have had only one.","Perhaps being old is having lighted rooms inside your head, and people in them, acting. People you know, yet can't quite name.","Repentance is not so much remorse for what we have done as the fear of the consequences.","One is never fortunate or as unfortunate as one imagines.","The sure mark of one born with noble qualities is being born without envy.","We are more interested in making others believe we are happy than in trying to be happy ourselves.","Love often leads on to ambition, but seldom does one return from ambition to love.","We are never so ridiculous through what we are as through what we pretend to be.","Self-interest makes some people blind, and others sharp-sighted.","If we judge love by most of its effects, it resembles rather hatred than affection.","What we call generosity is for the most part only the vanity of giving; and we exercise it because we are more fond of that vanity than of the thing we give.","They that apply themselves to trifling matters commonly become incapable of great ones.","The force we use on ourselves, to prevent ourselves from loving, is often more cruel than the severest treatment at the hands of one loved.","Perfect behavior is born of complete indifference.","There are crimes which become innocent and even glorious through their splendor, number and excess.","Too great haste to repay an obligation is a kind of ingratitude.","When we are in love we often doubt that which we most believe.","We promise in proportion to our hopes, and we deliver in proportion to our fears.","We are more often treacherous through weakness than through calculation.","If we resist our passions, it is more due to their weakness than our strength.","Quarrels would not last long if the fault was only on one side.","Never give anyone the advice to buy or sell shares, because the most benevolent price of advice can turn out badly.","To know how to hide one's ability is great skill.","We should often feel ashamed of our best actions if the world could see all the motives which produced them.","Flattery is a kind of bad money, to which our vanity gives us currency.","If it were not for the company of fools, a witty man would often be greatly at a loss.","We only confess our little faults to persuade people that we have no big ones.","We are nearer loving those who hate us than those who love us more than we wish.","In the human heart new passions are forever being born; the overthrow of one almost always means the rise of another.","The passions are the only orators which always persuade.","A refusal of praise is a desire to be praised twice.","When we disclaim praise, it is only showing our desire to be praised a second time.","It is great folly to wish to be wise all alone.","We always get bored with those whom we bore.","Pride does not wish to owe and vanity does not wish to pay.","Not all those who know their minds know their hearts as well.","Some people displease with merit, and others' very faults and defects are pleasing.","The defects and faults of the mind are like wounds in the body; after all imaginable care has been taken to heal them up, still there will be a scar left behind, and they are in continual danger of breaking the skin and bursting out again.","The more one loves a mistress, the more one is ready to hate her.","That good disposition which boasts of being most tender is often stifled by the least urging of self-interest.","We may seem great in an employment below our worth, but we very often look little in one that is too big for us.","However greatly we distrust the sincerity of those we converse with, yet still we think they tell more truth to us than to anyone else.","We pardon to the extent that we love.","A great many men's gratitude is nothing but a secret desire to hook in more valuable kindnesses hereafter.","You can find women who have never had an affair, but it is hard to find a woman who has had just one.","We are sometimes as different from ourselves as we are from others.","Though nature be ever so generous, yet can she not make a hero alone. Fortune must contribute her part too; and till both concur, the work cannot be perfected.","If there be a love pure and free from the admixture of our other passions, it is that which lies hidden in the bottom of our heart, and which we know not ourselves.","Jealousy is bred in doubts. When those doubts change into certainties, then the passion either ceases or turns absolute madness.","The word virtue is as useful to self-interest as the vices.","Moderation is the feebleness and sloth of the soul, whereas ambition is the warmth and activity of it.","No man deserves to be praised for his goodness, who has it not in his power to be wicked. Goodness without that power is generally nothing more than sloth, or an impotence of will.","Jealously is always born with love but it does not die with it.","The desire to seem clever often keeps us from being so.","All the passions make us commit faults; love makes us commit the most ridiculous ones.","The reason that lovers never weary each other is because they are always talking about themselves.","The mind cannot long play the heart's role.","Though men are apt to flatter and exalt themselves with their great achievements, yet these are, in truth, very often owing not so much to design as chance.","Ridicule dishonors a man more than dishonor does.","Most of our faults are more pardonable than the means we use to conceal them.","Everyone complains of his memory, and nobody complains of his judgment.","No man is clever enough to know all the evil he does.","We are strong enough to bear the misfortunes of others.","We get so much in the habit of wearing disguises before others that we finally appear disguised before ourselves.","We would rather speak ill of ourselves than not talk about ourselves at all.","Why can we remember the tiniest detail that has happened to us, and not remember how many times we have told it to the same person.","Men give away nothing so liberally as their advice.","There are various sorts of curiosity; one is from interest, which makes us desire to know that which may be useful to us; and the other, from pride which comes from the wish to know what others are ignorant of.","There are bad people who would be less dangerous if they were quite devoid of goodness.","Weakness of character is the only defect which cannot be amended.","We confess our little faults to persuade people that we have no large ones.","Confidence contributes more to conversation than wit.","The heart is forever making the head its fool.","Conceit causes more conversation than wit.","There are very few people who are not ashamed of having been in love when they no longer love each other.","We only acknowledge small faults in order to make it appear that we are free from great ones.","How can we expect another to keep our secret if we have been unable to keep it ourselves?","In love we often doubt what we most believe.","Funeral pomp is more for the vanity of the living than for the honor of the dead.","The one thing people are the most liberal with, is their advice.","We give advice, but we cannot give the wisdom to profit by it.","Old age is a tyrant, who forbids, under pain of death, the pleasures of youth.","Old men are fond of giving good advice to console themselves for their inability to give bad examples.","We seldom find any person of good sense, except those who share our opinions.","If we had no faults of our own, we should not take so much pleasure in noticing those in others.","Usually we praise only to be praised.","Silence is the safest course for any man to adopt who distrust himself.","Neither the sun nor death can be looked at with a steady eye.","Gracefulness is to the body what understanding is to the mind.","If we are to judge of love by its consequences, it more nearly resembles hatred than friendship.","Great souls are not those who have fewer passions and more virtues than others, but only those who have greater designs.","In most of mankind gratitude is merely a secret hope of further favors.","The virtues and vices are all put in motion by interest.","It is easier to know men in general, than men in particular.","The mind is always the patsy of the heart.","Few things are impracticable in themselves; and it is for want of application, rather than of means, that men fail to succeed.","Those who occupy their minds with small matters, generally become incapable of greatness.","Timidity is a fault for which it is dangerous to reprove persons whom we wish to correct of it.","In all professions each affects a look and an exterior to appear what he wishes the world to believe that he is. Thus we may say that the whole world is made up of appearances.","It is easier to appear worthy of a position one does not hold, than of the office which one fills.","Taste may change, but inclination never.","The happiness and misery of men depend no less on temper than fortune.","We do not despise all those who have vices, but we do despise those that have no virtue.","Before we set our hearts too much upon anything, let us examine how happy they are, who already possess it.","It takes nearly as much ability to know how to profit by good advice as to know how to act for one's self.","It is easier to be wise for others than for ourselves.","We promise according to our hopes and perform according to our fears.","There are heroes in evil as well as in good.","We often forgive those who bore us, but we cannot forgive those whom we bore.","What seems to be generosity is often no more than disguised ambition, which overlooks a small interest in order to secure a great one.","Nothing prevents one from appearing natural as the desire to appear natural.","Being a blockhead is sometimes the best security against being cheated by a man of wit.","The defects of the mind, like those of the face, grow worse with age.","We are so used to dissembling with others that in time we come to deceive and dissemble with ourselves.","We may sooner be brought to love them that hate us, than them that love us more than we would have them do.","Our virtues are often, in reality, no better than vices disguised.","It is from a weakness and smallness of mind that men are opinionated; and we are very loath to believe what we are not able to comprehend.","There are very few things impossible in themselves; and we do not want means to conquer difficulties so much as application and resolution in the use of means.","There is many a virtuous woman weary of her trade.","A man is sometimes as different from himself as he is from others.","We have no patience with other people's vanity because it is offensive to our own.","However glorious an action in itself, it ought not to pass for great if it be not the effect of wisdom and intention.","Nothing hinders a thing from being natural so much as the straining ourselves to make it seem so.","Perfect courage is to do without witnesses what one would be capable of doing with the world looking on.","Women's virtue is frequently nothing but a regard to their own quiet and a tenderness for their reputation.","The greatest part of intimate confidences proceed from a desire either to be pitied or admired.","Some accidents there are in life that a little folly is necessary to help us out of.","Innocence does not find near so much protection as guilt.","It is with an old love as it is with old age a man lives to all the miseries, but is dead to all the pleasures.","When a man must force himself to be faithful in his love, this is hardly better than unfaithfulness.","When a man is in love, he doubts, very often, what he most firmly believes.","Many men are contemptuous of riches; few can give them away.","We seldom praise anyone in good earnest, except such as admire us.","Philosophy finds it an easy matter to vanquish past and future evils, but the present are commonly too hard for it.","Some counterfeits reproduce so very well the truth that it would be a flaw of judgment not to be deceived by them.","We are very far from always knowing our own wishes.","Pride, which inspires us with so much envy, is sometimes of use toward the moderating of it too.","Only the contemptible fear contempt.","We are easily comforted for the misfortunes of our friends, when those misfortunes give us an occasion of expressing our affection and solicitude.","Those that have had great passions esteem themselves for the rest of their lives fortunate and unfortunate in being cured of them.","The desire of talking of ourselves, and showing those faults we do not mind having seen, makes up a good part of our sincerity.","It is not in the power of even the most crafty dissimulation to conceal love long, where it really is, nor to counterfeit it long where it is not.","A man's worth has its season, like fruit.","The man that thinks he loves his mistress for her own sake is mightily mistaken.","The name and pretense of virtue is as serviceable to self-interest as are real vices.","It is often laziness and timidity that keep us within our duty while virtue gets all the credit.","It is almost always a fault of one who loves not to realize when he ceases to be loved.","Every one speaks well of his own heart, but no one dares speak well of his own mind.","We do not praise others, ordinarily, but in order to be praised ourselves.","There are a great many men valued in society who have nothing to recommend them but serviceable vices.","There are few virtuous women who are not bored with their trade.","There is nothing men are so generous of as advice.","Fortune converts everything to the advantage of her favorites.","No men are oftener wrong than those that can least bear to be so.","People always complain about their memories, never about their minds.","We easily forgive our friends those faults that do no affect us ourselves.","Love can no more continue without a constant motion than fire can; and when once you take hope and fear away, you take from it its very life and being.","We often pardon those that annoy us, but we cannot pardon those we annoy.","He is not to pass for a man of reason who stumbles upon reason by chance but he who knows it and can judge it and has a true taste for it.","Whatever good things people say of us, they tell us nothing new.","When our vices leave us, we like to imagine it is we who are leaving them.","The first lover is kept a long while, when no offer is made of a second.","We are all strong enough to bear other men's misfortunes.","Men often pass from love to ambition, but they seldom come back again from ambition to love.","The generality of virtuous women are like hidden treasures, they are safe only because nobody has sought after them.","Our actions seem to have their lucky and unlucky stars, to which a great part of that blame and that commendation is due which is given to the actions themselves.","In friendship as well as love, ignorance very often contributes more to our happiness than knowledge.","What keeps us from abandoning ourselves entirely to one vice, often, is the fact that we have several.","On neither the sun, nor death, can a man look fixedly.","Our concern for the loss of our friends is not always from a sense of their worth, but rather of our own need of them and that we have lost some who had a good opinion of us.","He who lives without folly isn't so wise as he thinks.","Our aversion to lying is commonly a secret ambition to make what we say considerable, and have every word received with a religious respect.","We come altogether fresh and raw into the several stages of life, and often find ourselves without experience, despite our years.","How is it that we remember the least triviality that happens to us, and yet not remember how often we have recounted it to the same person?","We say little, when vanity does not make us speak.","We should often blush for our very best actions, if the world did but see all the motives upon which they were done."],"Francois de Malherbe":["Our days and nights have sorrows woven with delights.","To will what God doth will, that is the only science that gives us any rest."],"Francois-Henri Pinault":["Sustainable development is a fundamental break that's going to reshuffle the entire deck. There are companies today that are going to dominate in the future simply because they understand that.","You don't buy luxury to enter a community, but to set yourself apart from others.","Linguistics is a good way of defining the culture of a brand. The vocabulary used by sports and lifestyle brands - running, fitness, training, motorsports - is all about functionality, whereas the vocabulary of the luxury business - handbags, ready-to-wear - is all about the product.","In a recession, you must be able to call into question everything you've done before.","Luxury hasn't been democratised; it's been globalised.","The first PC that I actually bought myself was a Toshiba Papman in 1985. This model was one of the very first laptops; I remember that it was a revolution at the time!","I started buying on the Internet quite rapidly, as early as 1995.","I closely follow everything about user interface or human-computer interface: technology that makes computers closer to the way the human being actually functions.","I like to discover new things, and I'm always testing new apps.","I have a regular, normal private life.","There's a strength to being able to look at products through a customer's eyes, but it is also dangerous.","I'd never buy something, even if it's a great brand, that is a competitor to something I already own; that's insane."],"Francoise Gilot":["For me, style is essentially doing things well. If you want to be outrageous, be outrageous with style. If you want to be restrained, be restrained with style. One can't specifically define style. It's like the perfume to a flower. It's a quality you can't analyze.","I'm not going to talk about Picasso. I have done my duty to those memories. I have had a great career as an artist myself, you know. I'm not here just because I've spent time with Picasso.","I really think that if I had met Picasso during peacetime, nothing would have happened.","To change your mind about something is always difficult. I think that people who are big enough to admit they were wrong can be counted on your fingers.","Matisse was my God. I'm a French artist, that's for sure. I am color-oriented and what you might call a composer. I am not pouring my guts out; I keep them inside.","I don't write diaries and things like that, but I have a fantastic memory. I call that like a magic carpet. I can really concentrate and travel back in the past I don't know how many years from now and evoke that space if I wanted.","'Matisse and Picasso' is a little like Plato after Socrates. Socrates only taught in words. He didn't write. And after that, you had Plato and Aristotle to write about what he had said. I write about them because they didn't write about them.","What I like about the American woman is she usually has a lot of dynamism. In the U.S., women have a tendency to go forward, to be more exaggerated than in Europe. Many times the rough ideas come from the States, then they are refined in Europe. The American women and the French women are still the best-dressed."],"Francoise Hardy":["When I write, it is always the melody that comes first, and it just happens to be the case that the most beautiful tunes are sad, and the lyrics follow the mood of the melody.","In France, the image I had was of a shy girl - a poor lonely girl and not too good-looking. When I went to England, I had another image. I felt the journalists were much more interested in my looks than in my songs.","I feel happy and secure when I'm on my bed with a good book... I forget everything which is terrible in our world.","I never get bored. There isn't enough time in the day for me."],"Francoise Sagan":["To jealousy, nothing is more frightful than laughter.","A dress makes no sense unless it inspires men to take it off of you.","Art must take reality by surprise.","Jazz music is an intensified feeling of nonchalance.","One can never speak enough of the virtues, the dangers, the power of shared laughter.","I always believe things are going to work out.","The one thing I regret is that I will never have time to read all the books I want to read.","It seems to me that there are two kinds of trickery: the 'fronts' people assume before one another's eyes, and the 'front' a writer puts on the face of reality.","Of course the illusion of art is to make one believe that great literature is very close to life, but exactly the opposite is true. Life is amorphous, literature is formal.","Every little girl knows about love. It is only her capacity to suffer because of it that increases.","Writing is a question of finding a certain rhythm. I compare it to the rhythms of jazz. Much of the time life is a sort of rhythmic progression of three characters. If one tells oneself that life is like that, one feels it less arbitrary.","After Proust, there are certain things that simply cannot be done again. He marks off for you the boundaries of your talent.","Marriage? It's like asparagus eaten with vinaigrette or hollandaise, a matter of taste but of no importance.","I had a strong desire to write and some free time.","For me writing is a question of finding a certain rhythm. I compare it to the rhythms of jazz.","Much of the time life is a sort of rhythmic progression of three characters. If one tells oneself that life is like that, one feels it less arbitrary.","I've tried very hard and I've never found any resemblance between the people I know and the people in my novels.","It would be bad form for me to describe people I don't know and don't understand.","All my life, I will continue obstinately to write about love, solitude and passion among the kind of people I know. The rest don't interest me.","I dreamt of being a writer once I started to read. I started to write 'Bonjour Tristesse' in bistros around the Sorbonne. I finished it, I sent it to editors. It was accepted.","I've read Proust and Stendhal. That keeps you in your place.","You should celebrate the end of a love affair as they celebrate death in New Orleans, with songs, laughter, dancing and a lot of wine.","Every time I see a film about Joan of Arc I'm convinced she'll get away with it. It's the only way to get through life."],"Franjo Tudjman":["If Yugoslavia is to exist, it can exist only as an alliance, a confederation of independent states.","Let's make a deal with the Serbs. Neither history nor emotion in the Balkans will permit multinationalism. We have to give up on the illusion of the last eight years... Dayton isn't working. Nobody - except diplomats and petty officials - believes in a sovereign Bosnia and the Dayton accords.","The West wanted to avoid an Islamic state in Europe.","The estimated loss of up to six million dead is founded too much on both emotional, biased testimonies and on exaggerated data in the postwar reckonings of war crimes and on the squaring of accounts with the defeated.","Whatever happened after the liberation of Krajina, this was in no way a violation of human rights by Croatian authorities.","I joined the anti-Fascist struggle with my best friend, who was a Jew.","The Muslims wanted to reign over the whole of Mostar, then gain ground to the sea and finally create an Islamic state. That is what our Croatians defend themselves against.","All sorts of other lies are being spread today, I do not know what else they will invent. I've heard that I'm of Jewish descent, but I found, I knew of my ancestors in Zagorje from around 350 years ago, and I said, maybe it would be good to have some of that, I guess I would be richer, I might not have become a Communist.","I haven't mentioned another argument, The Hague tribunal. It is clear our generals and all of you who are sitting here now with me could end up there, too.","Then, as if that's not enough, then they declare that my wife is Jewish or Serbian. Luckily for me, she never was either, although many wives are. And so on and so forth spreading lies.","You should give no indication that we wish the three-way division of Bosnia."],"Frank A. Clark":["A father is a man who expects his son to be as good a man as he meant to be.","The most important thing that parents can teach their children is how to get along without them.","Most smiles are started by another smile.","A baby is born with a need to be loved - and never outgrows it.","If you find a path with no obstacles, it probably doesn't lead anywhere.","Everyone is trying to accomplish something big, not realizing that life is made up of little things.","Criticism, like rain, should be gentle enough to nourish a man's growth without destroying his roots.","Real generosity is doing something nice for someone who will never find out.","We find comfort among those who agree with us - growth among those who don't.","A man's conscience, like a warning line on the highway, tells him what he shouldn't do - but it does not keep him from doing it.","It's hard to detect good luck - it looks so much like something you've earned.","Kindness makes a fellow feel good whether it's being done to him or by him.","Why not upset the apple cart? If you don't, the apples will rot anyway.","If a fellow isn't thankful for what he's got, he isn't likely to be thankful for what he's going to get.","Modern man is frantically trying to earn enough to buy things he's too busy to enjoy.","The reason there's so much ignorance is that those who have it are so eager to share it.","I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it.","Gossip needn't be false to be evil - there's a lot of truth that shouldn't be passed around.","I'd rather see folks doubt what's true than accept what isn't.","Many folks think they aren't good at earning money, when what they don't know is how to use it.","The more you learn to live without, the more you'll have to live with.","There's nothing that can help you understand your beliefs more than trying to explain them to an inquisitive child.","Maybe a person's time would be as well spent raising food as raising money to buy food.","A leading authority is anyone who has guessed right more than once.","We've put more effort into helping folks reach old age than into helping them enjoy it.","A child, like your stomach, doesn't need all you can afford to give it.","Habit is something you can do without thinking, which is why most of us have so many of them.","We're all generous, but with different things, like time, money, talent - criticism."],"Frank Abagnale":["A real man loves his wife, and places his family as the most important thing in life. Nothing has brought me more peace and content in life than simply being a good husband and father.","A real man loves and respects his wife and is not only a good father but a man that his kids want to call 'Daddy.'","If you look at any successful professional - a salesperson, a marketer, a real estate agent, a trader - they all have the same qualities as the con man. The only difference is that one side uses their talents in the right direction and the con man is taking the easy way out.","The police can't protect consumers. People need to be more aware and educated about identity theft. You need to be a little bit wiser, a little bit smarter and there's nothing wrong with being skeptical. We live in a time when if you make it easy for someone to steal from you, someone will.","We all grow up. Hopefully, we get wiser. Age brings wisdom, and fatherhood changes one's life completely.","In the old days, a con man would be good looking, suave, well dressed, well spoken and presented themselves real well. Those days are gone because it's not necessary. The people committing these crimes are doing them from hundreds of miles away.","There is no technology today that cannot be defeated by social engineering.","You have to think a little smarter, be proactive, not reactive.","Criminals look at identity theft and say only 1 in 700 criminals gets convicted of it. And they look at check forgery and they know that for every 1,400 forgers arrested, only about 123 get convicted and about 26 go to jail. So the rewards are great, but the risks are very slim. So that's one of the reasons that make it very popular.","I think I was so successful, not because I was brilliant, but because I was so young. I had no fear of consequences.","Nothing has brought me more love, joy and peace than being a good husband and good daddy.","Every breach you look at occurred because somebody inside did something they weren't supposed to do. Sometimes there's an accomplice, but most of the time, it's innocent.","We should be very concerned: if identity theft is so simple to do, what's to stop me from entering this country and assuming the identity of someone else for the sole purpose of living here illegally for terrorist reasons? That alone would be a concern.","Whether you're earning $7 an hour or $700,000 a year, it's very important to protect your credit rating.","We're coming down to an extremely unethical society. Very few colleges offer courses in ethics, and very few companies have a code of conduct or code of ethics.","As the lawyer, I found most of it was a matter of research, which I was great at - that's what I did to death - and then basically persuading people that you're right, and they're wrong... I found that the easiest of all the professions to impersonate.","The truth is, your identity already has been stolen.","Why do the Yankees always win? The other team can't stop looking at the pinstripes.","I have to be honest with you: When the FBI let me out of prison early to advise the agency on preventing fraud, I wasn't a changed person. I wasn't rehabilitated. But when I started working with the FBI, one of the most ethical groups of men and women in the world, I couldn't help but have some of that character rub off on me.","I don't use a debit card. The safest thing is a credit card because you're using the bank's money. If someone accesses your information, they are stealing the bank's money, not yours.","People say that life is short, but it isn't short. It's very long.","It's amazing how much information we share in social media, then we wonder why people steal our identity.","Most people don't recognize me, but they know my name. TSA people rarely recognize my name, ironically, and they are the security people.","There's no such thing as a foolproof system. That idea fails to take into account the creativity of fools.","People have found very significant and simple ways to cheat their employer and get money out of their employers, and many companies lack good internal controls.","Almost any fault, sin or crime is considered more leniently if there's a touch of class involved.","I have never witnessed, nor will I live long enough to witness, a more simplistic crime than me stealing your identity.","I contend that there really are no more con men. There's no need for con men anymore. There's no need for the very sophisticated, suave guy, the well-dressed guy. Today, you steal with the computer from thousands of miles away - from China, from Libya, from Hong Kong. Your victim's never going to see you, so there's no need to be any of that.","If I had the uniform on, you didn't doubt for a moment I was a pilot. No one ever blinked an eye if I tried to cash a cheque wearing that uniform.","I never use debit cards. I only use credit cards. This way, if someone does get my account number... and charges $1 million, by federal law, my liability is zero.","If my forgeries looked as bad as the CBS documents, it would have been 'Catch Me In Two Days'.","If I had been brilliant or a genius, I wouldn't have needed to break the law just to survive.","I was very blessed it was Steven Spielberg who made the movie. He was very much into the redemption side of the story. They asked him in an interview why he had owned the rights to this story for 20 years before he made the movie, and he said, 'I wanted to see what the real Frank Abagnale did with his life before I immortalised him on film.'","I speak at a lot of universities, and people are always worried about Facebook, and when I explain how to use it properly, they immediately go back and make those changes.","You cannot rely on the police, you cannot rely on the government, you cannot rely on the bank to protect you.","I owe a debt to my country 800 times greater than I could ever repay.","You can sit in a room and create anything you want on a laptop. That's why the real con men are gone.","My father was never really the con-man type that the film shows him to be: he was straight as an arrow, though he did have problems with the IRS.","What I did in my youth is hundreds of times easier today. Technology breeds crime.","I'm a true believer that you have a moral obligation to keep your employees honest, and that is why you have controls, so I'm never tempted or put in a position where I could do something to defraud my employer.","Banks are so protected from liability they would have to really do something that was their mistake in order for them to be liable for it. Banks don't look at signatures. They're processing millions of checks and they have very little liability.","The front of a cheque alone gives someone enough information to steal your identity.","Technology breeds crime and we are constantly trying to develop technology to stay one step ahead of the person trying to use it negatively.","Every case involving cybercrime that I've been involved in, I've never found a master criminal sitting somewhere in Russia or Hong Kong or Beijing. It always ends up that somebody at the company did something they weren't supposed to do. They read an email, went to a website they weren't supposed to.","My proudest moment was probably when my oldest boy finished law school and went on to become an FBI agent. It was just beyond my imagination that - with my background - my own son would become an FBI agent.","When people ask me about being portrayed onscreen by Leonardo DiCaprio, I always say, 'I love it - no matter how old I get, people are going to think that's what I look like.'","Most people are fascinated by what I did as a teenager, but when I look back at my life, I don't think very much about those years. I was an opportunist and got away with things because I was very young, but I went to prison and came out and remade my life.","I use a shredder for bank statements and phone bills. Most people use ribbon shredders that cut things straight: we can put those back together in an hour. Look for a security microcut shredder, which cuts papers into confetti.","I was just a guy who ran away from home at 16 because my parents were getting a divorce and the judge was making me choose which parent to live with. I didn't want to make that choice. I ended up in New York City.","I think my wife understood from the day I met her how important she was to me and how important it was for me becoming a husband and a father.","If you happen to tell me where you were born, your date of birth and that kind of information, then I'm 98 percent of the way to stealing your identity.","The biggest thing that concerns me is when we start getting countries using cybercrime to shut down infrastructure, electricity, communications systems, the Internet, et cetera.","The Internet is a wonderful thing, but it opens the door to many crimes, so you have to stay ahead of it.","When 'Catch Me If You Can' was published back in 1980, I never dreamed that it would become a bestseller, much less a major motion picture and now a big Broadway musical. What's amazing about the book is that it has never gone out of print.","I was an opportunist and got away with things because I was very young, but I went to prison and came out and remade my life.","It's amazing to me that we live in such a wonderful country where anyone can have a problem in life and get up, dust themselves off and start all over again.","The law sometimes sleeps; it never dies.","If you took a child in London and took their iPhone and took them somewhere else in the country, they'd probably not be able to find their way back. That's a shame.","I would have thought technology would have made it harder to do what I did.","It's quite flattering to have Leonardo DiCaprio play you in the movie. He's a great-looking young man.","I served my time and came out of prison when I was just 26 and have worked with the government for 37 years. But people only remember me for what I did before that.","Criminals know that if they stay under certain thresholds, nobody is going to come after them.","Mostly, cybercriminals are motivated to commit crime for financial gain.","The Internet can be used to hurt many people.","You have to be smarter and a wiser businessperson and consumer. You have to learn to protect yourself through education.","I taught at the FBI for four decades - how to think outside of the box and deal with social engineering.","If you tell me your name and date of birth, that's all I need to steal your identity.","While I was on an undercover assignment in Texas, I met my wife, Kelly.","When people write about me, they usually start off with the headline 'World's Greatest Con Man.'","I use a credit card for everything - and I choose one of the ones which gives you money back.","When I look back at my life now, I'm not amazed by what I did at 16 to 21.","I spent five years of my youth in prison - some very bad prisons.","You have to be very limited in who you give your social security number to.","We buy into the computer, and everything that comes from the computer, we believe to be the truth.","In all the years I've taught at the FBI Academy, I've only seen crime get easier, faster, and harder to detect.","At the FBI, very rarely do they investigate crime under $100,000.","One of the most popular scams is what they call account takeover. You write me a check, and I simply go online to a check-printing service and order 200 checks with your account information.","Most people don't reconcile their bank accounts.","We really need to get control over Social Security numbers. My children's generation, they're past it. But their children should be able to have a number that is secure.","It's really frustrating when you're an identity-theft victim, and you go to the police and you say, 'This guy in Florida, he stole my name and got a credit card - this is his address,' and they say, 'We don't have jurisdiction in Florida. You need to go to the FBI.'","One thing I've found is that if you educate and show people the risk, they will do something about it.","I was a millionaire twice over and half again before I was twenty-one. I stole every nickel of it and blew the bulk of the bundle on fine threads, gourmet foods, luxurious lodgings, fantastic foxes, fine wheels, and other sensual goodies.","I wasn't a Pan Am pilot or any other kind of pilot.","I partied in every capital in Europe, basked on all the famous beaches, and good-timed it in South America, the South Seas, the Orient, and the more palatable portions of Africa.","Airline pilots are men to be admired and respected. Men to be trusted. Men of means. And you don't expect an airline pilot to be a local resident. Or a check swindler.","Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye played my parents so well that I really thought I was in my living room at Christmas. My mother couldn't have been played more correctly.","I'm so different from the egotistical, self-centred person I was when I did those things. And to watch someone acting out your memories on the screen is like reliving it. Like someone taking you back and showing you what you did.","People care about others in their immediate network.","I didn't like taking money from individuals.","If I had walked into a dry cleaning store, and I had looked over, and the register drawer was open with money inside, I wouldn't have taken it.","Had I been older - maybe 25 or 30 - I would have never tried half the things I did because I would have rationalized everything and never did it.","I didn't sit outside the bank and plan. I just went in and ad libbed because I was so young. But I was smart enough to know I would absolutely get caught.","You get to a point in your life where you go, 'I don't remember what I did.'","If I wanted to lay down a baby con, I could say I was the product of a broken home. But I'd only be bum-rapping my parents.","I don't believe that a piece of paper will excuse my actions. In the end, only my actions will.","If I check into a hotel, a lot of times, they know who I am.","I don't do online banking.","Every form of payment has some risk associated with it.","I was always accepted at par value. I wore the uniform of a Pan Am pilot; therefore, I must be a Pan Am pilot.","I kept a notebook, a surreptitious journal in which I jotted down phrases, technical data, miscellaneous information, names, dates, places, telephone numbers, thoughts, and a collection of other data I thought was necessary or might prove helpful.","I learned early that class is universally admired.","I went to the library and learned how checks work. I found out that routing numbers are like zip codes: the checks are sent to the bank that correlates to the routing number. If I manipulate those numbers to a bank far away, it would take longer to get back to the bank, which gave me more time to write more bad checks.","It's about taking the time to research and think things out. Honest people and criminals do the same thing; just the direction, good or bad, is different.","You have to believe in what you do. Take something you truly believe in and go about it in an honest way.","You should know, whether you live in the U.S. or in the U.K., that your identity has already been stolen.","You fight technology with technology, so you have to stay one step ahead of the criminal. It's very much a chess game - they make a move, you have to make a move.","It is amazing the information we give away. We make it easier and easier for criminals.","I'm glad I'm a draw. People know that, not only am I the guy that did it, I spent 40 years on the other side.","I teach ethics at the FBI academy, which is ironic.","Too many of us are vulnerable, and I look forward to working with AARP to advise people about the safest ways to conduct their financial transactions and manage social media.","By the time I had reached the age of 16, in the 10th grade, my parents, after 22 years of marriage, one day decided to get a divorce.","Unlike most divorces, where the children were usually the first to know, my parents were very good about keeping that a secret.","I make my home in Tulsa.","I know that people are fascinated by what I did as a teenager, but what I did was immoral, illegal, unethical, and something that I am not proud of - nor will I ever be proud of.","I always knew I'd get caught sooner or later. And I knew I would end up going to prison.","When I was 28 years old, I thought it would be great to have a movie about my life. I was egotistical and self-centered.","A lot of people say I was brilliant. I wasn't. I was an opportunist: a young entrepreneur who saw things and took advantage.","Had I been older, I would've never been able to pull it off because I would've analyzed it to death. When I was 16, there was no such thing as 'what if.'","Everything I have today was because of the love of a woman.","A lot of times, when I met somebody and took them out on a date, I obviously didn't tell them my background, because I didn't think I'd see them but once or twice.","There are many ways to manipulate chip cards. For example, a number of years ago when American Express issued the first chip card, criminals would take a small hammer with a little device and bang the chip to destroy it without hurting the physical appearance of the card.","I went from 198 pounds to 109 while I was in prison in France, and I had to tie my clothes on with rope.","Only one thing makes a man a man. He loves his wife, is faithful to her, and puts his wife and kids as the most important things in life."],"Frank Auerbach":["Real style is not having a program - it's how one behaves in a crisis.","I destroy things every day in the act of working and often recall a picture I had considered finished in order to rework it.","It seems to me madness to wake up in the morning and do something other than paint, considering that one may not wake up the following morning.","The unity in any painter's work arises from the fact that a person, brought to a desperate situation, will behave in a certain way... style.","Ideally, one should have more material than one can possibly cope with.","I'm hoping to make a new thing for the world that remains in the mind like a new species of living thing.","To put down an ideogram of a table so that people will recognize it as a table is not the work of a painter, but to sense it for a moment as a magic carpet with a leg hanging down at each corner is the beginning of a painter's imagination."],"Frank B. Kellogg":["There is no short and easy road, no magic cure for those ills which have afflicted mankind from the dawn of history.","Certain it is that a great responsibility rests upon the statesmen of all nations, not only to fulfill the promises for reduction in armaments, but to maintain the confidence of the people of the world in the hope of an enduring peace.","There are but few naval powers, but there are many land powers.","I know that military alliances and armament have been the reliance for peace for centuries, but they do not produce peace; and when war comes, as it inevitably does under such conditions, these armaments and alliances but intensify and broaden the conflict.","It is not to be expected that human nature will change in a day.","I believe that in the end the abolition of war, the maintenance of world peace, the adjustment of international questions by pacific means will come through the force of public opinion, which controls nations and peoples.","Public opinion shapes our destinies and guides the progress of human affairs.","It is by such means as the prize offered by your Committee that the attention of the world will be focused and that men and women will be inspired to greater efforts in the interest of peace.","The fact that so many of your people are today residents and citizens of the United States, lending their influence to our civic and economic life, which has meant so much to our development.","I know of no greater work for humanity than in the cause of peace, which can only be achieved by the earnest efforts of nations and peoples.","These measures may not constitute an absolute guarantee of peace, but, in my opinion, they constitute the greatest preventive measures ever adopted by nations.","Have we so soon forgotten those four years of terrible carnage, the greatest war of all time; forgotten the millions of men who gave their lives, who made the supreme sacrifice and who today, beneath the soil of France and Belgium, sleep the eternal sleep?","To be sure, in some instances these proceedings have been unconstitutional, but we must remember that it is not the first time since a war that there have been changes in governments by such methods.","Competition in armament, both land and naval, is not only a terrible burden upon the people, but I believe it to be one of the greatest menaces to the peace of the world.","It is true not all has been accomplished that the earnest advocates would desire, but a start has been made.","I have often heard it said that the United States is isolated and is not interested in European affairs. I assure you that this is not the case.","I further value this gift as it gave me an opportunity to accept this distinguished honor in a country so devoted to this cause and whose history marks a wonderful chapter in world development.","Each one of these treaties is a step for the maintenance of peace, an additional guarantee against war. It is through such machinery that the disputes between nations will be settled and war prevented.","I share the opinion of those of broader vision, who see in the signs of the time hope of humanity for peace.","If we will maintain our hope and confidence in the genius of our people, they will work out this problem, and their ability and industry will bring us back to normal conditions.","There has not been a war in South America for fifty years, and I have every confidence that the countries of Central and South America are deeply in earnest in the maintenance of peace.","There will always be disputes between nations which, at times, will inflame the public and threaten conflicts, but the main thing is to educate the people of the world to be ever mindful that there are better means of settling such disputes than by war.","It is idle to say that nations can struggle to outdo each other in building armaments and never use them. History demonstrates the contrary, and we have but to go back to the last war to see the appalling effect of nations competing in great armaments.","Adequate defense has been the catchword of every militarist for centuries.","France and Italy have not yet signed this treaty or agreed to naval limitation as between those nations, but I have confidence that in time they will do so.","I do not hesitate to say that the limitation on naval craft between the great naval powers was too high.","I know of no more important subject to the peace of Europe and the world than the reasonable reduction of armaments, especially in Europe, and of naval armaments throughout the world."],"Frank Black":["It more or less has the shape of a love song, but 'Crescent Moon' reflects more my longing for an ancient romantic context that includes wild animals, fire, danger of death, stellar navigation, and seasonal intuition.","For some artists the live performance is the chicken before the egg of writing or recording of repertoire. For other artists the writing or recording of repertoire is the chicken before the egg of live performance.","I have had UFO experiences, and yet, at the same time, I can easily be convinced that none of it is true. It's hard to say whether or not you're a believer. I've been interested in that subject matter, like lots of people. Perhaps foolishly, I've allowed some of that stuff to creep into my music.","There's more to life than listening to rock music.","It's obvious you shouldn't steal, kill or be cruel.","My most cryptic, strange songs might be my most personal, but that isn't how people are going to receive them, because they don't know the code.","I'm an untrained musician. Untrained musicians don't really have any music theory, they don't have a lot of rules. We break the rules, but it's mostly because we don't know what the rules are. It's easy for us to go to certain places, so I'm not surprised that a lot of people were amused by my songwriting style.","I'm always looking to rock out. But it isn't really about rocking out versus being mellow, in terms of your personal satisfaction. In the end, you just want to be good. When you look at something that's really good, it might be Iggy Pop or it might be Leonard Cohen. Whatever it is, you want it to be really good.","I drive a lot. Just for pleasure. Sometimes I'll get in the Cadillac and drive around the city or the country, kind of trying to get lost basically. Y'know, just see where roads lead.","I have always been a singer, a writer, and a musician, not as a prodigy or as in a trade handed to me by my parents, but because of an inner voice or maybe a command from beyond reality as it is usually defined.","Bob Dylan is quite a songwriter, and a great singer and musician. I won't bother with comparing myself to him, but I will say that I heard his records at a very young age and I still listen to all his records.","But the truth is that critics are by definition critical. That's their job.","People go back to the stuff that doesn't cost a lot of money and the stuff that you don't have to hand money to over and over again. Stuff that you get for free, stuff that your older brother gives you, stuff that you can get out of the local library.","You should never rely on interviews with musicians as being factual. Most of them are mangled and even have made up stuff in them, that is to say, made up stuff by the writer or editor.","I'm not saying that people have to listen to rock music. It's a great, cool thing and it can really be liberating for a lot of people but, hey, so can Charles Dickens so I'm not going to judge.","I like visual images and there are certainly other bands that have strong visual images going all the way back to Elvis Presley, but it's kind of like that's never really been my bag. Probably because I'm too shy.","I've got a small, loyal audience, which is great. And I appreciate that. They're there for me every time.","I don't make records that way, where I'm trying to please the marketplace or anything. Not because I have anything against that, it's just never been a part of my aesthetic, even when I was with the Pixies.","They're a different generation, those kids; kids that are under the age of twelve. They're not that impressed by rock music, you know what I mean? They're like, it's cool and everything, but whatever. They're just as impressed by YouTube.","I certainly have gotten caught up in the music business at various times in my life, mostly because you want to get along with whatever record company you're dealing with. I don't want to be flaky. I don't want to be some temperamental, hard-to-work-with musician.","I've made my records and I've done all the interviews. I've done lots of long tours. I've made stupid videos. I've done all that stuff and learned all the lingo and gone to radio stations and shmoozed with DJs on the air and met retail people.","The dumber half of the audience - whether they're male or female, and a lot of them are male - for some reason responds very quickly to the feminine voice. How can I put it? They kind of instantly react to the female voice in a positive way quicker than they would the male voice.","If you're going to exude naivete, you can't really... walk out there like it's a Sting show. You can't be that well put together and then have this kind of innocent bravado.","I listen to Neil Young and jazz and classical stations and, if my girlfriend's driving, it tends to be Hall & Oates.","They're pretty good actually, Hall & Oates. I gotta give them credit. They got a lot of toe-tappers.","The first thing that inspires any song is a chord progression. When I have one I really like, I get into the lyrics even more.","I have two step-kids and one of my own on the way. That's three college funds.","I don't want to do children's music. I write kids songs, but the kids songs I write are for my kids - like when I'm putting them to bed. We sing some song that we made up but I don't want to make a record like that.","It's sour grapes, I admit, I want to be more famous so people are examining my work couplet by couplet, you know what I mean? That's the level where I want to go.","I think everyone should sell whatever product they want to sell for whatever price they want to sell it for, but ultimately the market will dictate what it is and people will have to charge less money for everything. Record companies have been overcharging people for way too long and now this is the trouble that they're in.","As soon as I got into music, I tried to be a working, real artist who gets paid for what he does, who doesn't have a day job.","I can remember back as far as age 8, performing with the Boston Folk Song Society. It was a Woody Guthrie song.","Some have called we rock and roll performers who never retire 'troubadours.' I enjoy this misnomer immensely. While there are many differences between me and my distant predecessors in L'Occitane, I do believe there is a lineage that connects us of the last 70 years with those romantic singers of the High Middle Ages."],"Frank Borman":["Exploration is really the essence of the human spirit.","Capitalism without bankruptcy is like Christianity without hell.","It's a vast, lonely, forbidding expanse of nothing rather like clouds and clouds of pumice stone. And it certainly does not appear to be a very inviting place to live or work."],"Frank Bruno":["Some people like going to the pub; I enjoy going to the gym.","Mental illness is a very powerful thing. If it is with you it is probably going to be there until the day you die. I am trying so hard to break mine, but it is not easy. It is my toughest fight ever.","Mental illness can happen to anybody. You can be a dustman, a politician, a Tesco worker... anyone. It could be your dad, your brother or your aunt.","Boxing is the toughest and loneliest sport in the world.","I want to stay healthy, keep fit, eat well, keep a low profile and be a good dad.","If you say you've had a nervous breakdown or things aren't right mentally, people run away from you. They think you're from 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,' you know.","My head has got regrets, but I haven't.","Sometimes your dreams come true.","I'm not really a cutter-off sort of person. I'll chat to anybody.","I didn't play a great deal of sport in primary school. It was not until I went away to boarding school in Sussex that I really got into sport.","I try and maintain a little bit of fitness, man.","I like going to the gym every day.","But when you actually go in the ring, it's a very lonely and scary place. It's just you and the other guy.","I ain't got no right to judge someone.","If you're not balanced, your mind's not balanced... my fuse went.","When I came into boxing, I brought it to the next level with adverts and doing pantomime and people just got jealous of me doing that.","I wouldn't mind getting emotionally involved with a woman.","I speak African. I can even speak Italian.","Journalists have always written that my mum said that I punched a hole through my cot when I was three years old. I don't remember doing that, and I think it was more that I was very energetic.","There's enough pressure in life without seeking competition. That makes it double pressure.","I still get invitations from all over Europe to speak at dinners, and it's an honour that promoters and charities can use me to create income.","I don't normally watch myself on the telly.","I am just working on staying alive.","When you're a man you try and be macho.","If your brain's not right they have good people at the NHS to help you fix it and talk to and counselling to calm you down and to focus you.","My trainer, George Francis, used to train a lot of African boxers. They're hungry guys, man. They've got no trainers, got nothing. They're so hungry to do boxing, to make some money.","Boxing is the toughest and loneliest sport in the world. You've got all the fans, lots of hangers-on jumping up and shouting different words. But when you actually go in the ring, it's a very lonely and scary place. It's just you and the other guy.","Being sectioned was the best thing that ever happened to me.","People need to have compassion for others.","Sometimes when you have bipolar you have days you are grumpy and not feeling yourself.","I still believe in marriage.","Boxing is a buzz, but I went into it to make a living. I wasn't going to go into the ring and get punched in the head for the fun of it.","People take the mickey out of mental health, but it is very delicate."],"Frank Butler":["I get a little behind during Lent, but it comes out even at Christmas.","Bishops are like umpires. You have to have them to call the close decisions.","The joy of giving is indeed a pleasure, especially when you get rid of something you don't want.","A golf course is nothing but a pool room moved outdoors.","When I was 18, I thought my father was pretty dumb. After a while when I got to be 21, I was amazed to find out how much he'd learned in three years."],"Frank Cady":["At 24, my head was as shiny as a cue ball on a billiard table. I naturally thought this meant curtains. Actually, I found it helped. When I was too young to play real character parts, they mistook me for older because of the bald noggin. I got juicy roles right from the start.","If you hang around long enough to show these people what you can do, you have a chance in this acting business."],"Frank Caliendo":["I love John Madden because he makes me feel smart.","ESPN takes itself very seriously, but for some reason, I'm allowed to be the court jester.","ESPN has so many characters, it's like 'The Simpsons.'","I was very stale at Fox. Much of it was my own fault. I was lazy and didn't fight for things I wanted to do at other times. Most of my stuff consisted of setup/punchline jokes to the camera - a very old-school approach. I was part of the establishment, I guess.","Fox does the NFL a lot like they program the rest of the network. There's sort of a locker room sense of humor that prevails. With ESPN, it's more like a pat-you-on-the-back kind of comedy. I mean, they'll all get on each other a little bit, but it's never mean-spirited.","With Twitter, it's a little harder to tell jokes that somebody hasn't heard already. You have all these people out there sharing their opinions and telling jokes in real time, and by the time you get on, somebody's already done some version of what you're trying to do.","I'm kind of the antithesis of a comedian. People that don't like me will agree with that.","I think sometimes comedians and entertainers and artists, sometimes they get onstage, and it's all for what they want to do. I think you still need to do stuff for the audience. They're the ones who are making it possible.","Most people want to be on TV as much as possible. I went up the ranks so fast because I was doing impressions, and nobody was really doing it when I started. I never got a chance to explore what's my comfort level onstage."],"Frank Capra":["I made mistakes in drama. I thought drama was when actors cried. But drama is when the audience cries.","Don't follow trends, start trends.","A hunch is creativity trying to tell you something.","Film is one of the three universal languages, the other two: mathematics and music.","Compassion is a two way street.","In our film profession you may have Gable's looks, Tracy's art, Marlene's legs or Liz's violet eyes, but they don't mean a thing without that swinging thing called courage.","My advice to young film-makers is this: don't follow trends, start them!","Whenever a situation develops to its extreme, it is bound to turn around and become its opposite.","If you want to send a message, try Western Union.","Scriptwriting is the toughest part of the whole racket... the least understood and the least noticed."],"Frank Carlucci":["And I argued with that intelligence estimate and I think it is a responsibility of policymakers to use their best judgment on the basis of the intelligence they've received.","And we ought to work our diplomacy first and I think it's a reason it's going to respond increasingly to our diplomacy particularly with the president's direct involvement in the peace process, and I think that's extraordinarily important.","The budget evolved from a management tool into an obstacle to management.","We would like to have friendly regimes with enough broad participation of their populations to maintain long-term stability, so that we would have not only access to the region's wealth, but we would be able to ensure the security of our good friend Israel.","We went into Iraq because Iraq posed a threat to the stability of the region and was engaged in the process of trying to develop weapons of mass destruction and had links to terrorists.","These are all elements, but the main thing we can do in the Middle East is encourage the reformist elements.","There's clearly something to be said for success and following through on your commitments.","The Crown Prince has said he needs to broaden political participation in the governing of Saudi Arabia.","So, I think even in Saudi Arabia there is movement. And we have to remember that over the years they've stabilized the oil price and that is tremendously important for the economies of the world. I think we have no choice but to work with the government of Saudi Arabia.","Putin has a lot at stake here and restoring the relationship with the United States, and there are already signs as Sandy mentioned that he's moving in the right direction to begin to ascertain that their trade with Iran is not used for the production of nuclear weapons.","Policymakers have to make judgments based on the best intelligence they get.","Over a period of time, I think the popular will in Iran will prevail.","Of course, China is a key to the North Korea if we're going to solve that riddle, but they could also be helpful on Iraq, which is why it's important that we maintain a constructive dialogue with China.","My understanding is that what was provided was general order of battle information, not operational intelligence. I certainly have no knowledge of US participation in preparing battle and strike packages and doubt strongly that that occurred.","Look at what the Omar of Qatar is doing, for example - the King of Morocco, Jordan, Bahrain. There are reform movements taking place, efforts to broaden the political participation of the populations of the region.","It took us 50 months in Germany, post World War II to go from the end of the war to a national election.","Intelligence is not a science.","I wouldn't even know - and I spent three years in the CIA - I wouldn't even know how you'd start a covert action program in a place like Iran. It would be extraordinarily difficult.","I think the real target of al-Qaeda is Saudi Arabia by the way. They hate us and we're a vehicle to get at Saudi Arabia. I think Osama bin Laden really wants to topple that regime and have his people move in, but that's a whole other story.","I can remember when I was National Security Adviser, the intelligence community told us... they put out an intelligence report saying that Iran would never back off from attacks on shipping in the Gulf if we use force.","But at the same time, I think we recognize we can't impose democracy from without, particularly American-style democracy. We need to work with those elements in the region that are moving towards a reformed process and there are a number of them."],"Frank Carson":["My wife said to me: 'If you won the lottery, would you still love me?' I said: 'Of course I would. I'd miss you, but I'd still love you.'","So I rang up British Telecom, I said 'I want to report a nuisance caller', he said 'Not you again'.","I don't think my wife likes me very much, when I had a heart attack she wrote for an ambulance.","What's the difference between my wife and a terrorist? You can negotiate with a terrorist.","People in Northern Ireland vote for their church, they don't vote with their heads; it is ridiculous.","Have you heard about the Irishman who reversed into a car boot sale and sold the engine?","I am accusing him of stealing my best material, he was a very funny man.","It's never occurred to me to worry about my health, or that I'll get old, or that people will stop laughing at me.","The thirties were troublesome in Belfast, and then of course there was no work for people, and it was terribly religiously divided.","My idea for peace in the Middle East is to go back to the 1966 line, but to build even more houses for the Palestinians, who are a poor people.","America has only 100 Senators for 309 million people, but Stormont has 108 members for 1.7 million.","Most of my jokes are racist - usually about the Irish."],"Frank Chodorov":["All wars come to an end, at least temporarily. But the authority acquired by the state hangs on; political power never abdicates.","When people say 'let's do something about it', they mean 'let's get hold of the political machinery so that we can do something to somebody else.' And that somebody is invariably you.","The pertinent question: if Americans did not want these wars should they have been compelled to fight them?","The State acquires power... and because of its insatiable lust for power it is incapable of giving up any of it. The State never abdicates."],"Frank Church":["The second is the damage to the credibility and independence of a free press which may be caused by covert relationships with the U.S. journalists and media organizations.","In examining the CIA's past and present use of the U.S. media, the Committee finds two reasons for concern. The first is the potential, inherent in covert media operations, for manipulating or incidentally misleading the American public."],"Frank Crane":["A good motto is: use friendliness but do not use your friends.","You may be deceived if you trust too much, but you will live in torment if you don't trust enough.","A friend is someone with whom you dare to be yourself.","Responsibility is the thing people dread most of all. Yet it is the one thing in the world that develops us, gives us manhood or womanhood fiber.","Habits are safer than rules; you don't have to watch them. And you don't have to keep them either. They keep you.","Next, in importance to books are their titles.","What is a friend? I will tell you... it is someone with whom you dare to be yourself.","Your sole contribution to the sum of things is yourself.","Most of the things we decide are not what we know to be the best. We say yes, merely because we are driven into a corner and must say something.","You are wise, witty and wonderful, but you spend too much time reading this sort of stuff.","You do not succeed because you do not know what you want, but because you don't want it intensely enough."],"Frank Crowninshield":["Young men and young women, full of courage, originality, and genius, are everywhere to be met with.","Let us instance one respect in which American life has recently undergone a great change. We allude to its increased devotion to pleasure, to happiness, to dancing, to sport... to the delights of the country, to laughter, and to all forms of cheerfulness.","For women, we intend to do something in a noble and missionary spirit... We mean to appeal to their intellects... and we hereby announce ourselves as determined and bigoted feminists.","What Marie Antoinette was to eighteenth-century France, Mary Pickford is to twentieth-century America.","In my day, when you called on a girl, her mother was always hollering down to see if she was still unraped, the maid would look in, her father would shuffle his feet in another room. Today the boy calls up, says, 'Meet you at the back door of Stern's.'","My sense of loneliness was not particularly great until I reached sixty. From that time on, I would have given an ex-king's ransom if I had been able, in my youth to seduce a lady into thinking of me as a handyman and provider around the house.","I have never collected an object or figure from Africa or Oceania because of anything curious about it or because of its utility or historic interest. Everything has been chosen entirely because of its aesthetic significance; its form, feeling, structure, and plastic values.","My interest in society - at times so pronounced that the word 'snob' comes a little to mind - derives from the fact that I like an immense number of things which society, money, and position bring in their train: painting, tapestries, rare books, smart dresses, dances, gardens, country houses, correct cuisine, and pretty women.","We Americans are mildly interested, of course, in reading about the discovery of radium by Madame Curie, but what we really yearn to know is the name of the uncommemorated French female who first mixed a sauce bearnaise."],"Frank D. Gilroy":["I'd like to walk into a room sometime and be introduced as the author of something other than that play. There's always one thing in a career that has more impact than anything else. In my case, 'The Subject Was Roses' was that thing.","I remember how I would wait for a play idea. I wasted a tremendous amount of time. I didn't realize that ideas could be made into movies or novels.","I don't believe in updating. If a play works, it draws something from being true to its time.","You reach a time... when fact and fiction blend seamlessly. If you do it too soon, it's journalism. If you do it too late, you forget, and it's fantasy. There's an optimum time.","Young men who have been away, been to war, they are different when they come home.","The way plays happen, at least with me, it's spontaneous combustion of things you've had in your head.","I think of myself as a storyteller.","You're looking at a guy who has no reason to complain about anything."],"Frank Dane":["Time is money, especially when you are talking to a lawyer or buying a commercial.","A liberal is a man who will give away everything he doesn't own.","The way to a woman's heart is through your wallet.","Life is strange. Every so often a good man wins.","Nothing annoys a woman more than to have company drop in unexpectedly and find the house looking as it usually does.","Blessed is he who talks in circles, for he shall become a big wheel.","Get all the fools on your side and you can be elected to anything.","Rome had Senators too, that's why it declined.","Some have greatness thrust upon them, but not lately.","Preachers denounce sin as if it was available to everyone.","A conservative is a fellow who thinks a rich man should have a square deal.","The news of any politician's death should be listed under 'Public Improvements.'","It is not necessary to have enemies if you go out of your way to make friends hate you.","In polite society one laughs at all the jokes, including the ones one has heard before.","Ignorance is never out of style. It was in fashion yesterday, it is the rage today and it will set the pace tomorrow."],"Frank Darabont":["I think a story should take as long to tell as it is appropriate to that particular story.","To me, length is an artificial and arbitrary factor in a film.","Visual storytelling of one kind or another has been around since cavemen were drawing on the walls.","Some of us have great original ideas and some of us depend on adaptations.","A director shouldn't get in the way of the movie, the story should.","I think once you've finished a movie you really have to detach from it so that you can come back and watch it as an audience member.","I am fascinated with times past.","Boy, I'd hate to shoot on tape or disc or whatever the hell they're talking about. I love film.","And I don't think I'm giving away any secrets here, but there are a lot of terrible scripts in this town.","The human race is fundamentally insane. If you put two of us into a room together, we're soon gonna start figuring out good reasons to kill one another.","The only person who can, with impunity, make the movie he wants to make, has got to be Steven Spielberg.","Stanley Kubrick was a big inspiration. People accuse me of never using my own material. But when did Kubrick? You look at his films and they are completely unique... completely separate entities.","I'd like to think that my films are personal enough to exist without hearkening back to their respective novels.","One of my favorite movies of all time is 'It's A Wonderful Life,' which is a pretty interesting choice for a seasonal Christmas favorite, because it's about a guy who wants to commit suicide and is presented with reasons not to.","'The Exorcist' is amazing because it recognizes that silences can be as powerful as sound effects.","I spent 20 years of my career primarily being a writer for hire."],"Frank Deford":["Thank you for listening. Thank you for abiding me. And now, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, children of all ages, I bid you goodbye and take my leave.","You have to do what the market requires of you... You either keep swimming, or you sink.","I get very envious of my general news colleagues who are always being handed sexy new stuff like global warming, China, and Donald Trump, while my sports colleagues and I must be eternally satisfied with the same old home-court advantage, soccer, and momentum.","The Masters is not greedy. You wanna buy a Masters souvenir logo shirt? Sure, let's go over to the nearest Ralph Lauren boutique. Oops, you can only purchase Masters memorabilia at the Masters, this one week of the year.","Majesty is a thing of beauty to behold, whatever the particular enterprise.","In days of yore, Opening Day of the baseball season was special, signifying that spring had come at last. Today, however, Opening Day sort of dribbles into existence, and the spiritual start of spring now belongs to the Masters golf tournament, where the azaleas and magnolias and dogwood bloom.","I have survived so long because I've been blessed with talented and gracious colleagues and with a top brass who let me choose my topics every week and then allowed me to express opinions that were not always popular. Well, someone had to stand up to the yackety-yak soccer cult.","She glances at the photo, and the pilot light of memory flickers in her eyes.","When I was covering games, and this is back in the '60s, you'd go into the manager's office. I can still visualize Earl Weaver from the Baltimore Orioles. I can just see Earl now in his underwear... with a beer in one hand and a cigarette in the other, holding court. And that was the way it was done then.","By coincidence, this particular tiny show on earth that consists entirely of me talking about sports on NPR is also folding its tent flaps this May of 2017. Yes, this is my swansong, my farewell, my last hurrah. Adieu, adios, arrivederci, auf wiedersehen.","Remember when John Roberts was seeking confirmation of the Supreme Court, and he said judges should be just like umpires, just calling balls and strikes? Well, turnabout is fair play. What baseball needs behind the plate are umpires like those judges who are called strict constructionists, which means you follow subtle law to the letter.","You can tell all you need to about a society from how it treats animals and beaches.","In the television era, the second week of the Olympics is reserved for what is considered the marquee event: track and field.","Because I lost a daughter, eight years old, to cystic fibrosis, I think that anytime that I'm dealing with people who, like Andrea Yeager, are trying to help those sick children, I identify very much with them.","Quickness and momentum. You take the whole last generation of sports, listening to them, even reading about them, watching the games, analyzing them, arguing about them, instant-replaying them, second-guessing them, and all you'll distill from them is quickness and momentum.","Football teams represent cities and colleges and schools. The people have built great stadiums, and the game is culturally intertwined with our calendar. We don't go back to college for the college. We go back for a football game, and, yes, we even call that 'homecoming.'","So much about big-time college sports is criticized. But the worst scandal is almost never mentioned: the academic fraud wherein the student-athletes, so-called, are admitted without even remotely adequate credentials and then aren't educated so much as they are just kept eligible.","To compare writing an article for 'Sports Illustrated' to doing a piece for 'Real Sports', the article, it was all me. You know, I'm out there by myself with my pad and pencil. 'Real Sports,' I've got a producer, an assistant producer, and cameramen. It's an individual game versus a team game.","That's the greatest compliment I can get: when somebody from Key West says, 'Hey, Bubba.' That means I'm in!","I am something of a ham. Yeah, I'd always been a writer. But in high school, I acted in plays. So it wasn't as if you had to drag the words out of my vocal chords.","If I come on three days after the Super Bowl and say pretty much what everybody else has said, what's the point? That was the tricky thing... coming up with a new angle every time - or most times, because you couldn't bat a thousand.","If I'd grown up in Sao Paulo, I'm sure I would've been a great soccer fan.","I don't think there are many kids who sit around and want to be actors. I don't think there are many kids who want to sit around and want to be senators. But so many of us want to be athletes, so we're envious of them, and we put them up on that pedestal.","I think we have enough trouble finding community in this country, and sport does provide that. It is a mediocrisy, the greatest mediocrisy. If you're the best, it shows in sports. Nobody can say, 'Well, he's only there because of his connections,' or whatever. In that sense, I suppose it upholds democracy and the best in us.","Every now and then, I get a free ticket from someone, and I look at the price, and it says $800, and I'm thinking, 'A thousand dollars to see,' I said, 'There's no ballgame in the world worth that kind of money,' and yet the attendance for sports is more than it ever has been.","I remember, when I was growing up in Baltimore, we'd get on a streetcar and go down to see the Orioles, and for a couple of bucks, you could get a pretty good seat. Kids can't do that anymore. So I think that changes the whole nature of sports.","I've been delivering these little homilies since 1980 - that's 37 years - and altogether, NPR statisticians tell me, my bloviation total is 1,656 commentaries - and I trust you've hung onto every word.","Johnny U was an American original, a piece of work like none other, excepting maybe Paul Bunyan and Horatio Alger.","Nowadays, of course, flesh peddlers and scouting services identify the best athletes when they are still in junior high. Prospects are not allowed to sneak up on us.","Before the Colts arrived in 1947, the best athlete in town was a woman duckpin bowler named Toots Barger. Football? The biggest games in Baltimore had been when Johns Hopkins took on Susquehanna or Franklin & Marshall at homecoming.","I never saw war, so that is still my vision of manhood: Unitas standing courageously in the pocket, his left arm flung out in a diagonal to the upper deck, his right cocked for the business of passing, down amidst the mortals. Lock and load.","I think I would die if I couldn't get to the typewriter every day. I really need that.","I think the best thing I've written is a story called 'The Boxer and the Blonde.' It's a piece about Billy Conn, the white would-be heavyweight champion of the world, who lived in Pittsburgh.","ESPN is all meat and potatoes. It's pretty much scouting reports. There isn't a great deal of humor, and when there is, it's pretty sophomoric.","There are some books that get huge numbers of positive reviews, but reading them satiates people. They say, 'I've read enough now'.","I'll forever be grateful to NPR that they gave me such extraordinary freedom... It was 37 years of a fond relationship.","Nothing made me happier than to hear from literally hundreds of listeners who would tell me how much the commentaries revealed about a subject they otherwise had never cared much for.","Sport is an art: it has incredible appeal everywhere on this earth, and it fills so many human hearts with passion that it's impossible to dismiss.","The wonderful thing about delivering sports commentary on NPR was that because it has such a broad audience, I was able to reach people who otherwise had little or no interest in sport - especially as an important part of our human culture.","The dollar is a winner. The euro is a tie. Get off the dime, Europe, and play to win.","The hardest thing in the world is to write something critical about someone and then show up the next day in the locker room. I mean, that is not fun, and that takes an awful lot of guts. And I never enjoyed that.","I remember one time I wrote something very, very critical about Wilt Chamberlain. The next time I saw him - and Wilt was not a man, as huge as he was - he was not a man of confrontation. And we were in the Lakers locker room. And he sent Jerry West over, and he said, 'Frank, Wilt would like you to leave.'","What we accepted as great art - whether the book, the script, the painting, the symphony - is that which could be saved and savored. But the performances of the athletic artists who ran and jumped and wrestled were gone with the wind.","How did females become 'guys?' How did everyone become 'guys?' Remember, too, that a male guy was something of a scoundrel. And a wise guy was a fresh kid, a whippersnapper. In its most other famous evocation, men in Brooklyn said 'youse guys.' Damon Runyon referred to hustlers, gamblers, and other nefarious types as guys.","NPR allowed me to treat sports seriously, as another branch on the tree of culture.","You're writing about young, vibrant people; there are wins and losses. In other words, it's great drama.","I think, in accepting the amount of money that athletes make, I think that fans accept that now. It's the nature of the beast; that's the way it is, so they understand it. All, I think, fans have changed - because the price of tickets has gone up so much - that they feel a certain sense of entitlement when they go to a game.","To write long pieces - or not even long pieces - to write stuff like the columns of Red Smith and people like that - they're different then what it is today. Everything today is based on x's and o's. Inside baseball, it's all, 'Who's gonna win?' or you're comparing things - it's not as thoughtful as it used to be.","Once again it is peaceful at Augusta National Golf Club, after some rather ugly stand-offs in recent years, when the club balked at changing its all-white, all-male membership tradition. African-Americans and female Americans are on the club manifest now along with other golf-Americans, and all is serene once again.","Yes, the Masters is too stylish to be an American icon. It's as out of character for Uncle Sam as a McDonald's is for France.","Despite the fact that every sport this side of badminton worries about concussions that result in brain damage, CTE, the National Hockey League refuses to accept the overwhelming medical science. Good grief - the NHL still permits fights.","The strike zone should be what the rule book says it is and not a personal idiosyncrasy.","If there ever was an 'America's team,' it would be itty-bitty, little Green Bay, stuck way up there somewhere, owned by the salt-of-the-Earth citizens themselves.","The Cowboys were never America's team any more than Anthony Weiner was America's congressman.","It's still the tradition for various football powerhouses to pay guarantees to schools with cream-puff teams to come on over to our place and submit to massacre.","It's interesting too, that the coach of that Georgia Tech team who led his valiant warriors to those 222 points was none other than John Heisman. Yes, he whom the Heisman trophy is named for, an award that honors that college player who best exemplifies excellence and integrity.","As it happens, Cumberland was on the verge of bankruptcy and had to give up football. But the villainous Heisman made it play a game that had been scheduled when Cumberland still had a team, or Heisman threatened to demand a $3,000 forfeiture fee that could well have put the school out of existence.","Since too few Americans go to the polls, I say what this country needs is a bobblehead election, where voters will get free bobblehead dolls of their choice when they show up and vote for president.","I think the four major leagues ought to set up a joint commission - say, of retired judges - to rule on athletes who are accused of doing bad things away from the game. Then each league would retain its independence in determining what penalties their players should get for infractions committed within the sport.","All sorts of famous sports people have been suspended for extended periods.","While swimming was always a spotlight sport, I was, if you will, sort of present at the creation when gymnastics became the new star lead-off hitter.","Statues of sports stars are all the rage - especially in baseball.","Pete Rose may not make the Hall of Fame, but a statue of him is going to be erected outside the Cincinnati Reds ballpark.","On Monument Avenue in Richmond, Va., there are statues of five Confederate luminaries and then, incongruously in this company, one of Arthur Ashe.","It's fascinating, isn't it, that whereas so many of our statues have been of military leaders, now it may well be sports stars who are the ones more likely to be so honored.","Does each of us need to suffer agony to understand how brutal our gridiron entertainment is? Surely, seeing is believing enough. So, what is football doing to us as a people? How do we explain an America that alone in the world so loves this savage sport?","Don't dismiss Auriemma and UConn just because their excellence shines on the female side of the coin.","We exalted that Michael Phelps-consecrated water. Rose petals were strewn in Peyton Manning's path when he retired. But hey, that's natural. As we should, we admire those in any craft, no less so in sports, who appear out of nowhere to achieve remarkable feats.","It was not that long ago when the accepted wisdom in football was that the running game had to be established - that was always the obligatory verb: established - before passes could become effective. My, we know how that has changed. Now the pass is established from the get-go, and running is an afterthought.","At all levels - with men and women - the 3-point shot has utterly transformed the way the game is played. More and more, the players are spread out, looking to pop behind the 3-point arc.","More and more teams are, in the vernacular, 'going small,' with only one big man down deep. Good grief, the position of power forward is in the process of going the way of short shorts.","Owners own teams so that they might move them to another municipality with better luxury boxes.","The Tigers, Lions, Red Wings, and Pistons are there today as sure as they were when what was good for General Motors was good for the country. Would you rather have a basketball team, or would you rather be Detroit?","I do honestly believe that, in the 21st century, sport is the most significant cultural element in this imperfect world. It calls for serious attention.","When Juan Antonio Samaranch said the Olympics are more important than the Catholic Church, I just couldn't believe it. I said to myself, 'Don't let your expression show that he has just made a total ass of himself. Be cool, and just keep right on talking.'","I think every time I can find a story that touches that human nerve, and even sometimes makes you cry, I think that I've found something that I'll like very much.","If you're a father of a child who dies, it's an experience that never leaves you. It scars you forever and ever and ever. And so when I do any kind of story with somebody who's in the same position as my daughter was, there's no question that something comes out of me and embraces that story in a way that only a father who lost a child could.","You can stand at a bar and scream all you want about who was the greatest athlete and which was the greatest sports dynasty, and you can shout out your precious statistics, and maybe you're right, and maybe the red-faced guy down the bar - the one with the foam on his beer and the fancy computer rankings - is right, but nobody really knows.","The only thing we know for sure about superiority in sports in the United States of America in the 20th century is that Bill Russell and the Boston Celtics teams he led stand alone as the ultimate winners.","Bill Russell was the pivot on which the whole sport turned.","The year after Russell retired, in the famous seventh game of the NBA Finals at Madison Square Garden, Willis Reed, the New York Knicks center, limped onto the court against the Los Angeles Lakers, inspiring his team and freezing Chamberlain into a benign perplexity.","First and foremost, Howard Cosell is sports. There are all these people, these fans, who claim that when Cosell does a game on television, they turn off the sound on the TV and listen to the radio broadcast. Oh, sure. You probably know critics in your neighborhood who vow the same thing. Well, too bad for them.","'Good Morning America' is television to a fare-thee-well.","Dan Rather pulling on a sweater and thereby winning a whole new chunk of the populace: That's television. President Reagan's press conferences: That's television. Keith Jackson is television. So are Kermit the Frog, instant replay, and the Fiesta Bowl.","The stories that are most unfamiliar, the ones that seem to come out of the blue about people that aren't well known, usually come from producers that have really done a lot of homework and looked around. Other stories come from the correspondents.","I'm a writer. I'm moonlighting on television. I never made any pretensions to that. As much as I like being on 'Real Sports,' I have been a writer since I was a little boy, and that's still my first love.","People often lump radio and television together because they are both broadcast mediums. But radio, anyway, and the radio I do for NPR, is much closer to writing than it is to television.","It costs a lot of money to deliver newsprint. It's so much easier to do it through the air, Internet, radio, television. The second easiest thing is to do it through the mail. But when you have to take something heavy and put it on someone's doorstep, that costs a lot of money.","There were a lot of places, including Los Angeles, that didn't have major league baseball. There were other really large cities that had no major league teams, but at least they had college football.","I can remember going to see the minor league Orioles. Until I was 15 years old, we'd go down with 3,000 people to watch them play the Syracuse Chiefs or the Jersey City Little Giants. That's what passed for Baltimore sports.","It's almost impossible to explain how little the NBA amounted to when I started covering it in 1963. It wasn't fair to call it bush, although everybody did. It was simply small - only nine teams - and insignificant.","In the summer of 1963, my second with 'Sports Illustrated,' Jerry Tax, the basketball editor, got the Celtics' Frank Ramsey, the NBA's first famous sixth man, to do a piece for the magazine revealing some of the devious little tricks of his trade. Things like surreptitiously holding an opponent's shorts - nickel-and-dime stuff.","Several NBA teams got their best gates every season when they scheduled a doubleheader and booked the Globetrotters and their stooges for the opening game.","The NBA Schedule was made up by one man, Eddie Gottlieb, who had owned the Philadelphia Warriors. Eddie had a Buddha-like body and a crinkly smile, and because he had also been an owner in baseball's old Negro leagues, he was known as the Mogul.","I had gone to work for 'Newsweek', left 'Newsweek' and went to work for 'Vanity Fair,' and then went back to 'Newsweek'. I came back to 'SI' as a contract writer.","Hard as it is to believe, there were three magazines fighting over me. 'Newsweek' wanted to keep me, 'ESPN The Magazine' was coming into existence and wanted me, and 'SI' wanted to bring me back. Isn't that amazing? I had a choice, like a free agent.","'SI' came to me and said, 'We want you to do a story on Russell as the greatest team player,' which I certainly agreed with.","I think there are more good sportswriters doing more good sportswriting than ever before. But I also believe that the one thing that's largely gone out is what made sport such fertile literary territory - the characters, the tales, the humor, the pain, what Hollywood calls 'the arc.'","We start 2016 with a command: that the subject of Pete Rose and the Hall of Fame is over, finis, kaput forever and ever. As sure as we will no longer discuss whether Lindsey Graham or George Pataki can be president."],"Frank Delaney":["To understand and reconnect with our stories, the stories of the ancestors, is to build our identities.","We all belong to an ancient identity. Stories are the rivers that take us there.","Kitchens are for conversation. They're not just for cooking; they're for conversations.","'The Great Gatsby,' by F. Scott Fitzgerald, remains the most perfect novel that has ever come out of the United States. Everything in the book moves as it should, in the manner of a piece by Bach or Mozart.","For a startling period of my life, I reported the Troubles in Ireland for the BBC. I lived in Dublin and was called out to all sorts of incidents that, if taken together, add up to a war - bombings, assassinations, riots, shootings, robberies, jailbreaks, kidnappings, and sieges.","As an arts journalist in London, working mainly for the BBC, I interviewed hundreds if not thousands of authors. From them I gleaned a great deal of passing instruction in writing and I observed one fascinating detail: no two writers approach their work - physically - in the same way.","Writers have opinions - that, in part, is why they write. Therefore they have strong likes and dislikes.","I'd have to struggle to find a subject in which I can't get some kind of interested pulse started.","If you ever want to understand multitasking in prose, James Joyce is your man.","If you have a book, you have a friend.","Storytelling, in print or speech, needs vital energy.","If you need proof of how the oral relates to the written, consider that many great novelists, including Joyce and Hemingway, never submitted a piece of work without reading it aloud.","I write - and then I write some more.","First a piece of Irish wisdom: you should always listen to a bookie. For they have a saying, 'Money tells a good story,' and somewhere in their odds is a kind of science-fiction existentialism that decrees that we, the people, know everything. In other words, betting patterns often make for good, unconscious soothsaying."],"Frank Dillane":["Being homeless is like living in a post-apocalyptic world. You're on the outskirts of society.","My old man, he's done it very differently from me. He had years of honing his craft and years of doing all that stuff before he even had to worry about 'Game of Thrones.' So he's absolutely established himself as an actor without the fear of having to have a personality as well.","I don't know how consciously anyone looks for a father figure.","Theatre's a whole different beast to film. It requires a lot more of you.","I'm sure there will come a time when I won't be able to, you know, walk around so easy sometimes, or it's just things that I don't necessarily want. I don't really necessarily want to be famous.","The world is ending, make no mistake. It's coming to an end. This can't go on for much longer. Capitalism has to fall.","We're coming to the peak, I think soon, before we have to come back to, like, humanity. Humanity needs to look, and it hasn't been looking for so long.","I've had to wean myself away to make sure that any choices I make are grounded in myself rather than the seeking of approval.","You don't realize until afterwards that if you feed the subconscious, it will bleed into your everyday life.","I remember, when they started remaking 'Star Wars,' the fury that surrounded that whole thing, and, 'How dare they?' But now, that's just a common denominator.","People are going to keep making stuff. Things are going to be spin-offs.","I had a dream. I dreamed I was on this island, and there were two hotels, and one hotel was filled with dead people, and the other one wasn't, and I was in the hotel full of dead people.","Dialect was my biggest fear. So, I spent a long time working with dialect coaches just trying to get American down. I think it's very important and very easy to misinterpret.","I don't drive.","My father is such an amazing, beautiful actor. He's incredible, and he helps me a lot.","Harry Potter was my first job.","Although I grew up around movies, I don't know that I assumed I was going to be an actor.","'Candida' was difficult: stimulating but very wordy."],"Frank Dobson":["I don't think we can go into important local elections next year... with Tony Blair as leader and expect to keep many of the councillors we've got now.","All businessmen are scum.","The present system of protecting NHS patients was a bit of a shambles.","I am not against Muslim schools. But as I believe in integration, I think we would be better off overall if we did not have denominational schools at all.","Smoking is the now the principal avoidable cause of premature death in Britain. It hits the worst off people hardest of all. Smoking is one of the principal causes of the health gap which leads to poorer people being ill more often and dying sooner.","There are alternate definitions of manhood in the West.","I think I've had a very privileged life.","My own view is that if you filled every member of the parliamentary Labour party with a truth drug and lashed them to a polygraph lie detector, very, very few of them would support foundation hospitals.","If you say someone is thrilled, it implies talk of an exciting project. I'm wary of such talk.","It is more important for Labour to raise the reputation of politics than for the Tories, who are only in politics for the money."],"Frank Drake":["It now appears that essentially every star has a planetary system. In the very beginning, we thought at best half.","While NASA talks about 'Are we alone?' as a number one question, they are putting zero money into searching for intelligent life. There's a big disconnect there.","The story seems to be that almost every star has a planetary system... and, also, the definition of 'habitable zone' has expanded. In our system, it used to be that only Mars and Earth were potentially habitable. Now we've got an ocean on Europa... Titan.","In 1957, I was studying the Pleiades star cluster at Harvard University's radio observatory. On one occasion, we saw an added feature in the data. It turned out to be an amateur radio enthusiast near the observatory, but at the time, I thought we had detected clear evidence of another civilisation.","There was a magic about pulsars... no other things in the sky had such labels on them. Each one had its own distinct pulsing frequency, so it could be identified by anybody, including other creatures, after a long period of time and far, far away.","Nature never uses prime numbers. But mathematicians do.","We send messages all the time, free of charge. There's a big shell out there now, 80 light-years around us. A civilization only a little more advanced than we are can pick those things up.","If you're sending a message to extraterrestrials, what you want to send is what's special about us and our planet - what is unusual. Now, that's not basic chemistry or mineralogy; it's pretty much the cultural stuff and the consequences of evolution.","The pulsar map is not dangerous at all. It will likely never even be seen by extraterrestrials.","No company is hiring anyone to search for messages from aliens. Most people don't seem to think there's much benefit to it. The lack of interest is, I think, because most people don't realize what even a simple detection would really mean.","Right now, there could well be messages from the stars flying right through this room. Through you and me. And if we had the right receiver set up properly, we could detect them. I still get chills thinking about it.","People presume we've been somehow monitoring the entire sky at all frequencies, all the time, but we haven't yet been able to do any of those things. The fact is, all the SETI efforts to date have only closely examined a couple thousand nearby stars, and we're only just now learning which of those might have promising planets."],"Frank Frazetta":["I hope my work has inspired young artists. I have always tried to maintain my freedom as an artist and I feel it is one of the main reasons I have been successful.","What I do is create images, period.","By the time I was a teenager, I knew I wanted to be an artist. I was a born draftsman and liked all forms of art, so I just knew that's what I wanted to do.","When it came to my art, I went my own way and did not follow the trends."],"Frank Gaffney":["History demonstrates that previous military drawdowns invited aggression by our enemies. After World War I, America drew down forces until the U.S. Army had fewer than 100,000 men in uniform. That weakness invited Nazi aggression in Europe and the imperial Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor.","After America won the Cold War, some believed we had come to the 'end of history,' and budget-cutters celebrated the so-called 'peace dividend.' As a result, we ignored the toxic mixture of militant Islam and terror that ultimately led to 9/11.","Too many countries that do not play by the free trade rules of the World Trade Organization - including, notably mercantilist China and monopolist Saudi Arabia - have been allowed in, to the detriment of both the WTO and the liberal trading environment it is supposed to sponsor.","The most desirable aspects of the Law of the Sea Treaty pertain to navigational rights.","One of the most important post-9/11 efforts made to counter terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction is President Bush's Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI).","). Dozens of nations have agreed to join in monitoring and, if necessary, intercepting and boarding ships on the high seas in the event they are suspected of engaging in one or both of these threatening activities.","If the area were on or near the U.S. continental shelf, such data could well provide an enemy with strategically invaluable insights into undersea access routes that could be used to attack some of the millions of Americans who live on or near our coasts.","The United Nations has long sought the ability to raise revenues in this manner as a means of reducing its reliance on American and other member nations' dues to sustain the UN's operations.","The more we are consuming oil that either comes from places that are bent on our destruction or helping those who are... the more we are enabling those who are trying to kill us.","The object of China's strategy is inexorably to supplant the United States as the world's premier economic power, and if necessary, to defeat us militarily.","I don't believe there is such a thing as a moderate Islamist party. The challenge with Islamists is that they seek to impose what they call Sharia on everybody, Muslim and non-Muslim alike.","After all, from the Muslim Brotherhood's inception in Egypt in 1928, it has been a revolutionary organization committed to the imposition worldwide of a totalitarian, supremacist Islamic doctrine they call shariah.","Sharia has become an increasingly significant force in American capitalism, thanks to the embrace by Wall Street and the U.S. government of so-called Sharia-Compliant Finance. Indeed, this country's taxpayers now own the largest purveyor of sharia-compliant insurance products in the world: AIG.","Sharia is the impetus behind multinational diplomatic efforts to accommodate Sharia blasphemy prohibitions on expression that offends Muslims.","Since the presidency of Ronald Reagan, conservatives have succeeded by adhering to a platform that rests firmly on three legs: smaller government, faith and family, and a strong national defense. These three legs do not merely represent a political coalition; they are three necessary components of a strong and secure America.","Most Americans will be horrified that President Obama is compromising our deterrent to chemical and biological attacks on this country. Our allies will also be troubled by his aspiration to eliminate U.S. tactical nuclear weapons in Europe.","Boone Pickens should be commended for his leadership on American energy security, and for bringing Ted Turner along on some sensible approaches to enhancing it.","Unfortunately, the cyber threat to 'the grid' is only one means of eviscerating the soft underbelly of American society. Another which has been getting increasing attention could be delivered via the kind of nuclear-armed ballistic missile that Iran and North Korea have been developing: a strategic electro-magnetic pulse attack.","It is one of the truisms of politics that a conservative is often enough a former liberal who has been 'mugged by reality.'","Unbeknownst to most American investors, significant portions of their public pension, mutual fund, life insurance and private portfolios are comprised of stocks of privately held companies that partner with state sponsors of terror.","To his lasting credit, President Reagan never wavered. He recognized the strategic importance of staying the course, both in terms of denying Moscow the military hegemony it sought in Western Europe and of restoring the will, cohesiveness, and security of the NATO alliance, so badly frayed during the turbulent 1970s.","Having worked for him in the nuclear weapons policy business, I can tell you that President Reagan was committed to assuring the effectiveness of our nuclear deterrent.","But I really believe it is in America's interest as well as that of the free world more generally to stop Iran from getting its hands on nuclear weapons. This regime has threatened to wipe Israel off the map and bring about a world without America, and either of those is a really bad prospect.","Ever since taking office, the Obama administration has sought to accommodate Islamist demands that freedom of expression be curbed, lest it offend Muslims and stoke violence. For example, in 2009, the administration co-sponsored a United Nations Human Rights Council resolution along those lines."],"Frank Gehry":["Architecture should speak of its time and place, but yearn for timelessness.","Architecture has always been a very idealistic profession. It's about making the world a better place, and it works over the generations because people go on vacation and they look for it.","I think people care. If not, why do so many people spend money going on vacations to see architecture? They go to the Parthenon, to Chartres, to the Sydney Opera House. They go to Bilbao... Something compels them, and yet we live surrounded by everything but great architecture.","I don't want to do architecture that's dry and dull.","I used to sketch - that's the way I thought out loud. Then they made a book of my sketches, and I got self-conscious, so now I don't do it much.","You've got to bumble forward into the unknown.","It's not new that architecture can profoundly affect a place, sometimes transform it. Architecture and any art can transform a person, even save someone.","The best advice I've received is to be yourself. The best artists do that.","An architect is given a program, budget, place, and schedule. Sometimes the end product rises to art - or at least people call it that.","I make a model of the site. There are some obvious things: where the entrance should be, where the cars have to go in. You start to get the scale of it. You understand the client's needs, and what the client is hoping for and yearning for.","I don't know how to overcome this perception that I'm extravagant.","One of my greatest influences is the Italian artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini.","My buildings are all on budget.","Most of our cities built since the war are bland. They're modernist, they're cold, and now architects want to go back to that.","A lot of people don't get it, but I design from the inside out so that the finished product looks inevitable somehow. I think it's important to create spaces that people like to be in, that are humanistic.","You have freedom, so you have to make choices - and at the point when I make a choice, the building starts to look like a Frank Gehry building. It's a signature.","Chicago's one of the rare places where architecture is more visible.","If I knew where I was going, I wouldn't do it. When I can predict or plan it, I don't do it.","And I realized, when I'd come in to the meetings with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff, and people would just look at me like I'd just landed from Mars. But I couldn't do anything else. That was my response to the people and the time.","For me, every day is a new thing. I approach each project with a new insecurity, almost like the first project I ever did. And I get the sweats. I go in and start working, I'm not sure where I'm going. If I knew where I was going I wouldn't do it.","There are a lot of questions about whether architecture is art. The people who ask that think pretty tract houses are architecture. But that doesn't hold up.","I have always thought that L.A. is a motor city that developed linear downtowns.","A well-designed home has to be very comfortable. I can't stand the aesthetes, the minimal thing. I can't live that way. My home has to be filled with stuff - mostly paintings, sculpture, my fish lamps, cardboard furniture, lots of books.","Liquid architecture. It's like jazz - you improvise, you work together, you play off each other, you make something, they make something. And I think it's a way of - for me, it's a way of trying to understand the city, and what might happen in the city.","I would like to make a building as intellectually driven as it is sculptural and as positive as it would be acceptable to hope.","There are people who design buildings that are not technically and financially good, and there are those who do. Two categories - simple.","The fact is I'm an opportunist. I'll take materials around me, materials on my table, and work with them as I'm searching for an idea that works.","I promised a lot of people I'd slow down when I turned 80.","Some people may say my curved panels look like sails. Well, I am a sailor, so I guess I probably do use that metaphor in my work - though not consciously.","When I was a kid, my father didn't really have much hope for me. He thought I was a dreamer; he didn't think I would amount to anything. My mother also.","There is stuff I would have liked to have done. But there are no sour grapes.","Democracy, obviously, is something we don't want to give up, but it does create chaos. It means the guy next door can do what he wants, and it creates a collision of thinking. In cities, that means people build whatever they want.","The game is if the orchestra can hear each other, they play better. If they play better and there's a tangible feeling between the orchestra and the audience, if they feel each other, the audience responds and the orchestra feels it.","Look, architecture has a lot of places to hide behind, a lot of excuses. 'The client made me do this.' 'The city made me do this.' 'Oh, the budget.' I don't believe that anymore.","There is a backlash against me and everyone who has done buildings that have movement and feeling.","I don't think all buildings have to be iconic, but the history of the world has shown us that cultures build iconic buildings for their major public buildings.","Green issues have been used as a marketing tool. Sometimes these green claims are completely meaningless.","On certain projects, on big public projects, people definitely are interested in making them greener, but on smaller projects with tight budgets it can be harder.","I'm a leftie, and I've always believed in doing things on a modest scale.","Architecture is a service business. An architect is given a program, budget, place, and schedule. Sometimes the end product rises to art - or at least people call it that.","Each project, I suffer like I'm starting over again in life. There's a lot of healthy insecurity that fuels this stuff.","Well, I've always just - I've never really gone out looking for work. I always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head.","I approach each project with a new insecurity, almost like the first project I ever did, and I get the sweats, I go in and start working, I'm not sure where I'm going.","I work from the inside out.","This neo-minimalism super cold stuff is weird to me. I need a place where I can come home and take my shoes off.","I think my attitudes about the past are very traditional. You can't ignore history; you can't escape it even if you want to. You might as well know where you come from, and you might as well know that everything has been done in some shape or form.","When I went to Harvard and studied planning, I found I didn't have the skills or the strength to become the kind of public person who could go out and lobby government agencies.","I don't make things with my hands, although I studied woodworking and made furniture.","I can't just decide myself what's being built. Someone decides what they want, then I work for them.","I never said I was opposed to the LEED program or to green building - I'm not.","I was in Peru and visited a building near Lima built by the Incas. It was low in height, with no windows at all, but all the way in the back there was air movement. And I couldn't figure out how they'd done it; it was incredible.","My father was an urchin that lived in Hell's Kitchen. He was part of a family of nine. I mean, there were times that were better and worse, but mostly, by the time we got to L.A., they'd lost whatever they had. And it was a sad time. And both he and I became truck drivers for different companies.","My father probably - he had flashes of creativity - he used to do store windows for fruit stores that he worked in and stuff.","My only extravagance in life is my sailboat. I'm bonkers about that, but other than that, I don't spend money on myself.","I refuse to work unless I get paid, so I don't get a lot of work sometimes.","Bilbao opened in 1997. It was only ten years later that I was asked to do another museum. A lot of other people got work because of Bilbao."],"Frank Gifford":["Gray skies are just clouds passing over.","Pro football is like nuclear warfare. There are no winners, only survivors.","Oh how sweet it is to hear one's own convictions from another's lips.","I was the law and order.","I had three stages of knowing Wellington Mara. He was my boss for a long time and he was a father figure. And finally, as we got older, he was my friend.","Before the first year, nobody gave it a chance. Now, 36 years later, everybody knows Monday Night Football.","It is wonderful... Steve and Dan took professional football to a whole different level with the way they played the game. The fact that Steve is going in with Dan is very special."],"Frank Gorshin":["I am a man of few words, but many riddles.","The finer the bait, the shorter the wait!","With money, who needs friends?"],"Frank Grillo":["I did 'The Grey,' and it was very intense and emotional because we're in the wilderness, and it was always 30 degrees. You kind of lose your sense of reality in the fact that you're filming a movie.","My favorite movie is 'The Outlaw Josey Wales' with Clint Eastwood, a guy who gets his family killed by the bad guys then goes on a journey of revenge, eventually discovering himself - very existential.","You've got to go out there and do your things. Whatever comes your way, you jump on it, and like anything, that's how you get your experience.","I was a wrestler. I played football, lacrosse. After high school, I got into jujitsu. I boxed my whole adult life.","I'm a believer in getting punched in the face. I know it sounds cliched, but to me, fighting is a metaphor for life.","I'm not really enamored by movie stars.","What I look for in a role is the physical. But what's the journey emotionally? Can I take this person who is this archetypal tough guy and find the beauty?","I grew up with no money. No money. I always struggled and had the sense that there was this other class of people who went to college - this was when I was younger.","Listen, 'The Purge' actually exists in some form or another in many places around the world when you think about it.","You get spoiled on 'Captain America,' where your trailer's two blocks long and it's got three bedrooms.","When you have Liam Neeson in a film, no matter how good everyone else is, it's a Liam Neeson film. And if there's wolves, and you're running, it's about Liam Neeson running from wolves.","The soap opera was so long ago - the thing about soap operas, and there's something to be said for doing it, but you do a script a day. I don't want to say it's a training ground; it really isn't, but what it does teach you is discipline.","A film that I love is 'Deliverance' from back in the day. You start out with these archetypal characters - the hero, the bookworm, the pacifist - and by the end, it's all turned upside down. I love that.","What people don't know is that I'm a blackbelt in jujitsu, which I've been for 20 years, and I've been boxing since I've been 15 years old - those are things that come natural to me."],"Frank Hague":["As long as I am mayor of this city the great industries are secure.","You hear about constitutional rights, free speech and the free press. Every time I hear these words I say to myself, 'That man is a Red, that man is a Communist!' You never hear a real American talk like that."],"Frank Harris":["Strong people are made by opposition like kites that go up against the wind.","The Christian churches were offered two things: the spirit of Jesus and the idiotic morality of Paul, and they rejected the higher inspiration... Following Paul, we have turned the goodness of love into a fiend and degraded the crowning impulse of our being into a capital sin.","Memoirs are a well-known form of fiction.","Sex is the gateway to life.","There is a destiny that shapes our ends rough, hew them as we will.","All the faults of the age come from Christianity and journalism. Christianity, of course, but why journalism?","I am, really, a great writer; my only difficulty is in finding great readers."],"Frank Herbert":["The beginning of knowledge is the discovery of something we do not understand.","Without change, something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens. The sleeper must awaken.","The difference between sentiment and being sentimental is the following: Sentiment is when a driver swerves out of the way to avoid hitting a rabbit on the road. Being sentimental is when the same driver, when swerving away from the rabbit, hits a pedestrian.","Respect for the truth comes close to being the basis for all morality.","It is a wise man that does know the contented man is never poor, whilst the discontented man is never rich.","To suspect your own mortality is to know the beginning of terror, to learn irrefutably that you are mortal is to know the end of terror.","One of the best things to come out of the home computer revolution could be the general and widespread understanding of how severely limited logic really is.","Truth suffers from too much analysis.","Seek freedom and become captive of your desires. Seek discipline and find your liberty.","How often it is that the angry man rages denial of what his inner self is telling him.","The people I distrust most are those who want to improve our lives but have only one course of action.","There is no escape - we pay for the violence of our ancestors.","I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone, there will be nothing. Only I will remain.","The stakes in conflict do not change. Battle determines who will control the wealth or its equivalent.","The proximity of a desirable thing tempts one to overindulgence. On that path lies danger.","Think you of the fact that a deaf person cannot hear. Then, what deafness may we not all possess? What senses do we lack that we cannot see and cannot hear another world all around us?","Enemies make you stronger, allies make you weaker.","He who can destroy a thing, can control a thing.","Any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere. Climb the mountain just a little bit to test it's a mountain. From the top of the mountain, you cannot see the mountain.","If you think of yourselves as helpless and ineffectual, it is certain that you will create a despotic government to be your master. The wise despot, therefore, maintains among his subjects a popular sense that they are helpless and ineffectual.","Kindness is the beginning of cruelty.","Religion often partakes of the myth of progress that shields us from the terrors of an uncertain future.","Something cannot emerge from nothing.","To attempt seeing Truth without knowing Falsehood. It is the attempt to see the Light without knowing the Darkness. It cannot be.","Wealth is a tool of freedom, but the pursuit of wealth is the way to slavery.","When law and duty are one, united by religion, you never become fully conscious, fully aware of yourself. You are always a little less than an individual.","What do you despise? By this are you truly known."],"Frank Howard Clark":["There is one advantage to having nothing, it never needs repair.","There is nothing that can help you understand your beliefs more than trying to explain them to an inquisitor."],"Frank Iero":["The best music happens when you have a personal connection to it. That same philosophy can extend to the instrument you hold in your hands: if a guitar means something special, you're bound to do great things with it.","Anytime you put yourself in a creative box, it's going to stifle you; it's not conducive to the writing or recording process.","If you don't listen, you're never gonna learn.","I love players like Thurston Moore. I mean, you can put notes down on a sheet of paper, and if you practice and get your chops up, you can play like an Eddie Van Halen or a Steve Vai. But nobody can do what Thurston Moore does; he's his own guy. He talks through his instrument in a language that's all his own.","When you break it all down, my punk rock is my dad's blues. It's music from the underground, and it's real, and it's written for the downtrodden in uncertain times.","My first show was when I was a high school freshman, but it was at the junior class dance. My older friend and bandmate booked it.","About six years ago my family was affected by multiple sclerosis.","I also remember the second band I was in ever. We were called Hybrid. We got a show at this local street fair, and we were playing on the back of a flatbed truck. There was an ad in the paper, and it said that 'Hybird' is playing. I was so mad.","We've always wanted to do it, something you could dance to, and deep down we always thought we could bring something to the table if we could do it, but the live shows always made us pull back and be a rock band.","Publishing the lyric books, poetry or comics of other musicians I know. That's the thing I really want to break into!","People don't always realize that a record is forever. It'll always be there under your name. You've got to be certain that it's right.","These days, all we hear about is that the industry is in trouble. Everybody is so scared, but our mission statement is having no fear.","The relationship between 'My Chemical Romance' and Michael Pedicone is over. He was caught red-handed stealing from the band and confessed to police after our show last night in Auburn, Washington. We are heartbroken and sick to our stomachs over this entire situation.","I have no want or desire to solo. I'd rather create melodies and accompanying parts."],"Frank James":["I have been hunted for twenty-one years. I have literally lived in the saddle. I have never known a day of perfect peace.","It was one long, anxious, inexorable, eternal vigil.","I was tired of an outlaw's life.","We sometime didn't get enough to buy oats for our horses. Most banks had very little money in them.","When I slept it was literally in the midst of an arsenal. If I heard dogs bark more fiercely than usual, or the feet of horses in a greater volume of sound than usual, I stood to arms."],"Frank Jordan":["We daily share emotions, our personal and shared needs and hope.","Our extended family is an integral part of our daily lives and Connie and I welcome you with open arms."],"Frank Keating":["I think there are a number of bishops - and I put Cardinal Mahony in that category - who listen too much to his lawyer and not enough to his heart.","With or without a Social Security fix, Americans don't have enough assets to retire on. There has to be a much larger debate."],"Frank Knight":["The possibility of saying anything about a thing rests on the assumption that it preserves its identity, or continues to be the same thing in the respect described, that it will behave in future situations as it has in past.","All science is static in the sense that it describes the unchanging aspects of things.","In the long run all producers are forced to use the most efficient methods or give place to others who do.","There is no sense in making statements that will not continue to be true after they are made.","Goods move in response to price differences from points of low to points of higher price, the movement tending to obliterate the price difference and come to rest.","It is true practically if not altogether without exception that the changes studied by any science tend to equilibrate or neutralize the forces which bring them about, and finally to come to rest.","We have to adapt and overcome, that's all we can do."],"Frank Knox":["Patriotism was a living fire of unquestioned belief and purpose.","No matter what happens, the U.S. Navy is not going to be caught napping.","I believe with all my heart that civilization has produced nothing finer than a man or woman who thinks and practices true tolerance.","God did not intend the human family to be wafted to heaven on flowery beds of ease.","Some one has said that most of us don't think, we just occasionally rearrange our prejudices.","I suspect that even today, with all the progress we have made in liberal thought, the quality of true tolerance is as rare as the quality of mercy."],"Frank Lampard":["Everyone's got unfinished business with Barcelona. They're the greatest team in the world.","I am a man who likes to play consistently; I always play better when I'm on a run of games.","Nobody expects a footballer to have any kind of an IQ, which is a bit of an unfair stereotype.","A lot of things happened when I left there, and to be fair they treated me really bad, and now I have to play against them so I don't have any feelings for them at all.","When you see young players coming into the squad and pushing you, no matter what age you are, you have to react. You have to worry about yourself and perform as well as you can. If you end up looking around at others, wondering who's performing better, you take your eye off the ball.","I can't stress the importance of working hard enough, work on all aspects of your game. If you does that and you have the ability, you'll come through.","I have never seen a player as driven and determined as me, quietly determined; that's why I always want to do the best.","When you take a lot of stick you want to ram it down people's throats.","Goals never come easy. No one gives you goals.","If I lose the ball, I lose it trying to do the right thing. That's the way it is.","Every season will have its dips and hard moments, and the challenge then is to make sure you don't get too down in those moments and make sure you come back fighting.","Barcelona are my favourite team in Spain, let's put it that way.","Even with the quality of players that we have, they're an extremely hard side to break down and once they get on top of you, you find it difficult to stem the flow of attacks.","I admit I was somewhat concerned when we started to sign so many players - naturally you are going to worry about whether you can retain your place in the side.","I come from a football family which has really helped.","I don't know if we'd have been as dominant as we were last season. The new things, the new ideas the manager brought in everyone took them on board so well. He is special.","I fancy our chances at the European Championships.","I think as far as kids go, you just have to work hard. Work on your skills, keep focused.","I think I work harder on the pitch, I cover more ground and my passing is more accurate.","I think it was in Moscow last year and I got changed for training the day before we played Moscow, but the fact is they actually wanted to do John's, me and John were next to each other and they did mine by mistake. John had done them I think. So yeah it is true.","I'm happy here, and why change when you love the club and the club's in a really good position right now.","I'm really happy here. I think anyone who knows me well, and the fans too I hope, they know that I love the area, and the bond that I've had with the fans has been fantastic.","Of course it is going to be difficult for any player to get in the Chelsea side no matter who they are.","Of course, there will be few people who are sympathetic but you don't become a great team overnight, no matter how much money you have at your disposal.","The advantage does lie with us because we're at home and if we can't motivate ourselves for this match then we can't motivate ourselves for any match. I think the crowd will be up for it as well.","Training's completely different now. It used to be a lot of running and work without the ball. Now it's all with the ball, which any player loves.","I'm not silly. I understand that, with age and at different parts of your career, you have different challenges.","In international football, you need pace and you need your players up top to create things out of nothing and run at people.","You remember the finals you lose as much as the ones you win.","I always dedicate my goals to my mum. I lost her a couple of years ago. She was my biggest supporter and is always with me.","I'm like everyone else: I want to play every game, but it's not possible.","If players are performing for you, their age shouldn't really matter, especially because the older players can bring their experience to the table.","I'm not the kind of player to see out my time and sit with my bum on the bench too much. I want to be involved. That's my character.","I think about all my successes and failures, and sometimes the failures stick in your head as much as the wins. But you do move on.","People can talk about my age for as long as they like. There is nothing better in football than proving people wrong, and I'll try to do that for as long as I can.","Reading with my children is incredibly important to me and a wonderful way to spend time together as a family, exploring magical worlds through books and stories.","I don't want to be a passenger sitting on the bench not doing much, even in my older years.","If I ever have a son, I would call him Frankie, and it's a family name - it's my dad and my dad's dad, so you know, it sticks. I won't forget it.","To be honest, I was Mum's boy. Always was, always will be.","I've enjoyed every minute of travelling and playing for my country. What an honour that is.","I like to go to America. That's where I go for most of my holidays.","I'm a very private person, and you have a lot of people looking into your personal life, away from football. That's the one thing that I don't like, but I always remember how lucky we are that we're playing football.","When I was at school, I wanted to be a lawyer.","I was always pretty good at school, but a lot of it was memorising, maybe cheating off your mates, stuff that gets you through.","I didn't want to be the rebel who was bottom of the class, so I worked hard. They wanted me to stay on for A-Levels, but football came calling - that was my real love.","I don't think Wayne Rooney would be affected if you booed him, that's just how he is, but others go under. They really suffer with it. I think I'm somewhere in the middle... now. I've become tougher as I've got older.","I loved reading Roald Dahl when I was young but I had forgotten a lot about the books. I read the 'BFG' on the iPad the other day and it was so interesting to see his descriptions of clothes and places.","Footballers do get a hard time, and there is a lot of generalization going on. When you get to meet players and know them as lads, it's always a bit different.","Reading and writing is so important, and it's something I am really keen to promote. It's something that can be a bit lost these days with so much else going on.","I have made lots of mistakes on and off the pitch, and you can only learn from them. If I can get that across, then hopefully I am doing something right.","I am certainly not the most talented player in the world; there's many a more talented player than me.","There's that talent thing where I can score goals, and there's also that want and ambition to keep doing it and doing it and doing it. I've seen a lot of players do it for a year and then they rest on their laurels, but I've been very driven throughout my career. Without being the most talented, I think I've tried to make the most of it.","My dad shaped the footballing side of me, and Mum shaped me as a person. I've always been very close to her - we've only ever had one argument, and that was over something stupid when I was 13.","Scoring goals is the best feeling you can have. I always look up at the stand for my family straight afterwards; it means everything to me that they travel to every game.","For present buying, I go to Harrods because there are great personal shoppers, who point me in the right direction.","I have a lot of good football talk with cabbies, but when you want to get somewhere in a hurry, it can be distracting. I always know they're going to want to talk football if 'Talksport' is on the radio.","Being faster would probably make me better at football."],"Frank Lane":["If you want to see the sunshine, you have to weather the storm.","My fingers are not as fast as my brain - which isn't that much to type home about anyway."],"Frank Langella":["The last few years have been pretty hectic.","I'm hardly disinterested totally in my appearance.","My body of work means nothing to me.","Revelations come when you're in the thick of it, pitting yourself up against something larger than yourself.","I just feel that no matter what comes in a career - and mine has been all over the map - you must stay at the table, pick up the cards you're dealt and play them.","And the test for any actor is whether you stay at the table or go away.","Each of us needs something - food, liquor, pot, whatever - to help us survive. Dracula needs blood.","Vampires are sexy to a woman perhaps because the fantasy is similar to that of the man on the white horse sweeping her off to paradise.","It's interesting to fantasize having a man sink his teeth into your neck for sustenance, knowing that it isn't going to be terribly painful but rather very exciting.","I'd always felt a man should marry later in life.","The best kind of kinky sex is to have kinky sex with your wife or husband, the person you love.","But I firmly believe that you can't be emotionally free until you are emotionally committed.","There are no taboos in bed, and there shouldn't be any taboos in bed.","I'm a firm believer in absolute honesty.","Intelligence is enormously sexy.","Physical qualities don't really matter much.","I grew up in a household where everybody lived at the top of his lungs.","I always signed autographs when I could and always stayed and chatted with them when I could.","However, I don't by any means suggest that I'm always playing myself.","As a matter of fact, I rarely ever play myself.","Then, for a hot three or four weeks I wanted to be a concert pianist.","But when I was seven or eight, I did my first little piece of acting.","What helped me most were my failures and slumps - when I couldn't get work, people weren't interested in me or had written me off.","The only thing you have then to believe in is your craft.","But in order to be the thing you want to be, you have to work like a dog at the thing you love.","If you're lucky as you get older, you respect the craft and it becomes a skill.","You start acting in spite of your neuroses, not because of them.","One of the safest places to be in the world is the stage.","There is no right in acting.","I watch actors destroy themselves by trying to get it right.","It's a living, breathing thing, acting.","I now want to be playing parts more interesting to me and more exciting to me.","I have a list a mile long of faults that sometimes bring me to my knees in self-hatred.","There's a great deal of attention paid and books written about this change of life in a woman, and really very little written about a man's change of life.","Absolutely. I can produce. I can write. I can direct.","But I think one of the reasons I tend to stay in the water most of the time is I distrust the comfort.","I have always felt the basis of everything in life is sexual, and I will maintain that to my dying day.","We do most of what we do out of our sexual energy and our sexual needs.","I'm hardly a saint."],"Frank Lautenberg":["Municipal networks expand economic opportunities. We've got to open new doors, not slam them shut.","One thing I have learned in my time in politics is that if one of the parties is shameless, the other party cannot afford to be spineless.","I say I don't need a tax cut. It will not do me any more good. I can't buy more, I can't eat more, I can't do more, and I want it distributed among the ordinary people who work every day.","Anybody who has ever been in business, anybody who has ever paid bills, anybody who has ever lived in a serious adult life knows that indebtedness is a killer.","The President should spend his time going after the terrorists rather than sharing sensitive counter terrorism information with countries that sponsor terrorism.","I had hoped to hear the President tonight tell the Congress and the American people exactly how he plans to tackle some of the important issues facing this country, unfortunately I did not.","I ask the vice president to stop dodging the issue with legalese, and acknowledge his continued ties with Halliburton to the American people.","People at .08 are too impaired to drive.

It will never fail you.","The mother art is architecture. Without an architecture of our own we have no soul of our own civilization.","The longer I live, the more beautiful life becomes.","Every great architect is - necessarily - a great poet. He must be a great original interpreter of his time, his day, his age.","Space is the breath of art.","There is nothing more uncommon than common sense.","The present is the ever moving shadow that divides yesterday from tomorrow. In that lies hope.","Organic architecture seeks superior sense of use and a finer sense of comfort, expressed in organic simplicity.","Eventually, I think Chicago will be the most beautiful great city left in the world.","Buildings, too, are children of Earth and Sun.","Form follows function - that has been misunderstood. Form and function should be one, joined in a spiritual union.","Less is only more where more is no good.","Organic buildings are the strength and lightness of the spiders' spinning, buildings qualified by light, bred by native character to environment, married to the ground.","The physician can bury his mistakes, but the architect can only advise his client to plant vines - so they should go as far as possible from home to build their first buildings.","A doctor can bury his mistakes but an architect can only advise his clients to plant vines.","No house should ever be on a hill or on anything. It should be of the hill. Belonging to it. Hill and house should live together each the happier for the other.","Tip the world over on its side and everything loose will land in Los Angeles.","The space within becomes the reality of the building.","Get the habit of analysis - analysis will in time enable synthesis to become your habit of mind.","The architect should strive continually to simplify; the ensemble of the rooms should then be carefully considered that comfort and utility may go hand in hand with beauty.","Simplicity and repose are the qualities that measure the true value of any work of art.","The truth is more important than the facts.","Early in life I had to choose between honest arrogance and hypocritical humility. I chose the former and have seen no reason to change.","The thing always happens that you really believe in; and the belief in a thing makes it happen.","Regard it as just as desirable to build a chicken house as to build a cathedral.","An architect's most useful tools are an eraser at the drafting board, and a wrecking bar at the site.","Television is chewing gum for the eyes.","Give me the luxuries of life and I will willingly do without the necessities.","Bureaucrats: they are dead at 30 and buried at 60. They are like custard pies; you can't nail them to a wall.","I believe in God, only I spell it Nature.","Nature is my manifestation of God. I go to nature every day for inspiration in the day's work. I follow in building the principles which nature has used in its domain.","All fine architectural values are human values, else not valuable.","A great architect is not made by way of a brain nearly so much as he is made by way of a cultivated, enriched heart.","No stream rises higher than its source. What ever man might build could never express or reflect more than he was. He could record neither more nor less than he had learned of life when the buildings were built.","Why, I just shake the buildings out of my sleeves.","New York City is a great monument to the power of money and greed... a race for rent.","Life always rides in strength to victory, not through internationalism... but only through the direct responsibility of the individual.","Noble life demands a noble architecture for noble uses of noble men. Lack of culture means what it has always meant: ignoble civilization and therefore imminent downfall.","An idea is salvation by imagination.","Art for art's sake is a philosophy of the well-fed.","Respect the masterpiece. It is true reverence to man.

Eventually, I think Chicago will be the most beautiful great city left in the world.","A free America... means just this: individual freedom for all, rich or poor, or else this system of government we call democracy is only an expedient to enslave man to the machine and make him like it.","The heart is the chief feature of a functioning mind.","Mechanization best serves mediocrity.","Toleration and liberty are the foundations of a great republic.","I believe totally in a Capitalist System, I only wish that someone would try it.","A man is a fool if he drinks before he reaches the age of 50, and a fool if he doesn't afterward.","TV is chewing gum for the eyes.","Well, now that he's finished one building, he'll go write four books about it.","Youth is a quality, not a matter of circumstances.","To look at the cross-section of any plan of a big city is to look at something like the section of a fibrous tumor."],"Frank Lowy":["What is it to enjoy life? Sit at the beach? No. What it is is that you have to do something, you have be productive, make a contribution to the society, to the family, to yourself.","I don't remember all my successes, but I do remember failures.","The human being is very resourceful. When you fight for survival, you don't think much; you just do. If you think too much, you sink.","Life has its ups and downs, but you can only look forward.","Money is misunderstood. The fact is if you want to be successful - the money will follow you. If you are a doctor, something else will follow you. If you are successful, there is an accompaniment. If your goal is just to make money, you won't succeed. Money is a commodity to use, not to be dictated by.","I don't think of myself as a hard man, but other people may think otherwise. You know you have obligations to do the best you can for people, for your job, for your shareholders... it all has to be balanced between the hardness and the softness.","So many times I wanted to go to Auschwitz, but I couldn't take up the courage to go there.","From morning when I wake up until I go to sleep, I am working.

But there's nothing wrong with emotion. When we are in love, we are not rational; we are emotional. When we are on vacation, we are not rational; we are emotional.","It is acceptable to bring someone to tears if it explains to them in an emotional way why a product, a service, or a candidate is the right person, is the right thing to do.","Ideology and communication more often than not run into each other rather than complement each other. Principle and communication work together. Ideology and communication often work apart.","If you're a good numbers person, you're a bad language person.","A compelling story, even if factually inaccurate, can be more emotionally compelling than a dry recitation of the truth.","The fundamental problem for Republicans when it comes to the environment is that whatever you say is viewed through the prism of suspicion.","Preserving parks and open spaces is a winner because it doesn't need to be explained to everyday Americans.","Sound science must be our guide in choosing which problems to tackle and how to approach them.","Politics is gut; commercials are gut.","In fact, in more cases than not, when we are rational, we're actually unhappy.

We decide based on their passion.","The way you communicate an idea is different than the way you communicate a product.","The principles behind explaining and educating the product or the elected official is similar, even though the actual execution of it is very, very different.","We as Americans assume that big companies are bad, and big power companies are even worse.","I have seen how effective language attached to policies that are mainstream and delivered by people who are passionate and effective can change the course of history.","One of the things that you have trouble with politicians, particularly in Washington, is when you get mad at them and you can't touch them; you can't punch them; you can't yell at them.","The Republican National Committee hired me, and they hired me because they wanted someone who could look members straight in the eye and tell them the truth.","There's a problem with political polling in that you have so much pressure to do what your client wants you to do and say what your client wants you to say. I've never felt that pressure.

I'm not going to ever try to sell a lemon. I don't do that.","So often corporate America, business America, are the worst communicators, because all they understand are facts, and they cannot tell a story. They know how to explain their quarterly results, but they don't know how to explain what they mean.","I don't understand why people whose entire lives or their corporate success depends on communication, and yet they are led on occasion by CEOs who cannot talk their way out of a paper bag and don't care to.","When I started in this business, everybody said the Democrats were the better communicators because they sounded like social workers, and Republicans were awful because they sounded like morticians. In some cases. they actually dressed like morticians.","There are people still in the Republican Party that I believe practice the communication of anger, of disappointment, of regret, of pain, of sorrow, of suffering. That's not what the American people want to hear.","The advantage of working for a corporation is that it has only one message, because a product or a service doesn't speak; it's just there, and you can advertise it.","The challenge in working in politics, particularly if you're working for a political party, is that everyone's a messenger.","How I say it has as much of an impact on what people think of me as what I say.","We as Americans and as humans have very selective hearing and very selective memory. We only hear what we want to hear and disregard the rest.","Republicans use think tanks to come up with a lot of their messages. The think tanks are the single worst, most undisciplined example of communication I've ever seen.","What matters most in politics is personality. It's not issues; it's not image.

It was a slow process for me to just crawl out of it, like a snake leaving his skin behind.","It's like a series of waves hitting you. First, getting excerpted in the 'New Yorker' last summer, then getting published, then the best-seller list, the award, the movie deal, now this, a Pulitzer.","Mam was always saying we had a simple diet: tea and bread, bread and tea, a liquid and a solid, a balanced diet - what more do you need? Nobody got fat.","When I was a kid, I was a pretty good runner, and there was nothing like winning a race.","If I had millions and millions and millions of dollars, I'd leave a large portion to the 42nd Street library. That's why - that was my hangout, the reading rooms, the North and South reading rooms. I'd go there, and my God, I couldn't believe I had access to all of these books. That was my university.","I certainly couldn't have written 'Angela's Ashes' when my mother was alive, because she would have been ashamed.","People who think I have insulted Ireland or Limerick or my family have not read the book!","Everyone has a story to tell. All you have to do is write it. But it's not that easy.","There was a kind of madness in the country. Eamon De Valera, the prime minister, had this vision of an Ireland where we'd all be in some kind of native costume - which doesn't exist - and we'd be dancing at the crossroads, babbling away in Gaelic, going to Mass, everyone virginal and pure.","Scatter my ashes on the Shannon.","I just wrote the book and was amazed and astounded that it became a bestseller and won the Pulitzer Prize. It still hasn't sunk in.","I've had experiences on both sides of the ocean and various classrooms and bedrooms around New York.","I think that's why you see so many Americans in Dublin look so sad: they are looking for the door through which they can begin to understand this place. I tell them, 'Go to the races.' I think it's the best place to start understanding the Irish.","I just have to proceed as usual. No matter what happens, nothing helps with the writing of the next book.","You feel a sense of urgency, especially at my advanced age, when you're staring into the grave.","I've been writing in notebooks for 40 years or so.","First of all there is always that artistic challenge of creating something. Or the particular experience to take slum life in that period and make something out of it in the form of a book. And then I felt some kind of responsibility to my family.","My childhood here... was very limited. So it was a long, long time before I actually went out to Brooklyn.","And, of course, they've always condemned dancing. You know, you might touch a member of the opposite sex. And you might get excited and you might do something natural.","There's so much absurdity. Poverty is so absurd.","I had no accomplishments except surviving. But that isn't enough in the community where I came from, because everybody was doing it. So I wasn't prepared for America, where everybody is glowing with good teeth and good clothes and food.","I had to get rid of any idea of hell or any idea of the afterlife. That's what held me, kept me down. So now I just have nothing but contempt for the institution of the church.","I admire certain priests and nuns who go off on their own and do God's work on their own, who help in the ghettos, but as far as the institution of the church is concerned, I think it is despicable.","Actually, my mother and Alfie came for three weeks' Christmas vacation and stayed for 21 years. I guess my mother never went back because she was lonely.","I'm more interested in writing than in performing.","The main thing I am interested in is my experience as a teacher.","I can't go too much into my domestic life because there are ex-wives ready to do me in.","I think I settled on the title before I ever wrote the book.","We never really had any kind of a Christmas. This is one part where my memory fails me completely.","If somebody wants me to speak in, say, Chicago, a limousine picks me up at the door to brings me to the airport. I fly at the front of the plane, and a limousine meets me at the other end to take me to a grand hotel, and usually an envelope is left for me with a per diem, maybe $150-a-day walking around money, and then I go home.","If ever you are to be visited by the Holy Ghost, you should make certain you're sitting beside a fireman.","We were supposed to stay over in Boston, but when Scribners heard I'd won the Pulitzer, they told me to get on a plane - that Katie Couric wanted my body. And when Katie Couric wants your body, you get moving right away.","They tell me I'm on 'Politically Incorrect' with Ollie North. That should be a lot of fun.","When I came to America, I dreamed bigger dreams.","I loved reading and writing, and teaching was the most exalted profession I could imagine.","I was unloading sides of beef down on the docks when I decided enough was enough. By then, I'd done a lot of reading on my own, so I persuaded New York University to enroll me.","Early in my teaching days, the kids asked me the meaning of a poem. I replied, 'I don't know any more than you do. I have ideas. What are your ideas?' I realized then that we're all in the same boat. What does anybody know?","I think there are two cities in the world - New York and Rome.","You look at passers-by in Rome and think, 'Do they know what they have here?' You can say the same about Philadelphia. Do people know what went on here?","Kids all want to look cool, as if knowledge is a great burden, but they're always looking around. They remember.","My father and mother should have stayed in New York, where they met and married and where I was born.","There were a number of houses. When we first arrived in Limerick, it was a one-room affair with most of it taken up with a bed.","Certain citizens claimed I had disgraced the fair name of the city of Limerick, that I had attacked the church, that I had despoiled my mother's name, and that if I returned to Limerick, I would surely be found hanging from a lamppost.","I didn't know you could write about yourself. Nobody ever told me about this.","O'Casey was writing about people in the streets and his mother and dying babies and poverty. So that astounded me because I thought you could only write about English matters.","I never expected to write a book about a slum in Ireland that was going to catapult me, as they say, into some kind of - onto the best seller list.","I was a houseman, the lowest. I was just above - in the hierarchy of jobs, I was just above the Puerto Rican dishwashers - just above, so I felt superior to them.","When I look back on my childhood, I wonder how I survived at all.","That's what kept us going - a sense of absurdity, rather than humor.","I'm a late bloomer.","At 66, you're supposed to die or get hemorrhoids.","For some reason, I had a responsibility to my family and the people who lived around me. I felt that I had to convey their dignity - the way they dealt with adversity and poverty - and their good humor.","A funeral was a great form of entertainment. A wake was a great form of entertainment.","We don't look at teachers as scholars the way they do in Europe. In Spain you're called a professor if you're a high school teacher, and they pay teachers - they pay teachers in Europe.","I became a teacher all right. I wanted to become a teacher because I had a misconception about it. I didn't know that I'd be going into - when I first became a high school teacher in New York, that I'd be going into a battle zone, and no one prepared me for that.","When I got out of the army, I had the G.I. Bill. Since I had no high school education or anything like that, I came to NYU, and they took a chance on me and let me in.","I would dream of going up to the 'New York Times' and asking them if I could please be a copy boy or let me scrub the toilets or something like that. But I couldn't rise to those heights.","I can do no more than tell the truth.","We had nothing, no television, no radio, nothing to get in the way. We read by the streetlight at the top of the lane, and we acted out the stories.","I was just dreaming, and if, if I'd written the book and nobody wanted it, I would have put it in the drawer and said, 'Well, I did that.'","I didn't have to struggle at all to get an agent and a publisher. Everything fell into my lap.","I don't know anything about a stock!","The part of Limerick we lived in is Georgian, you know, those Georgian houses. You see them in pictures of Dublin.","My sister died in Brooklyn.","My mother had had six children in five and a half years, and three of them died in that time.","I worked in a number of high schools in New York, and I wound up at Stuyvesant High School, which is known nationally for producing brilliant scientists and mathematicians, but I had writing classes. I thought I was teaching. They thought I was teaching, but I was learning.","I never really fit in anywhere.","I couldn't fit in the Irish community in New York. I was never one of the boys because they would talk about baseball or basketball, and I knew nothing about it.","Even when I went to the Lion's Head in the Village, where all you journalists would hang out, I was always peripheral. I was never really part of anything except the classroom. That's where I belonged.","There's nothing in the world like getting up in front of a high-school classroom in New York City. They won't give you a break if you don't hold them. There's no escape.","Just luxuriate in a certain memory, and the details will come. It's like a magnet attracting steel filings.","People come up to me and talk about the alcoholism in their family.","We've had enough of the generals and movie stars. We want to hear about the ordinary people.","In public schools, classes are bloated - it's ridiculous.","My dream was to have a Library of Congress catalogue number, that's all.","We were below welfare. We begged from people on welfare. My father tried to repair our shoes with pieces of bicycle tires.","I had moments with my father that were exquisite - the stories he told me about Cuchulain, the mythological Irish warrior, are still magical to me.","I had never attended high school, but I was fairly well read.","I was ashamed of it, of the poverty I came from.","A lot of people say writers start losing their powers after 60 or 65. But I look at the best-seller list and see a book by that 14-year-old gymnast, Dominique Moceanu, and I think, 'Now, what's she going to tell the world? And these 25-year-old rock stars, what are they going to tell the world?'","If I have a cause, it's the cause of the teacher.","Way back in my mid-20s, I started making notes. I would just jot things down: lists of street names, songs, peculiar turns of speech, jokes, whatever.","Some, like Mother Teresa, are born with a gene to help the poor, and some are born with a gene to write. I was born with a gene to tell my story, and I just had to.","It gives me a very keen satisfaction that, after listening to my blather all those years, former students are now seeing that I wrote a book, that I did have it in me.","I knew I had to find my own way of teaching.","I thought everything would be different in America. It wasn't.","I hated school in Ireland.","You don't have to go fight bulls in Spain like Hemingway to write something great, or go off to war. It's right under your nose.","Teachers have a million stories, but nobody consults them.","I couldn't even pick up the newspaper without saying, 'This is a fine piece of writing. I wish to hell I could write like this.'","When I read about Joyce, I realised that there was no eight-till-one in his life: it was 24 hours a day for him.","The day I write my last word will be the day that I feel free.","Sure, I went through my 'J'accuse' phase. I was so angry for so long, I could hardly have a conversation without getting into an argument. And it was only when I felt I could finally distance myself from my past that I began to write about what happened - not just to me, but to lots of young people. I think my story is a cautionary tale.","I don't see myself as either Irish or American, I'm a New Yorker.","I wanted to avoid all that literary stuff. I didn't want the self pity of 'The Portrait,' all the moaning and the whingeing. I'm not knocking Joyce: we all owe him a debt. He's the one who made so much possible.","People want real-life stories.","On the last day of my teaching career, I was sitting in my apartment, having a glass of wine, thinking I'm glad I did it, that I had been somehow useful, that I had learned something.","You're beginning to hear the tale of the common man and woman rather than the traditional memoir about the generals who just finished the war or the politicians who just rendered glorious service to the country.","Something happened when the memoirs of so-called ordinary people, like myself, suddenly hit the bestseller list.","Autobiography should be more stringent. It should adhere more to the standards of journalism - assuming that journalism has the truth. The memoir gives you more scope, is more poetic, and allows you to play around with your own life."],"Frank Miller":["When you have a brush in your hand, inking a beautiful woman is a lot like running your hands over her.","My feeling is that the hero has now been defined by phrases like the odious one that we were all raised with - crimes does not pay. Of course it pays, you schmuck. That's not why we don't do it. We don't do it because it is wrong.","The noir hero is a knight in blood caked armor. He's dirty and he does his best to deny the fact that he's a hero the whole time.","I will throw all my best efforts into it, my thoughts and political observations, but ultimately I want to create a narrative that keeps you turning the pages and leaves you with a sense that this thing has a reason for being there.","Sometimes the solitary voice can be the best one.","I'm a spoilt brat. I thought I was just going to walk in and make movies. But I'd been my own boss for so long that all of a sudden to be facing a roomful of people who were niggling over every little scene... I just thought I'd go back and draw my comics and have a happy life.","3,000 of my neighbors were murdered. My country was, utterly unprovoked, savagely attacked. I wish all those responsible for the atrocity of 9/11 to burn in Hell.","What's happened with computer technology is perfectly timed for someone with my set of skills. I tell stories with pictures. What I love about CGI is that if I can think it, it can be put on the screen.","Think of me as the weathered sheriff coming back into Dodge 'cause the youngsters are shooting up the church and scaring the horses and not doing right by the women.","I'm a comic book artist. So I think to myself, what do I like to draw? I like to draw hot chicks, fast cars and cool guys in trench coats. So that's what I write about.","'Occupy' is nothing but a pack of louts, thieves, and rapists, an unruly mob, fed by Woodstock-era nostalgia and putrid false righteousness. These clowns can do nothing but harm America.","Hollywood is a town; it's not a medium. And cinema is a medium you can practice anywhere.","The Spartans were a paradoxical people. They were the biggest slave owners in Greece. But at the same time, Spartan women had an unusual level of rights. It's a paradox that they were a bunch of people who in many ways were fascist, but they were the bulwark against the fall of democracy.","Cartoonists' dirty secret is that we tend to come up with stories that involve things that are really fun to draw.","What I want to bring back to superheroes with this project is a sense of play. Things have gotten so dreary. The heroes have gotten so ugly that even their muscles have muscles.","You can't have virtue without sin. What I'm after is having my characters' virtues defined by how they operate in a very sinful environment. That's how you test people.","I realized that I was about to turn 30, and Batman was permanently 29. And I was going to be damned if I was older than Batman.","I think most things I read on the Internet and in newspapers are propaganda. Everyone from the 'New York Times' to Rupert Murdoch has a point of view and is putting forth their own propaganda. They're stuck with the facts as they are, but the way they interpret and frame them is wildly different.","It is more raw and unfettered and I'm more likely going into something you could call extreme cartooning. There's a lot of that in the course of 'Holy Terror.' There are interludes where there are pictures - cartoon pictures - of modern figures and they are all wordless. It's up to readers to put the words in.","I don't do a comic book thinking there is a movie. I just want it to be as good a comic book as it can be.","The comics I read as a kid were all about guys in tights. But here was a guy who wore a fedora. He fought crime like they did in Marvel and DC, but he did it in the real world. I had just turned 12 when I met the Spirit and it was a strange coincidence. At the same time I discovered girls I fell out of love with guys in tights.","But I'm not trying to convince anybody how to vote or how to live. Nobody's ever successfully accused me of being realistic.","I grew up on the crime stuff. Spillane, Chandler, Jim Thompson, and noir movies like Fuller, Orson Welles, Fritz Lang. When I first showed up in New York to write comics back in the late 1970s, I came with a bunch of crime stories but everybody just wanted men in tights.","I thought Daredevil was kind of cool because he couldn't do anything. I mean, he's blind. It wasn't that he could fly. His major power was an impediment. So I was intrigued. When I took over he was kind of like Spider-Man-lite, but I was able to project a lot of my Catholic imagery onto it. And I'd always wanted to do a crime comic.","It was said Daredevil grew up in Hell's Kitchen, an amazing name for a neighbourhood. But that opened a Pandora's box of all the crime stuff I wanted to do. I borrowed liberally from Will Eisner's 'The Spirit' and turned 'Daredevil' into a crime comic.","You do Batman right, and he's going to be popular. He's a great character. I was once asked by somebody if writing 'Batman' was like holding a Ming vase or something. And I said, 'No, it's like holding a big-ass diamond that you can't break. You can throw him against the ceiling, against the floor, anywhere, and you just can't break Batman.'","In the comic-book world, there tends to be an overblown sense of tradition. Bad habits die hard. There are ways I think the form could work more effectively if we lost the bad habits that were created before we were born.","'Comic book' has come to mean a specific genre, not a story form, in people's minds. So someone will call 'Die Hard' a 'comic-book movie,' when it has nothing to do with comic books. I'd rather have comics be the vehicle by which stories are told.","In a way, 'Sin City's designed to be paced somewhere between an American comic book and Japanese manga. Working in black and white, I realized that the eye is less patient, and you have to make your point, and sometimes repeat it. Slowing things down is harder in black and white, because there isn't as much for the eye to enjoy.","The larger-than-life thing is definitely what I'm after. I've always drawn dark stories. Occasionally, I'll try a perfect hero, but it's a real stretch for me. I like 'em warts and all, and obsessive and weird.","I don't own an ounce of the work I've ever done on 'Batman,' and I still work on 'Batman.' I love the character, I think it's a lot of fun, and it's kind of fun to be in that ballpark every once in a while, where you're seeing a different crowd.","Comics are so full of amazing work. And I can't look at a drawing of a woman without thinking of, for instance, Wallace Wood and his amazing way of capturing beauty.","As a cartoonist, I'm a caricaturist. First you find out what somebody really looks like, and then you find out what they 'really' look like.","Comic-book pages are vertical, and movie screens are relentlessly horizontal. But it's all the same form. We use different tools, but we get the job done. I'm completely in love with CGI. It's great for conveying a cartoonist's sense of reality.","Mighty cultures never - are almost never conquered. They crumble from within. And frankly, I think that a lot of Americans are acting like spoiled brats because everything isn't working out perfectly every time.","We're constantly told that all cultures are equal, and that every belief system is as good as the next. And it led to a kind of - and generally, that America was to be known for its flaws rather than its virtues.","When you think of what Americans accomplished, building these amazing cities and all the good it's done in the world, it's kind of disheartening to hear so much hatred of America, not just from abroad, but internally.","Where I would fault President Bush the most was that, in the wake of 9/11, he motivated our military, but he didn't call the nation into a state of war. And he didn't explain that this would take though a communal effort against common foe."],"Frank Moore Colby":["Talk ought always to run obliquely, not nose to nose with no chance of mental escape.","Men will confess to treason, murder, arson, false teeth, or a wig. How many of them will own up to a lack of humor?","Every man ought to be inquisitive through every hour of his great adventure down to the day when he shall no longer cast a shadow in the sun. For if he dies without a question in his heart, what excuse is there for his continuance?","Cast your cares on God; that anchor holds.","Clever people seem not to feel the natural pleasure of bewilderment, and are always answering questions when the chief relish of a life is to go on asking them.","Every improvement in communication makes the bore more terrible.","I know of no more disagreeable situation than to be left feeling generally angry without anybody in particular to be angry at.","Many people lose their tempers merely from seeing you keep yours.","We always carry out by committee anything in which any one of us alone would be too reasonable to persist.","We do not mind our not arriving anywhere nearly so much as our not having any company on the way.","That is the consolation of a little mind; you have the fun of changing it without impeding the progress of mankind.","I have found some of the best reasons I ever had for remaining at the bottom simply by looking at the men at the top.","Persecution was at least a sign of personal interest. Tolerance is composed of nine parts of apathy to one of brotherly love.","The New York playgoer is a child of nature, and he has an honest and wholesome regard of whatever is atrocious in art.","A 'new thinker', when studied closely, is merely a man who does not know what other people have thought.","One learns little more about a man from the feats of his literary memory than from the feats of his alimentary canal.","If a large city can, after intense intellectual efforts, choose for its mayor a man who merely will not steal from it, we consider it a triumph of the suffrage.","Politics is a place of humble hopes and strangely modest requirements, where all are good who are not criminal and all are wise who are not ridiculously otherwise."],"Frank Morgan":["A heart is not judged by how much you love, but by how much you are loved by others.","Art led the way for me to recover. He got out of prison before me and started traveling all over the world before I did. He showed me by example that it could be done, and I'll always love him for that.","It's my fault in many cases because I don't initiate the contact to talk with a lot of other musicians.","I'm eternally grateful to the penal system in California for saving my life."],"Frank Muir":["Strategy is buying a bottle of fine wine when you take a lady out for dinner. Tactics is getting her to drink it.","Wit is a weapon. Jokes are a masculine way of inflicting superiority. But humor is the pursuit of a gentle grin, usually in solitude."],"Frank Murkowski":["I firmly believe that we can have a healthy environment and a sustainable timber industry.","One of Alaska's strengths is our pioneer role in environmentally sensitive development.","Pushing production out of America to nations without our environmental standards increases global environmental risks.","Alaska has great potential for new oil and gas development."],"Frank Murphy":["I believe that nothing enjoys a higher estate in our society than the right given by the First and Fourteenth Amendments freely to practice and proclaim one's religious convictions.","There was a time when the contractual relationship between the employer and the employee was supposed to be none of the public's business. That time has passed.","We would be false to our trust if we allowed the time it takes to give effect to constitutional rights to be used as the very reason for taking away those rights.","Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion all have a double aspect - freedom of thought and freedom of action.","Religious freedom is too sacred a right to be restricted or prohibited in any degree without convincing proof that a legitimate interest of the state is in grave danger.","It can feel like an invasion of privacy, involving an employer in a personal matter.","The economy in the Valley will need to grow if students want to come back and work with their specialized degrees. We need to develop more to create more opportunities.","The number one reason I write is to come to schools and see my readers. I would do it for free."],"Frank Norris":["The People have a right to the Truth as they have a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.","Truth is a thing immortal and perpetual, and it gives to us a beauty that fades not away in time.","The function of the novelist... is to comment upon life as he sees it.","No art that is not in the end understood by the People can live or ever did live a single generation."],"Frank O'Hara":["Pain always produces logic, which is very bad for you.","I don't think I want to win anything I think I want to die unadorned.","The artificial is always innocent."],"Frank Ocean":["As long as your intentions are solid and about growth and progression and being productive and not being idle, then you're doing good in my book.","You just do what you can and you have as much fun as possible.","I think we all change each other's paths. I don't know which law idea that is in physics, but I don't think any of us can live without affecting one another.","There's just some magic in truth and honesty and openness.","Art's everything we hope life would be, a lot of times.","The Internet made fame wack and anonymity cool.","A friend of mine jokes that I have a painstaking royalty complex. Like maybe I was a duke in a past life.","The Internet is just another experiment showing us more sides of us.","I'm about being the best.","You can't think; you just gotta do things.","Boys do cry, but I don't think I shed a tear for a good chunk of my teenage years.","I'm not a centerfold.","Whenever I think about movies, I always look at that art process as having the best of a lot of worlds. Because if you watch a great film, you have a musical element to it, not just on the scoring, but in the way that the shots are edited - that has music and rhythm and time.","It's more interesting for me to figure out how to be superior in areas where I'm naive, where I'm a novice.","The way I approach this thing, when I started to get my head screwed on straight and really trying to make something of myself as an artist, when I was 19 or 20, it became more about function for me. Like, what is this song doing to you? What is the function of this type of artform? What is it doing?","I was a thug.","I wrote 'Channel Orange' in two weeks. The end product wasn't always that gritty, real-life depiction of the real struggle that happened.","I've always wanted to make a career in the arts, and I think that my only hope at doing that is to make it more about the work.","In art, at a certain level, there is no 'better than.' It's just about trying to operate for yourself on the most supreme level, artistically, that you can and hoping that people get it. Trusting that, just because of the way people are built and how interconnected we are, greatness will translate and symmetry will be recognised.","My grandfather was smart and had a whole lot of pride. He didn't speak a terrible amount, but you could tell there was a ton on his mind - like a quiet acceptance of how life had turned out.","I hope not to define myself by suffering.","We all know we have a finite period of time. I just feel if I'm going to be alive, I want to be challenged - to be as immortal as possible. The path to that isn't an easy way, but it's a rewarding way.","This has always been my life and no one else's, and that's how it's always been since the day I came in it.","The idea of recognising your strengths and using them in as versatile a way as you can is cool to me.","I'm extremely compassionate, loving, all of those warm fuzzy things, but the outer shell doesn't project that all the time.","Some people focus more on sonics. Some people focus more on story. I focus on both sonics and story, but music sometimes, just music itself, can turn into more of a maths problem. I guess everything in life is a math problem, but it can be more about an empirical route to getting the symmetry that you want, and this vibe, sonically.","I have no delusions about my likability in every scenario. I know that in order to get things done the way you want them, oftentimes your position will be unpopular.","Sometimes, I want to talk on a song and be angry, because I am angry. Then there's always a part of me that remembers that this record lives past my being angry, and so do I really want to be angry about that? Is that feeling going to have longevity?","I believe that I'm one of the best in the world at what I do, and that's all I've ever wanted to be.","It's about the stories. If I write 14 stories that I love, then the next step is to get the environment of music around it to best envelop the story, and all kinds of sonic goodness - sonic goodies.","Here's what I think about music and journalism: The most important thing is to just press play.","In the studio, we adhere to a strict colour code. Developed over decades, the colour code consists of a finite and precise colour palate... The whole world as we experience it comes to us through the mystic realm of colour.","How we experience memory sometimes, it's not linear. We're not telling the stories to ourselves. We know the story; we're just seeing it in flashes overlaid.","Of course awards matter.","It's cool to be recognised by your peers.","It's hard to articulate how I think about myself as a public figure.","It started to weigh on me that I was responsible for the moves that had made me successful, but I wasn't reaping the lion's share of the profits, and that was problematic for me.","People are just afraid of things too much. Afraid of things that don't necessarily merit fear.","As a lifestyle you always being the focal point is innately unhealthy.","Some people focus more on sonics. Some people focus more on story. I focus on both sonics and story.","I don't ever want to be caught up in a system of thinking I can do one thing 'cos that's just... that's just telling yourself a lie.","Super-envious of the fact that Daft Punk can wear robot helmets and be one of the most famous bands in the world, while also understanding that will never be my situation.","I've gotten used to being Frank Ocean.","My music definitely comes from a place of experience. Everything connects to a truth.","It's not essential for me to have a big debut week; it's not essential for me to have big radio records.","When you write a song like 'Forrest Gump,' the subject can't be androgynous. It requires an unnecessary amount of effort.","I won't touch on risky, because that's subjective. People are just afraid of things too much. Afraid of things that don't necessarily merit fear.","In art, at a certain level, there is no 'better than.' It's just about trying to operate for yourself on the most supreme level, artistically, that you can and hoping that people get it.","I like the anonymity that directors can have about their films.","The first four and a half years was me in the studio every day, writing songs for other people. I had jobs, too - eleven jobs. I worked at Kinko's, Fatburger, Subway - I was a sandwich artist - and I was a claims processor at Allstate Insurance.","I don't have any secrets I need kept any more.","I've written some great things. That's a gift, but there's consequences. Yeah, you get this great work, but you suffer. You really, really suffer.","I feel like I was writing as I was learning to talk. Writing was always a go-to form of communication. And I knew I could sing from being in tune with the radio.","We were poor. But my mom never accepted that. She worked hard to become a residential contractor - got her master's with honors at the University of New Orleans. I used to go to every class with her. Her father was my paternal figure.","I booked my first studio at like 12 or 13. Somewhere in that season of my life, singing along with the radio became me wanting to be on radio, you know. And writing Langston Hughes replica poems became me wanting to write like Stevie Wonder.","As a writer, as a creator, I'm giving you my experiences. But just take what I give you. You ain't got to pry beyond that.","I might just write a novel next. I don't know!","I enjoy singing my songs in front of people. I enjoy being involved in making the artwork for albums and stupid stuff like that.","I don't fear anybody... at all.","I enjoy singing my songs in front of people.","I enjoy being involved in making the artwork for albums and stupid stuff like that.","I make pop culture.","I booked my first studio at like 12 or 13. Somewhere in that season of my life, singing along with the radio became me wanting to be on radio, you know.","I don't intend to stop making music.","I play piano every day. I enjoy that.","All in all, I just don't trust journalists - and I don't think it's a good practice for me to trust journalists.","I never think about myself as an artist working in this time. I think about it in macro.","I'm in this business to be creative - I'll even diminish it and say to be a content provider.","I worked my face off.","When I was growing up, there was nobody in my family - not even my mother - who I could look to and be like, 'I know you've never said anything homophobic.' So, you know, you worry about people in the business who you've heard talk that way. Some of my heroes coming up talk recklessly like that.","Sometimes I'm fascinated with how famous my work could be while I'm not so famous.","I want to thank The Beatles for almost single-handedly getting me out of writer's block.","I guess I'm just inspired to tell stories.","You gotta make sure the listener is listening to you, so if you put it into a song, often times, if the song is striking enough, then you can really deliver the story most effectively while keeping the ear of the listener the whole time.","When I did have some success, it further emboldens you to be like, 'No, I'm just going to write what I feel I should write.'","The work is the work. The work is not me.","Because I'm not in a record deal, I don't have to operate in an album format.","I can't usually stomach a project after I finish it, but for those days and weeks and months that it's new to me, I do listen to it, and it might change over time, but it's about function.","Obviously, the cinematography of films is art, just as a still shot can be art. If I'm watching a Wes Anderson movie, the colour palettes alone, and the way they're painted, could be art. With music, you're a little bit limited, of course, because it's only audio.","I can operate in half-a-song format.","I grew up in New Orleans. I had just moved into my dorm at the University of New Orleans, and I was doing laundry, and my mom called me, like, 'We've got to evacuate. There's a hurricane's coming.'","I'm big on what's in good taste.","I respect Drake not only as a creative person but as a business mind as well. I think Drake's important.","I had writer's block for almost a year.","I need to know how many records I've sold, how many album equivalents from streaming, which territories are playing my music more than others, because it helps me in conversations about where we're gonna be playing shows or where I might open a retail location, like a pop-up store or something."],"Frank Oz":["A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.","The biggest problems with movies are expectations.","The more work I do, the more important it is to work with people I like - who are very talented.","I don't buy diamonds, I don't buy cars, but I enjoy travelling. I'm not a very possessive person as far as things go.","I'd like to read a book sometime. I've never read a book before. That'd be an adventure. I understand they have pages and everything. Yeah, I've got to do that sometime.","I wouldn't like to be that famous, I value my privacy. Mind you, Miss Piggy enjoys every moment of it. If it were not for me, she would spend all her time in the limelight.","Hope and Crosby made seven 'Road' movies, starting in 1940 with 'Road to Singapore.' The movies were always about Crosby and Hope fleeing America and finding Dorothy Lamour in some exotic location. Bob's character was cocky and cowardly; Bing's character was smooth and unruffled. They were great characters - lousy, lovable guys.","I have no idea what a British sensibility or a British sense of humor is. I have no concept of what that is. I have no concept of what American sensibility is. I was born in Great Britain, but I was only there for six months, and we moved to Belgium, where I grew up.","Always two there are, a master and an apprentice.","In order to be a star performer you have to have someone to play against.","I look back on my work and I think, 'Oh, why didn't I do that differently?'","Well, Hollywood isn't made up of individual studio heads anymore. It's made of corporations. And corporations are looking for the bottom line. They don't want to take chances. They want the money back for stockholders.","'The Stepford Wives' was too big, and it was unsatisfying to do. Not that it was unsatisfying to do, but it was unsatisfying as a result because, as much as I loved parts of it, and I'm really proud of so much of it, the entire movie wasn't what I wanted it to be. It's my own fault; I didn't follow my instincts.","I've always wanted to do non-comedies. I've always done dramas, comedies, music, and I always like to bop around and do different things.","I've rewritten a lot of the scripts I've done. 'Little Shop Of Horrors' was a complete rewrite, but I didn't touch the dialogue. Essentially, I'm a very good editor.","I was born in Hereford, England, in 1944. We moved when they had an opportunity to get a visa, about 1950. My dad always thought Europe was a bit too small for him. He wanted to see the United States... The typical immigrant story. He wanted a better life for his children, too. He always tried to get the visa, and it didn't come up.","I never wanted to be a puppeteer. I stopped puppeteering when I was about 18. I puppeteered when I was eleven years old to 18 to make extra money to go to Europe, which I made half of and my parents gave me half.","I bought a tape recorder and some stuff and went to Europe for three months when I was 18. The puppeteering was only there as a hobby. I wanted to be a journalist. When I was 19, and after I had spent about a year in college, Jim Henson asked me to come out and try puppeteering for awhile.","The power of the 'Muppets,' and the popularity of these characters, is so iconic in people's lives that I had to distance myself from publicly. Not privately... Privately, hell, I'm with them for life, and I love these people. They're my second family.","Oakland Technical High School. Like any high-school experience, it was ambiguous. I was shy with girls; I had friends, but there were times I didn't feel I had the right friends. My grades were only so-so.","I'm not politically committed at all in the popular sense; that is, to any party. I'm committed to whatever's best for the normal working person. I'm not a great fan of politics.","There's a few movies I wanted to do, and I didn't get to do them partly because they wanted me to be part of the horse and pony show, getting the money, and I'm just not doing that. There's a few movies that people wanted me to do, but they were too safe.","I love 'Time Bandits;' it's great.","I'm not an art director; I'm just not. I've always been somebody who has a sensibility that I hope is the same sensibility of others.","What I remember most about the 'Road' movies is my enjoyment at watching the two characters sparring with each other. But more important than that was my feeling that Hope and Crosby were enjoying the sparring, too."],"Frank Pallone":["It's important for us as Democrats to stick together.","My whole purpose really is to try to help working families to find better jobs and get better benefits and look out for the little guy."],"Frank Perdue":["I never liked filming the ads, but they were so well received.","It takes a tough man to make a tender chicken.","If you do this, you're going to have some heartaches from it. You're going to have people yelling at you or maybe screaming at you or criticizing you, but I think it's the best way to sell a superior chicken.","Baseball was a dream I gathered more splinters than hits."],"Frank Peretti":["We have a God who loves us. We are in the palm of his hand. He doesn't leave us, and He doesn't forsake us.","I'd like to write a series that, in an adventurous and fun way, teaches kids a way to discern between good and evil, to establish a foundation on moral absolutes.","I don't watch television.","I'm just a slow writer. I'm picky and careful and fastidious.","I don't know what idea is going to hit me when.","I wanted to write a novel where the meaning is in the story and characters and the subliminal, in the shades and nuances. It's exciting to develop that as a writer.","'Illusion' is a story of God's love and our hunger to find him when we're separated from him. If I can paint a picture of two people still in love after 40 years, that's a pretty good message.","There are writers, and there are readers who want something more. They want to get at the grist of life.","I'm trying to move a little more toward literary fiction while still retaining a popular feel.","When you are writing for the Christian culture, there is a whole gamut of expectations.","When I first started out writing the 'Darkness' books, there was, at least in my mind, a certain sort of rulebook we had to follow.","A good book or movie or screenplay should be emotionally satisfying. When they're done, you want people to breathe a deep sigh and say, 'Wow.'","The people that usually have the most trouble with my books are the ones that pick them apart from a theological point of view.","I always want to be on the cutting edge.","My earlier books, 'The Oath,' 'This Present Darkness' were pretty straight adventure. 'The Visitation' is like a deeper book, more thought-provoking. It probes at character more.","My main goal is still for the books to minister in some way, to teach a spiritual truth, to enlighten people.","Kids are not going to sit and read a slow-paced book. Neither are adults.","At the bottom of a Peretti novel is the biblical view of things, the Christian message. Whether you're a Christian or not, you're still going to have to deal with good versus evil.","Some folks run from the doubt and go backward. You try for all the spiritual Band-Aids you can find... when actually, what you need to do is press forward, to accept those doubts and work through them.","The Gospel can stand up to scrutiny.","When people get their mind made up about something, then it's: 'Don't bother me with facts.' They've got their minds made up and dismiss you out of hand. Some people don't even give you a fair hearing.","Evolution is the key to avoiding the whole issue of God. When you challenge evolution, you're basically challenging someone on a spiritual level.","There's a reason evolution is a hot-button issue. It's not just a matter of science, either. It's a matter of the big questions in life - why are we here, what is truth, where is our moral basis?","If you're going to read a Peretti book, you're going to get a message. But the book is a pretty good read.","I'm given a lot of credit with opening the doors for Christian fiction. It was kind of a difficult field when I got into it... But I don't feel like a king.","There's nothing sacred about the book you've written. The Bible says there's safety in a multitude of counselors. The movie is the movie, and the book is the book. They're different critters, and each must stand on their own merits.","The Lord God carries us throughout our lives just as a father carries his child. The Lord carried me, and He still is. He made you. He knows what you're good at. He knows what you can do and what you can become. Trust Him. Love Him. He'll always love you back.","I became very timid, very retreating. I wouldn't talk to anybody. I didn't look you in the eye. I just had that kind of personality as a kid that basically puts a target on you.","First of all, I was a good Christian kid. My mom and dad taught me never to fight. So I never fought. The other kids picked that up right away. They said, 'Oh, he's not going to try to do anything.' They'd push me, shove me, hit me. I'd just stand there and take it.","The logical outcome of evolution is that it makes monsters. We turn into monsters because evolution takes away everything that makes us human in the sense of our moral accountability, our moral absolutes, and our idea of being distinct from the animal kingdom.","When I was a kid, I really got into monsters.","Moviemaking is just really neat, and I really like doing that. I'd like to get into it more, but in terms of my role in all of this and in terms of the gift that God has given me, I had to come to the conclusion that my strength is as a storyteller, creating the story.","When you are making a movie, there are a zillion cooks in the kitchen, and you don't always get what you want to do. The story can always go in a different direction than what you would like. You compromise, and there is dealing and bickering.","Just like all my novels, 'Illusion' is a good way to observe where Frank Peretti was in his life when he wrote it.","It's man's nature to abuse knowledge and power, be it in the realm of science, government, or Wall Street. Take God out of the picture, and you have real trouble.","I'm a very methodical writer. Before computers, I used reams of paper and stacks of index cards.","Generally, my notes and outlines comprise more words than my novels. I suppose that's one reason I'm a comparatively slow writer, something that has always bothered me given the fact that other authors can turn out a book every six months while I usually take about two years.","I hear a lot of, 'I'm a writer because of you.' It's not a bad feeling, but it sneaks up on you. You don't ask for it.","I try to write cinematically. Let me define what I mean by that. First of all, I try to write in a visual way so that the reader can watch a movie in their head. And it keeps moving. I try to structure the stories like a screenplay may be structured.","I don't like to write boring books.","I just feel the need as a writer to try something kind of deep and fulfilling.","I like doing thrillers."],"Frank Pierson":["Movies are more than a commodity. Movies are to our civilization what dreams and ideals are to individual lives: They express the mystery and help define the nature of who we are and what we are becoming.","There's no question that the '70s themselves were really wide open. There was just so much being done at that time. Every year, the major studios were commissioning things that they would never touch today or even thought of touching in the 1950s.","It used to be that we felt that when we went to a theater, a legitimate theater... that we were going to share an experience together. That when we walked away where there would be something to talk about in that movie that had some meaning and relevance in our lives. And I think that we have lost that.","Even a very brief tape-delay introduces a form of censorship into the broadcast - not direct governmental control, but it means that a network representative is in effect guessing at what a government might tolerate, which can be even worse.","A 'live' show is either alive or not. Free speech is free or it is not. Viewers are free to use their remote or TiVo. Parents are responsible or they are not."],"Frank Pittman":["No one, however powerful and successful, can function as an adult if his parents are not satisfied with him.","Fathering makes a man, whatever his standing in the eyes of the world, feel strong and good and important, just as he makes his child feel loved and valued.","Why do otherwise sane, competent, strong men, men who can wrestle bears or raid corporations, shrink away in horror at the thought of washing a dish or changing a diaper?","Men who have been raised violently have every reason to believe it is appropriate for them to control others through violence; they feel no compunction over being violent to women, children, and one another.","We know how powerful our mother was when we were little, but is our wife that powerful to us now? Must we relive our great deed of escape from Mama with every other woman in our life?","A boy is not free to find a partner of his own as long as he must be the partner to his mother.","A man doesn't have to have all the answers; children will teach him how to parent them, and in the process will teach him everything he needs to know about life.","Each generation's job is to question what parents accept on faith, to explore possibilities, and adapt the last generation's system of values for a new age.","Parents can make us distrust ourselves. To them, we seem always to be works-in-progress."],"Frank Press":["For my own personal growth I had to set out on my own.","Gutenberg and Richter were very great men.","When the first computers started to come in, we tried to digitalize the seismological equipment.","It's a difficult question of relations between people.","I had an agenda. It was a very smooth transition.","My attitude toward graduate students was different, I must say. I used graduate students as colleagues: I gave them the best problems to work on, and I encouraged them.","You travel across the country, you visit departments, you give talks, you talk about the work at your laboratory - what's going on, what the opportunities are there - you talk about your own research."],"Frank Quattrone":["When we took Netscape public, if people wanted to invest in the web, that was the only stock that they could do it by investing in. So Netscape's market value was higher than it probably otherwise would have been if there were lots of other ways to play that theme.","Don't go public before you can be public.","We have a network of contacts, where there are very few boards where we can't reach out to the CEO or key board members.","LinkedIn is the Netscape of its era.","Twitter has a several-hour advantage in getting information.","I don't follow any particular periodical anymore. I use Twitter as my customized news feed.","I was fortunate that I came out to the Valley in 1979, when I came out to go to Stanford Business School, and my very first assignment as a teaching assistant for an investments professor was to - he told me go down to this computer company in Cupertino called Apple.","I thought I was kind of a hotshot because I had had two years of work experience at Morgan Stanley, and I was about to get my Stanford M.B.A.","We don't have sales trading, brokerage, capital lending - any of those kinds of things that got some of the Wall Street firms a little bit in trouble.","Respect public investors and treat them as partners and important constituents."],"Frank R. Wolf":["I don't think people want to see someone buy a congressional race.","We're not losing the peace.","Scripture makes it clear to me that there is an obligation to speak out on behalf of those being persecuted.","My hope and prayer is that the body of Christ in America will awake with holy boldness, a boldness content neither with silence nor mere words but that backs up those words with action and results.","When you see people suffering and dying and hungry, this job gives you the ability to do something about it."],"Frank Reynolds":["Let's nail it down, let's get it right.","I think your program has to reflect what your basic feelings are. I'll plead guilty to that."],"Frank Rich":["Looking back at my high school years, I'm struck by how slowly history can move.","Americans have less and less patience for the intrusive and divisive moral scolds who thrived in the bubbles of the Clinton and Bush years.","It is kind of tedious after a while, to parse politicians doing the same thing over and over again. The facts change from week to week, but the sort of masquerade doesn't.","Feckless as it was for Bush to ask Americans to go shopping after 9/11, we all too enthusiastically followed his lead, whether we were wealthy, working-class or in between. We spent a decade feasting on easy money, don't-pay-as-you-go consumerism and a metastasizing celebrity culture.","While F.D.R. once told Americans that we have nothing to fear but fear itself, Mr. Ashcroft is delighted to play the part of Fear Itself, an assignment in which he lets his imagination run riot.","When something really comes from the soul, I think it has a truth that you cannot find in politics.","After 9/11, we realized that all these silly culture wars, and arguing about rock lyrics... who cares? You know, we, for some reason, remembered what our real problems are.","In that sense, when a Bush or a Gore, or whomever, goes on David Letterman, that's the news, too.","I grew up in Washington, D.C. But also loving the theater.","I'm always struck by the kids who turn up in New York and LA, and places in between. Chicago. Wanting to do theater, wanting to do independent film. Wanting to break into television or radio.","For a man who purports to have learned of media ethics only this month, Mr. Williams has spent an undue amount of time appearing as a media ethicist on both CNN and the cable news networks of NBC.","There have been at least three other cases in which federal agencies have succeeded in placing fake news reports on television during the Bush presidency. It was a really good tour. It seemed maybe about a week too long.","Unless and until Barack Obama addresses the full depth of Americans' anger with his full arsenal of policy smarts and political gifts, his presidency and, worse, our economy will be paralyzed.","Of course most Americans don't know how A.I.G. brought the world's financial system to near-ruin or what credit-default swaps are. They may not even know what A.I.G. stands for. But Americans do make the connection between their fears about their own jobs and their broad understanding of the A.I.G. debacle.","Someday we'll learn the whole story of why George W. Bush brushed off that intelligence briefing of Aug. 6, 2001, 'Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.' But surely a big distraction was the major speech he was readying for delivery on Aug. 9, his first prime-time address to the nation.","History is cyclical, and it would be foolhardy to assume that the culture wars will never return.","One of the most persistent cultural tics of the early 21st century is Americans' reluctance to absorb, let alone prepare for, bad news.","The cruel ambush of 9/11 supposedly 'changed everything,' slapping us back to reality. Yet we are constantly shocked, shocked by the foreseeable.","Nationalization, unmentionable only yesterday, has entered common usage not least because an even scarier word - depression - is next on America's list to avoid.","Nationalization would likely mean wiping out the big banks' managements and shareholders. It's because that reckoning has mostly been avoided so far that those bankers may be the Americans in the greatest denial of all.","My particular historical vantage point is a product of my upbringing as that odd duck, a native Washingtonian whose parents were not in government. The first presidential transition of my sentient lifetime, Kennedy's, I remember vividly.","One would like to say in the aftermath of the 2008 election that everyone lived happily ever after. But the American drama, especially when it involves race, is always more complicated than that.","In the bubble decade, making money as an end in itself boomed as a calling among students at elite universities like Harvard, siphoning off gifted undergraduates who might otherwise have been scientists, teachers, doctors, entrepreneurs, artists or inventors.","As America knows, Obama turned down the lucrative career path guaranteed to the first African-American president of The Harvard Law Review to pursue the missions of service and teaching instead. The potential rewards for our country, now that that early choice has led him into the White House, are enormous.","No one is better placed or more philosophically suited than Obama to construct the new counter narrative as we go forward in our new New Deal. But many masters of the old universe, including quite possibly his chief economic adviser, can't recognize that the world has changed or should change.","'Up in the Air' is not a political movie. It won't be mistaken for either a Michael Moore or Any Rand polemic on capitalism.","'Up in the Air' may be a glossy production sprinkled with laughter and sex, but it captures the distinctive topography of our Great Recession as vividly as a far more dour Hollywood product of 70 years ago, 'The Grapes of Wrath,' did the vastly different landscape of the Great Depression."],"Frank Richard Stockton":["May you live to see the green grass growing over your grave.","I think I won't do for your business at all, but personally I have no fight with you.

It was a short outing.","Close don't count in baseball. Close only counts in horseshoes and grenades.","I always tried to do the best. I knew I couldn't always be the best, but I tried to be.","People come out to see the players. When do you see a manager anyway? When he's out on the field arguing with the umpires, making a fool of himself and you know you can't win, and when he brings out the line-up card.","It's nice to come into a town and be referred to as the manager of the Cleveland Indians instead of as the first black manager.","If he can hit, he can hit. I don't care if he came from Class Z league.","You have to have a short memory as a closer.","If the guys on the bench were as good as the guys you have out there, they'd be out there in first place.","Pitchers did me a favor when they knocked me down. It made me more determined. I wouldn't let that pitcher get me out. They say you can't hit if you're on your back, but I didn't hit on my back. I got up.","The fan is the one who suffers. He cheers a guy to a .350 season then watches that player sign with another team. When you destroy fan loyalties, you destroy everything.","I know a lot of people on the field - players, coaches, managers - are glad that I'm gone.","At least when it's in French, I won't know what the heck they're saying.","No. 1, these guys out here on this field. They keep my energy level up. They try hard, they don't complain about things - and I'd just like to be with them when things are good, and hopefully we can win a pennant together.","Managers don't have as much leverage as they used to have. We can't really be the boss.","No, I don't think my presence will cause an increase in black attendance at Cleveland.","But I'm not going to walk Barry Bonds, like some teams do, in the first inning with nobody on.","I haven't seen a player in this game, as long as I've been in it, that can't be pitched to... Barry is an outstanding ballplayer. I respect him an awful lot. I also have confidence in my pitchers that they can pitch to Barry Bonds and get him out.","I just didn't have anything to say, so I said nothing.","The way we're going... if I called up another pitcher, he'd just hang up the phone on me."],"Frank S.

It never has been and never will be. It exacts a toll on our self, our families, our friends, and especially our children. In the end, I believe, as in my case, the price we pay is well worth holding on to our dignity.","I'm retarded - I mean I'm retired.","Today it is becoming harder to speak out, with the inception of the Patriot Act, the president has legislated free speech to be a crime.","I used to think, 'How can I write my life story? I'm still living it.'","I had gone through a near-death experience, and that gives you an insight into how fleeting life is, and what's important.","An honest cop still can't find a place to go and complain without fear of recrimination. The blue wall will always be there because the system supports it.","My acting career began on the streets of New York. When I was a cop, I played many impressive roles, from derelict to a doctor, and my life often depended on my performance."],"Frank Shorter":["Experience has taught me how important it is to just keep going, focusing on running fast and relaxed. Eventually it passes and the flow returns. It's part of racing.","A good athlete always mentally replays a competition over and over, even in victory, to see what might be done to improve the performance the next time.","You don't run 26 miles at five minutes a mile on good looks and a secret recipe.","It is just called Continuing Legal Education. You can go to lectures, you can even listen to tapes on airplanes - they want you to stay current. So you do have to stay current to maintain your license even if you are not practicing.","I was actually going to law school in 1972.","I plan to be running as long as I can and have no plans to stop.","My goal is to break three hours in a marathon.","Right now, after having had back surgery, I am finally back to running again.","Again, racing for me was about energy management.","As I've been able to once again gain the benefits of speed work, I'm enjoying my running more and more.","Because running fast is more fun than running slow.","Being in school is the best place to be if you are an athlete because you can structure your own time.","For the novice runner, I'd say to give yourself at least 2 months of consistently running several times a week at a conversational pace before deciding whether you want to stick with it. Consistency is the most important aspect of training at this point.","Hills are speedwork in disguise.","I admire runners older than I - they are now my heroes. I want to be like them as I grow older.","I also held several masters running titles.","I started in law school in '71 and graduated in '74. So I was training for the Olympics, running or averaging around 20 miles a day and going to law school full time.","I think he had a wake-up call. It's a different kind of race, and I think maybe he didn't take it quite as seriously as he might have, but you can bet he learned a lot of lessons.","I think it is that parents just don't kick their kids out the door as much as they used to. I think the demise of sandlot sports has had a lot to do with it.","I think the secret of my light, quick, foot strike is related to the fact that I have fragile feet.","In other words we have marketed our way into this health crisis.","Intervals and other types of speed work are essential to improve running speed.","It is not the time spent with the child at their activity that is going to produce the highest level athlete. It is in supporting the child in an organized activity - and Bill alluded to this - so the child can find what they truly like to do and let them go.","Really, I think that going out and playing with your friends is kind of becoming a lost art, with the kids in the neighborhood.","Running with others can help get you out when you might otherwise blow it off.","So, in a way I was hedging and saying that if the Olympic stuff doesn't work out at least I can be a lawyer.","The irony of that is, what makes it kind of ironic, is when you do become successful as a professional athlete in particular, a lot of the young children who are emulating these stars do have a different perspective.","The marathon is all about energy management. I had planned to run it like a track race with strategic surges to blow up my competitors by putting them into oxygen debt, so that is the way I prepared.","The potential elite runner must realize that hard means hard, easy means easy and they must patiently seek out what combinations work for them. They have to learn to be persistent and patient with their training and racing.","The weather is perfect. The gods are shining on us.","There's obviously some validity to it. But I think it also points out that you obviously can do it on your own because people have been doing it long before they had the stuff.","To put it another way, Michael Jordan was a gym rat.","What you did was live on very little. I think all of us that were competing - Bill is the same way - you don't need much to live.","When I am totally race fit, I don't worry about breathing or technique - they take care of themselves.","When you are caring about your children perhaps you always have to remember at what point you can become over involved because of something you need rather than something the child needs.","Yes, winning the gold medal was undoubtedly the biggest day of my career - mostly because I won the way I had prepared to run it. It was a totally satisfying experience."],"Frank Silva":["I started out years ago as a theater major and got disillusioned with it. It's a rough business.","I'm trying to treat it as a hobby. Making bread and butter as an actor is tough."],"Frank Sinatra":["Alcohol may be man's worst enemy, but the bible says love your enemy.","The best revenge is massive success.","I believe that God knows what each of us wants and needs. It's not necessary for us to make it to church on Sunday to reach Him. You can find Him anyplace. And if that sounds heretical, my source is pretty good: Matthew, Five to Seven, The Sermon on the Mount.","I'm not one of those complicated, mixed-up cats. I'm not looking for the secret to life... I just go on from day to day, taking what comes.","I would like to be remembered as a man who had a wonderful time living life, a man who had good friends, fine family - and I don't think I could ask for anything more than that, actually.","Cock your hat - angles are attitudes.","I'm gonna live till I die.","People often remark that I'm pretty lucky. Luck is only important in so far as getting the chance to sell yourself at the right moment. After that, you've got to have talent and know how to use it.","I'm for whatever gets you through the night.","You gotta love livin', baby, 'cause dyin' is a pain in the ass.","I like intelligent women. When you go out, it shouldn't be a staring contest.","You treat a lady like a dame, and a dame like a lady.","Dare to wear the foolish clown face.","May you live to be 100 and may the last voice you hear be mine.","Whatever else has been said about me personally is unimportant. When I sing, I believe. I'm honest.","I'm supposed to have a Ph.D. on the subject of women. But the truth is I've flunked more often than not. I'm very fond of women; I admire them. But, like all men, I don't understand them.","The martial music of every sideburned delinquent on the face of the earth.","Rock 'n Roll: The most brutal, ugly, desperate, vicious form of expression it has been my misfortune to hear.","I'm trying to figure out, Chairman of what Board? People come up to me and seriously say: 'Well, what are you Chairman of?' And I can't answer them.","I'm like Albert Schweitzer and Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein in that I have a respect for life - in any form. I believe in nature, in the birds, the sea, the sky, in everything I can see or that there is real evidence for. If these things are what you mean by God, then I believe in God.","Basically, I'm for anything that gets you through the night - be it prayer, tranquilizers or a bottle of Jack Daniels.","Hell hath no fury like a hustler with a literary agent.","A man doesn't know what happiness is until he's married. By then, it's too late.","Throughout my career, if I have done anything, I have paid attention to every note and every word I sing - if I respect the song. If I cannot project this to a listener, I fail.","There are things about organized religion which I resent. Christ is revered as the Prince of Peace, but more blood has been shed in His name than any other figure in history. You show me one step forward in the name of religion, and I'll show you a hundred retrogressions.","What I do with my life is of my own doing. I live it the best way I can. I've been criticized on many, many occasions, because of - acquaintances, and what have you.","I am a thing of beauty.","Nothing anybody's said or written about me ever bothers me, except when it does.","Oh, I just wish someone would try to hurt you so I could kill them for you.","Don't get even, get mad.","For my money, Tony Bennett is the best singer in the business. He excites me when I watch him. He moves me. He's the singer who gets across what the composer has in mind, and probably a little more.","In Hoboken, when I was a kid, I lived in a plenty tough neighborhood.","Our civilization, such as it is, was shaped by religion, and the men who aspire to public office anyplace in the free world must make obeisance to God or risk immediate opprobrium.","My father had a piano that was a nickelodeon - put a nickel, and the roller would play."],"Frank Stallone":["If you hear Bing Crosby trying to swing, it doesn't work. He swings like a rusty gate.","Recording an album and doing it live are like two different animals. There are some people that are great singers live, horrible in the studio.","One night I was standing on Third Avenue playing my guitar, when this big Irish policeman came strolling by, and stopped to listen to my singing and playing. When I was done, he politely handed me a ticket for disturbing the peace, while at the same time telling me how much he liked my voice. I wish I still had that ticket.","If you get married, you become vulnerable."],"Frank Stella":["A sculpture is just a painting cut out and stood up somewhere.","No art is any good unless you can feel how it's put together. By and large it's the eye, the hand and if it's any good, you feel the body. Most of the best stuff seems to be a complete gesture, the totality of the artist's body; you can really lean on it.","I don't like to say I have given my life to art. I prefer to say art has given me my life.","Up until 35 I had a slightly skewed world view. I honestly believed everybody in the world wanted to make abstract paintings, and people only became lawyers and doctors and brokers and things because they couldn't make abstract paintings.","I want to make exalted art. A successful image has pictorial lift. I am looking for whatever is up there.","But, after all, the aim of art is to create space - space that is not compromised by decoration or illustration, space within which the subjects of painting can live.","Architecture can't fully represent the chaos and turmoil that are part of the human personality, but you need to put some of that turmoil into the architecture, or it isn't real.","What you see is what you see.","One learns about painting by looking at and imitating other painters.","When I'm painting the picture, I'm really painting a picture. I may have a flat-footed technique, or something like that, but still, to me, the thrill, or the meat of the thing, is the actual painting. I don't get any thrill out of laying it out.","I was worried in the '80s that the best abstract painting had become obsessed with materiality, and painterly gestures and materiality were up against the wall.","I don't like a lot of the stuff that goes on in the art world, but it's hard to be old and like what goes on around you."],"Frank Tashlin":["I got into a fight with Walt Disney: I always pick the wrong people to fight with.","That was the big secret. Walt would do things over and over again, with no regard to money, to get things perfect.","There's always been some moron-who usually went by the name of 'producer' - who would have to justify his existence, and interfere."],"Frank Thomas":["Doing something the right way is something I take pride in.","A Home Run Derby is fun. It's just like taking batting practice, and you just want to go deep. Guys do it every day. Yes, there's a little more pressure when they pull that cage back, but if you practice properly, it shouldn't affect the second half of your season at all.","When you're going into a game, you're not expected to hit a home run every game. You're just doing everything proper with proper swings.","In the South, the food is outstanding. Down south, we eat to get full, and the people up north, they don't do that.","I think there is a lot of good in making the All-Star Team. People look at your career a little bit differently.","I got snubbed about eight times for the Mid-Summer Classic, and I know what type of career I had, and I know that I'm a true All-Star. The selection process is not very accurate.","I grew up in the Boys & Girls Club. That's where I really started playing all sports, and that's why I'm a big advocate for the work they do.","At the Home Run Derby, you're expected to hit home runs. You're up there trying to hit home runs.","I come from good stock. Both of my parents are big - my dad is a big guy; my mom is a big lady.","I'm just happy to be sitting right here in Chicago and right here at U.S. Cellular Field, holding my Hall of Fame press conference. I'm proud of that."],"Frank Tipler":["Whether the ice caps melt, or expand - whatever happens - the anthropogenic global warming theorists claim it confirms their theory. A perfect example of a pseudo-science like astrology.","What you can show using physics, forces this universe to continue to exist. As long as you're using general relativity and quantum mechanics you are forced to conclude that God exists.","Future generations will know there's nothing mystical about wetware because by 2100, Moore's law will have given us tiny quantum computers powerful enough to upload a human soul.","A person whose skin is metallic can no more have its reproduction restricted than a black-skinned person. Regarding life as a form of machinery and intelligent machines as people without our environmental limitations is essential in understanding FAP, the Final Anthropic Principle, which deals with evolution in the far future.","Human uploads have such a natural advantage over present-day people in the environment of space, it's exceedingly unlikely flesh-and-blood beings will ever engage in interstellar travel.","If any reader has lost a loved one or is afraid of death, modern physics says: 'Be comforted, you and they shall live again.'","The Omega Point Theory can be a solid foundation of support for all of the great human religions.","A scientist... must accept the results of experiment, and nothing but the results of experiment.","By the last decades of the 21st century, church worship will still take the form of reading passages of traditional texts - the Bible, the Koran, the Rig Veda - but physicist-priests will preside over the ceremonies.","Either theology is pure nonsense, a subject with no content, or else theology must ultimately become a branch of physics.","We physicists know that a beautiful postulate is more likely to be correct than an ugly one. Why not adopt this Postulate of Eternal Life, at least as a working hypothesis?","The core of all religions is a belief in a supreme personal god."],"Frank Vincent":["A man's man is respectful, he's honorable, he's loyal, he's sensitive, he's strong, he's tough, he's well-groomed, he has a sense of humor - and he takes care of himself and his lady.","There was an article about me once, and the first line was, 'It's good to be a gangster.' Well, I'm not a gangster. I'm an actor.","I enjoy going to the beach, relaxing with my wife, going out to dinner, and having a good time.","If you decide to go clubbing on a Friday night, and you're home before two A.M., you're not a man's man.","You take what God gives you and relish it.","Grooming should be done in moderation.","I knew so many gangsters, and I call on that experience with them for characters.","Fellas, it's all a numbers game. The more women you meet, the greater chance you have of finding the right one.","'The Godfather' changed the way gangsters acted.","Bad boys are classy and refined. For example, even though Donald Trump came from money and a privileged lifestyle, he's a man's man.","Sometimes people start with you. Especially in local places - 'Hey, go get your shine box.' So I go out earlier. I wear sunglasses and a cap... That's the downside of being successful.","I think that all the time I lived alone changed me.","Being down makes you think who you are.","As a character actor, you have to understand that it's not about you. You have to remember it's about someone else's life. And your character is just passing through.","'The Godfather' illustrated the family values - the reality that it was really a family thing, honor and tradition. It wasn't just a single-dimension thing.","You establish a technique on how to develop characters. Everyone does it their own way, and that's what makes it fun.","We define a metrosexual as someone who really takes care of themselves in terms of grooming and style. There is nothing wrong with that. But I think you need to have some other values. It's cool to incorporate some traditional values into metrosexuality. Then it becomes a good lifestyle.","I'm a cigar person, I don't smoke one every day, but I used to smoke them, and I had my own cigar at one time. So, I'm fairly knowledgeable about that.","As far as music is concerned, I played music for a very long time, so I have a background in that.","Steve Van Zandt is a very intelligent, smart guy. He's a historian, he knows a lot about rock n' roll, a lot about music.","I think all the roles were something that sort of hit me, and I guess I was very lucky to get those roles.","My son, Tony Vincent, is a stuntman. He doubles for Jim Caviezel on 'Person of Interest.' He works really hard.","People approach you in a different way when you're a celebrity - some are nice, some are not nice.","I've met a lot of big stars who have humility. Sly Stallone is a very humble guy. Robert DeNiro is a really humble guy. Some of the women aren't so humble for some reason. I don't know why.","When lines are great, they're easy to do. You just find the essence of it, and you do it.","Actors are real egomaniacs. They get into a movie, they think the whole movie's about them.","People are fascinated with the fast life, the easy life. For some reason, that's an American dream, and it goes all the way back to the Edward G. Robinsons and the Cagneys.","A man's man has no problems with commitment, as long as he's not with a woman who needs to be committed.","Fellas, one of the most effective ways to meet a woman is on the street.","Atkins - I was on that for two weeks. All I lost was 14 days.","It's very important what you say to kids. You have to walk a very fine line between talking about your life and talking about what you've done.","My wife and I lived in Chicago for two months, and we went to a lot of great restaurants.","New York's got a little rougher edge to it than Chicago.","Chicago - it's the Midwest, and the people are not as tough or not as edgy as they are in New York.","I never in my wildest dreams thought that I'd have merchandise selling on a web site. It's just amazing to me.","I am a musician by rights, and I played in Asbury Park in the old African Room in the Robert Trent Hotel next to the Albion. That was in the early '60s.","I wanted to be what I am. All my life. A musician and an actor.","You are you, and nobody else can do what you do. But a little talent can help.","I played the Holiday Motel on the circle in 1970. I know the Jersey Shore.","If it's Saturday night, and you're sitting on your couch watching 'Showtime at the Apollo,' then you're not a man's man.","You have got to have a good sense of humor, you have got to be tough, and you have got to know how to dress.","David Chase is a genius.","I'm not saying 'The Godfather' trilogy was bad - because it was brilliant - but that was fiction. It was based on reality.","People are funny in the way that they choose to express themselves.","I did a lot of 'NYPD Blues' and 'Law & Orders' and a couple of other ones that were shot in New York earlier in my career.","There's a moment of truth that comes when you are performing, and you are all alone.","Nothing is real until you walk out on stage.","I don't know what drives me. I need to work. I wanted to be in the entertainment field, but I didn't know what.","You see mob guys when you play in nightclubs. It's part of the protocol.","I do a lot of meet-and-greets with the people, and I do 'sign shows' where I meet people and sign autographs.","When you're acting on camera, you don't really think of your voice. You think of the whole instrument - your body, your look, and whatever you have to do. But when you're doing the voiceover, you're thinking only of your voice. You really can't compare the two different mediums.","I work on television and I work in film, and the acting is two different things.","When I was 18 years old and playing the drums, I never thought that I would have a website and that people will be buying my autographed picture and paying money for it.","I spent my youth playing music, and I worked a lot in New Jersey and New York clubs. At 18, I worked all around Hudson, Essex, and Bergen counties.","Trust is very important. In 'Goodfellas' in the 'Go home and get your shine box!' scene, we must have filmed 15 takes. If you played each take back, the timing would be exactly the same each time.","I think 'The Sopranos' probably solidifies the misconception that people have about New Jersey to begin with. Because you're from Jersey, and everybody has an accent, you are perceived a certain way. I don't know if they are jealous or in awe or look down their nose at you, but that's the way life is. If you don't like it, change the channel.","I remember playing in Union City, and we had crap games after we finished playing at night. We would go next door to the cab stand where they were playing gin rummy and betting $1,000 a hand."],"Frank Waters":["The whole westward expansion myth is seen as romantic. But it's a joke, a blot on American history.","The vast sage desert undulates with almost imperceptible tides like the oceans."],"Frank Wedekind":["Monuments are for the living, not the dead.","Virtue looks good but it only suits imposing figures.","God made man in his own image, and man returned the favour.","Any fool can have bad luck; the art consists in knowing how to exploit it.","The laws of this world are for children."],"Frank Welker":["I've been doing voices as long as I can remember. When I was little I could pick up on sounds, and then I discovered you could distort what you hear and make people laugh or disrupt a class.","I was voted by my high school senior class as most likely to recede.","One thing that seems to surprise the studios is finding out later my willingness to audition. Under the right circumstances, I actually enjoy it very much.","I have worked alone and with a cast and enjoy the process both ways. There is more back-and-forth with a full cast, and you can feed off the other actors' performance.","I have this peculiar ability to be able to anticipate mouth movements on screen and fill them with words or sound.","Normally I play dads, good guys, and little animals.","I like looking at the characters. Seeing them always brings up some voice or attitude. I am much more visual, and that works so much better than having someone tell me what the character is all about."],"Frank Whittle":["A nation's ability to fight a modern war is as good as its technological ability.","Gentlemen, I give you the Whittle engine.","Well, that's what it was bloody well designed to do, wasn't it?","I had always realized it was desirable to gear down the jet."],"Frank Wolf":["We can't just rail against crime. We must speak of the root problems - devastating family breakup, an insidious culture of violence that cheapens human life, skyrocketing prisoner recidivism rates that rob our communities of husbands and fathers - and recognize that there is a societal role in rehabilitation and restoration.","There are two kinds of people in America today: those who have experienced a foreign cyber attack and know it, and those who have experienced a foreign cyber attack and don't know it.","You can't just pillory the teachers unions and sound the free market trumpet. We must visit the failing schools. We must talk to the mother who desperately wants more for her child and offer a constructive way out. We can't simply lambaste... food stamps or decry dependency.","Religious freedom, often referred to as the first freedom, is of central import to the American experiment. As such it should feature prominently in U.S. foreign policy.","As a follower of Jesus, I am called to work for justice and reconciliation, and to be an advocate for those who cannot speak for themselves. I plan to focus my future work on human rights and religious freedom - both domestic and international - as well as matters of the culture and the American family.","Having served in the Nixon Administration, I am well aware of how the political leadership of an administration can try to politicize the civil service, including law enforcement.","If there's amnesty leading to citizenship, I'm going to vote against it again.","I have been a lifelong stutterer, and when I was young, I experienced some very difficult times.","I am compelled, because of my faith, to have compassion for the weak and vulnerable in our midst.","We need to change the focus from celebrating sales at the mall to celebrating the significance of President Washington's birth to the birth of our nation.","Some people criticize the faithful for getting involved in politics, but it's important to remember that down through the centuries, people motivated by their faith have done many important things. Martin Luther King Jr. - motivated by his faith - brought about an end to segregation in our country."],"Frank Woolley":["It is amazing how the public steadfastly refuse to attend the third day of a match when so often the last day produces the best and most exciting cricket.","I cannot let this opportunity pass without placing on record how much I have enjoyed my cricket with Kent.","I don't think I ever worked harder at any match during my career to get runs as I did then, nor did I ever have to face in one game such consistently fast bowlers as the Australian pair, Gregory and McDonald.","I was not depressed when they got me out. I have always taken my dismissals as part of the game.","In the old days we were probably educated in cricket in a far more serious way than now.","It was never a policy of the Kent team that the pitch must be occupied all day after winning the toss.","Lots of times I was out through forcing the game.","Square cuts which ordinarily would have flashed to the boundary earned only two, and I believe that those two innings would have been worth 150 apiece in a county match.","Still, I believe it is only a passing phase and cricket will one day produce an abundance of great players.","Those were the great days when plenty of amateurs could spare time for cricket.","We always had to play the game and play for the team. It is a Kent tradition."],"Frank Yerby":["From where they stood, they could see the castle.","About fifteen miles above New Orleans the river goes very slowly. It has broadened out there until it is almost a sea and the water is yellow with the mud of half a continent. Where the sun strikes it, it is golden.","There was no wind in all that sweep of sky.","When it was over, it was not really over, and that was the trouble."],"Frank Zappa":["You can't be a real country unless you have a beer and an airline. It helps if you have some kind of a football team, or some nuclear weapons, but at the very least you need a beer.","Politics is the entertainment branch of industry.","Without music to decorate it, time is just a bunch of boring production deadlines or dates by which bills must be paid.","Without deviation progress is not possible.","Some scientists claim that hydrogen, because it is so plentiful, is the basic building block of the universe. I dispute that. I say there is more stupidity than hydrogen, and that is the basic building block of the universe.","It isn't necessary to imagine the world ending in fire or ice. There are two other possibilities: one is paperwork, and the other is nostalgia.","If you want to get laid, go to college. If you want an education, go to the library.","I never set out to be weird. It was always other people who called me weird.","Music is always a commentary on society.","Communism doesn't work because people like to own stuff.","The computer can't tell you the emotional story. It can give you the exact mathematical design, but what's missing is the eyebrows.","I searched for years I found no love. I'm sure that love will never be a product of plasticity.","Most rock journalism is people who can't write, interviewing people who can't talk, for people who can't read.","The United States is a nation of laws: badly written and randomly enforced.","A composer is a guy who goes around forcing his will on unsuspecting air molecules, often with the assistance of unsuspecting musicians.","You can't always write a chord ugly enough to say what you want to say, so sometimes you have to rely on a giraffe filled with whipped cream.","One of my favorite philosophical tenets is that people will agree with you only if they already agree with you. You do not change people's minds.","There is more stupidity than hydrogen in the universe, and it has a longer shelf life.","There are more love songs than anything else. If songs could make you do something we'd all love one another.","All the good music has already been written by people with wigs and stuff.","Everybody believes in something and everybody, by virtue of the fact that they believe in something, uses that something to support their own existence.","Art is making something out of nothing and selling it.","Music, in performance, is a type of sculpture. The air in the performance is sculpted into something.","Most people wouldn't know music if it came up and bit them on the ass.","No change in musical style will survive unless it is accompanied by a change in clothing style. Rock is to dress up to."],"Franka Potente":["To give somebody your time is the biggest gift you can give.","I don't like actors who try to talk directors into making their part bigger and that's really lame.","I always performed when I was a child. My parents got very annoyed, because my brother and I had our little bedrooms upstairs, and I would plaster the house with posters with arrows pointing upstairs.","I just want to be able to sit on grass as long as I want to, without anybody telling me to leave. Everything is so restricted, here, in that you actually have to stand behind a line, you can't go up the Canyon and enjoy the view.","I never consciously said, 'I want to be an actor.' It sounds stupid, but it's kind of like being a painter or something. You don't say, 'From today on I'm going to be a painter.' It's not something conscious - you've just been painting pictures all your life.","I said, 'Wouldn't it be great if Matt Damon's character fell in love with a girl with a real butt?' They were like, 'Yeah sure, sure - here's your personal trainer.'","I think I'm a really good partner and very sensitive to the other person's feelings. I want somebody else to be comfortable, to understand about my job, and if they want to come on a set and see me work, they always can.","I think when I'm in love, I really am very good with calling, little faxes, and visiting and I really put a lot of effort into it. I'm really not the one that's not available because of work and I'm very sad when I actually leave.","I'm so uncomfortable, especially in emotional situations, having to say sentences that don't feel right. As an actor - or really, as any kind of person sensitive to it.","I've published one book before, and now I'm writing a book of essays and stories about life in Tokyo. And I have one book coming out in May in Germany, about fitness.","Everybody is great when things are great. It's the 'not great' stuff that matters.","I don't really care where I work, actually, because you know making a movie is like living in movie world. There's such a secluded world, and the director is the king ruling the country, and everybody's building this little town to speak in symbolism.","I think working with Johnny Depp was very intimidating. It was my fault though. I mean he's a total cool nice, nice guy, but I was just so, I don't know, overpowered by his presence. Like he's a very mystic person. He's older so I never really warmed up around him. I was so stiff.","When I was a kid at first I wanted to own a candy shop. I guess every kid wants to - we just want to have access - free access.","My background is a small town with no movie theater. So... I always pictured myself onstage. I went to acting school and learned all the skills. I left early because I did my first movie and discovered that I really loved the minimalistic work with the camera.","I think actors are divided into two groups: one that wants to be an actor to become famous and rich, and the other that wants to be an actor because they have to be. I'm more in the second group.","I choose my work very carefully, always for the script and the director, and I don't think that's going to change. My work is like a house. It's built on very strong poles."],"Frankie Avalon":["I learned not to blink in a close-up or move your head at all, because if you did, they wouldn't use it.","Well, we all age, but I'd been taking herbal supplements for a long time.","When I started to play trumpet I was fortunate to learn very quickly.","Rocco paid me 35 bucks a week at Murray's Inn in South Jersey. People started asking Rocco to have me sing.","No sooner than I did take it seriously, I had million-selling hits and movies with John Wayne.","Kids know me from their Grease DVD, so they instantly respond. You can hear a pin drop when I do my old songs.","I was not a trained actor.","I'll be 65 in September and I work as much as I want to, take cruises with Kay, relax with my family, do everything in moderation, because I want to enjoy my life.","I've been around two years shy of 50 years doing what I do. I am a musician.","They weren't great pictures, but they were fun, and they really represented that period of time well.","I think today's music absolutely stinks. I really do mean that.","These kids today, everything is about hitting a vocal home run.","They look for the top note to end every song. They don't know what they are singing about. There is no style.","Yes, but I don't think of the Teen Angel as of an age.","I like that because the fans want to see onstage what they know so well from the big screen.","I wish I could talk to Annette, but she doesn't even correspond at this point.","It captures a lot of the spirit of the '50s.","The kids have all seen it on DVD or videotape."],"Frankie Ballard":["I've never been a morning person, ever. I hate the morning. I have more energy at night.","It really stresses me out to think about what other people think about me.","It's amazing how the biggest things in our lives - when we're around the fireplace and talking about them when we're older - the things that matter the most to us start off amazingly small and in a humble way.","If I'm blessed enough to have financial freedom in this world, my family is the ones I owe thanks to first.","I was born in Battle Creek, Michigan, about 20 miles from Kalamazoo. I lived around there for about seven years. That community is one that I really care about.","I've got an incredible family that I never get to see. I've missed so much. They know how much my career means to me, and they allow me to go and be the workaholic that they never get to see. They support me in that.","My biggest turn-on is a fine pair of athletic legs. A girl with a fine pair of athletic legs who is not afraid to show them off. Turn-offs? A girl who doesn't like country music is a huge turn-off, and girls who don't take care of themselves.","I collect hotel keys. I hope to make something out of them someday. It would be cool to make a bar at my house and, like, the bar is all the hotel keys: lay them down and put glass over them. Or maybe even a coffee table.","I like going to the movies by myself. I love going late at night when there's barely anyone in the theater. It's very relaxing.","I'd like to wrestle an alligator and fly a fighter jet.","Money definitely doesn't stress me out. I really don't care about money... I probably should a little more.","I don't really have any hobbies.","Before you have a hit song, all you're doing is banging on the door and screaming, 'I've got something I want to play...' Now with the hit songs, they're like, 'Okay man, we're listening. Whaddya got for us?'","I'm a big 'Cosby Show' fan.","Someone might look like an overnight success, but there's a lot of hard work that goes into it, and rightfully so. That's the way it should be. There are exceptions to that rule, but in country music, people really have to pay their dues.","I see so many people living in a bubble. They want to be safe, they want their kids to be safe, and they want their friends to be safe. And I get that. That's awesome and really admirable. But life is not about who gets out the cleanest at the end, or who's the most well-preserved and healthiest.","The best times I've ever had and the greatest lessons I've ever learned were when my feet were out over the edge of the line, and I was at risk of getting a little beat up, physically and emotionally.","I believe it's possible to have hit songs and popular music that's recorded by human beings.","Life is relationships and what we're trying to do together. And please, that's what people have been singing about forever. That's what the blues is all about - the good, the bad, the fun, all of it - that lies there in between a man and a woman.","I've always expressed myself on guitar, and so I look at it as another voice that is available to say what you need to say.","Some people are songwriters, and some people are just recording artists. I'm both. I write and record.","'You'll Accomp'ny Me' is a song I've always really cherished. The guy in that song is just so courageous. He's saying this to the girl, 'I know you've got to go do your thing, but eventually, we'll be together. I feel that strong, and I know it in my soul.' And there's something really cool about that.","I definitely respect the men and women who came before me and how much those people gave to me musically.","I started off as a bar band. We played ZZ Top, Bob Seger, Waylon Jennings, the Rolling Stones - everything and anything people wanted to hear. You're not really selling yourself back then; you're selling beer.","Are you really into pop? Are you really into old country? Blues? If you're not honest about your influences, then things don't sound as real as they can be. They're not as sharp a cheddar cheese as they can be. And I'm trying to be the sharpest cheddar I can be.","I've always been a band guy. That's my wheelhouse. That's what I do.","That's what music-making is: a dialogue.","I'm the world's biggest Bob Seger fan. He's like my Elvis.","'Boys of Summer,' to me, is like the end of the summer, man. That heartbreaking feeling where you have to go back to school, your summer love is coming to an end, and the leaves are changing. That was always such an emotional time for me as a kid, because I loved summer so much.","I've never felt the least bit entitled to airplay. Each spin I get means the world to me.","I probably would have never made it through college without baseball, so I'm thankful for that. I really am proud that I got to play on that level.","I'm a Detroit Tigers fan through and through.","My dad is a big Outlaw country guy - Johnny Cash, Johnny Horton, Waylon, Willie. He loves Elvis and turned me onto Elvis. He was always playing me stuff. He and I would sing and entertain the family. We'd have a little skit on Thanksgiving or whatever.","I'm a huge Travis Tritt fan. I'm a big Southern rock guy.","It sounds boring, but I'm such a guitar junkie and a gear junkie. I'm always fiddling with my stuff. It's relaxing to me... I'm always pulling my stuff apart, getting my pedal board out and fiddling with it or changing guitar strings.","I've always been a strategy kind of guy. I like laying things out and having a plan. Maybe not always a plan, but an approach and a vibe.","All my influences go into a pot like a big ole stew, and it tastes like all the years I spent trying to play the guitar like Stevie Ray Vaughn. It tastes like Allman Brothers and Lynyrd Skynyrd. And if it comes out bluesy, then so be it.","There are a lot of country artists now that are heavily influenced by hip-hop. That's not me. I was very heavily influenced by rock & roll.","Go on stage and stomp my foot on stage and play my guitar and sing my guts out because I love to entertain people. That's what makes me happy.","I'm always moving like a kid. I'm always bouncing around and never sit still.","I want to be the guy with the fresh new sound. I can remember as a kid thinking about a DJ going, 'Ladies and gentlemen, here's the new one from Frankie Ballard. He's the guy with that hot new sound.' That's the dream."],"Frankie Cosmos":["Once you're in a position where you can choose to not be around toxic environments, just do that as much as you can.","I love going to weddings. I love movie scenes of weddings. Even, like, TV-show weddings - I cry at every wedding.","I don't really understand how to do bureaucratic things - school-system things.","I think I'd like my hair to be perfect.","I never was interested in acting, and I never became good at it.","I meet a lot of people after shows, and I have to say it's pretty intense.","I knew that 'Next Thing' was an angry album while I was making it. But I thought that it was angry the way that you get in a fight, not angry as a huge life change.","If I could have a record that represents every stage of my life, I'd be putting out one a month. Everything is always changing, and so is the way that I feel about stuff.","It's funny: 'Next Thing' was written in a time of my life when I was actually really naive and thought that I was wise.","The first music-learning thing that I took seriously was piano lessons when I was a kid. I guess that was probably the only time that I was forced to perform music, because I had piano recitals, and my school also had mandatory music classes that had some performing required.","Performing is something that has really grown on me and become an important part of my life, which I didn't used to feel. I didn't used to want to really perform live a lot. It's been an interesting adjustment.","Sometimes I'll write something that's purely autobiographical, and sometimes pure fiction, and sometimes a mix.","I think that I'm definitely going to keep writing music forever. I can't stop even if I tried.","The thing is, I feel like it would defeat the purpose of being a musician if I let any kind of fear of failure affect my songwriting or making an album or whatever.","I really liked punk music and experimental music that my brother was taking me to go see in the city, when I was probably, like, 13 years old. I was seeing a lot of teenagers making 'weird' music, and I think that was probably a big part of the reason that I actually started to play myself.","It was a really long process, dropping out of college. I was there for a semester, then I would take a semester off and go on tour, then I would go back for a semester.","I'm always the one sitting at the merch table and talking to everyone at the show - and I think it's because I have this deep fear that if I'm not approachable or I'm not there, people are going to think I'm a brat.","I definitely think that touring is a really crazy lifestyle and makes it hard to live a normal life and have relationships and friendships.","What I really care about is writing... Some people feel about touring the way I feel about writing, which is, 'Whoa, I can't believe I get to do this as a job.'","I was seeing kids my age playing shows at their parents' houses or the couple of all-ages venues that existed. I feel like I saw so many different kinds of music that I wouldn't have discovered on my own.","My brother was 13 when people started telling me that he was a 'hipster.' I was 11 and thought it was so stressful, like, 'How do you not be called that?'","My parents listened to a lot of James Taylor and Hall and Oates. My mom and I used to listen to Liz Phair and Indigo Girls a lot in the car, too.","Around seventh grade, I got a guitar and forgot everything else.","You meet a lot of people in New York who are different than you and have different stories, so I see everyone as super individual. I feel like I can be infinitely inspired because New York is huge.","I realized I was trained my whole life to be an accommodating person, to make sure that everybody is comfortable before I'm comfortable. After giving so much of myself to strangers, I learned to care for myself a little more, especially on tour.","I'm not just going to hug every person that asks to hug me.","I don't actually have problems dealing with corporate situations. There are times I've railed against it, but there are other times when I'm like, 'I'll take your money, no problem.'","I can be very social, but often, it weighs down on me later that the social thing was a put-on. I feel like my way of dealing with not wanting to go out is, I just don't. I can't bring myself to.","I kind of like the idea of creating my own literature within my albums. I definitely thought about that when I started writing songs.","If I had to pick an artist that I look up to and am inspired by, it's Matisse because of how many times he would paint the same idea until he felt like he maybe got it right, and I try to do the same thing with my writing.","I think part of the process of putting out a record is always looking back because, by the time a song comes out, it's been a year since you wrote it.","It's good for people to be able to see an archive of an artist learning how to write and getting better, especially for teenagers who are starting to write: to see that I started out making pretty easy and weird and bad-sounding music and that you can teach yourself how to write over a long period of time.","My parents have both done some music stuff. My family was very artist-friendly, so that was encouraging.","When I was 16, I really decided that music was something I wanted to do.","Those emotions that are really strong, the ones that inspire a song, you can hold onto that. You can let it marinate for years and keep writing about it even better than you did then.","It's even easier to write about the past now that I'm happy and have better stuff to write about. That's why someone like Bob Dylan can make so many records over so long a time; it's not like he's been sad all this time. He's really successful!","I go through phases sometimes: 'I'm a genius; they get me,' and sometimes I'm like, 'Why does anyone want to hear me?'","The way my body is viewed in the world is different than a male body. People are going to write about the performance, but they're probably also going to be writing about what I was wearing or my hair, which just doesn't happen to men.","I try to not assume things are sexism. I'm trying to be good natured about why things are happening.","The only reason to do this job is because I love playing my music. And I love my bandmates.","I don't even know how people managed without the Internet years ago. Having to mail a cassette tape of your music to strangers over the course of months... I just can't imagine having to do that.","When I was 18, I borrowed my parents' car, and they are super supportive. They might give us snacks for the road, but it's not like they are paying clubs to book us.","I feel like I can't write something that has a real emotion in it if I can't connect to that emotion.","There've been times on tour when people have said to us, 'Yeah, your band is really simple.' But it's really not.","Sometimes I'm really mean to someone who just hugged me. I never thought that I would be like that.","I've definitely gotten to the point where we get to the venue, and people know that I'm in charge of the band.","I think I'm always changing as a writer and trying new things.","I played my first show when I was 17, and that was a big moment. I realized it was something I could keep doing.","I feel like touring is a man's game. And I don't think that's sexist; I just think, on tour, you can't really take care of yourself the way you want to.","If I ever go back to college, I'd study art education.","One of the cool things about traveling and being a musician is that you meet so many people who have studied different things and have different careers.","I've played Frankie Cosmos shows where the promoter or whoever sees that I'm the lead singer, and then they go up to David, the bassist, and are like, 'So, do we pay you?' And he's like, 'No, you pay her; she's the boss.' Those are moments where I'm just like, 'I'm clearly in charge.'","My Bandcamp had a lot of bad and good music, but I relied on that to sort my feelings. My sadness will always be there, even in the happiness.","Whenever I'm really excited about a song, I want to learn it, and it becomes the first thing I play every time I pick up an instrument."],"Frankie Faison":["No one deserves any more respect than the other person until they prove themselves unworthy.","Don't be afraid to see the gift and talent you have, because that thing could lead to a substantial career for you. Because we all do something as good or better than most people.","I love Montclair. I loved it; it was great for my kids. I raised them all there, brought them up through the Montclair school system, and two of my daughters went to Montclair State.","Respect is such a simple and easy thing to have and to give, and it doesn't cost anything.","When you look in the mirror at the end of the day, make sure you feel good about what you see.","Your time here on this earth, it belongs to you.","Far too often, I have been accepted or rejected for work because of the color of my skin.","I've been asked far too often, 'Can you be blacker?' I've gotten done with auditions and heard, 'We're not going to go black with this character.'","I think it is so important to pass down knowledge and information to younger generations.","I don't do things by the book."],"Frankie J. Alvarez":["My grandma was actually a pretty well-known opera singer in Cuba, and then my mom was a ballerina. Two of my three sisters are dancers, so we grew up in the arts.","When you're auditioning for commercials, they're looking for a Latin guy in his 20s, and you'll show up, and it's a bunch of people who look just like you, and it's a little weird. More often than not, they're way better-looking. They're taller. They have way more abs than you do.","I can't point to my work and say, 'This is my work.' My work lives in me, so when people criticize my work, they're also criticizing me. It's really hard to sort of divorce that sensitivity.","You put a lot of yourself into a character, so even though he's not you, in a sense it is you.","One of my first jobs was doing children's theater. I did it to get my union card.","My dad was very religious growing up and a little bit closed minded, and I think me being in the theater, two of my three sisters are dancers, so being in the arts world has changed and opened him up in a lot of ways."],"Frankie Muniz":["I know I am no better than anyone else in this world.","Some kids are always getting into trouble or doing stuff, and I stay away from those types. I know I am no better than anyone else in this world. I'm just an actor, that's nothing special. But I'm not into anything bad. Just blackjack.","I wanna do movies that in ten years time people will respect me for, as an actor. So if I do take two years off or three years off, the next movie I have that comes out you want people to go 'ooh, that's Frankie Muniz's new movie, it's gonna be a good movie cause he's in it.'","I am keeping with tradition today. After I learned of my Golden Globe nomination, I went to the dentist, so today, let's make it the orthodontist.","Yeah, I like cars and basketball. But you know what I like more? Bananas.","Acting classes, I guess, are good and I would like to maybe sometime take one. But I would feel like I was learning someone else's technique. I like mine.","There was a scene cut out of 'Big Fat Liar' (2002) where I had to wear a dress. This may sound kind of weird, but I really enjoyed shooting that scene.","I'm just an actor, that's nothing special."],"Frankie Shaw":["I discovered that my biggest passion was for directing, so in making opportunity for myself, I found what I like doing the best.","I moved out to L.A. and had my son and was walking around Gelson's, and I was like, 'Am I just one giant, lactating boob? Is that what I've become?'","There was a feeling I had when I got pregnant and decided to keep the baby, and I knew I wasn't going to be with the baby daddy, and I was really toying with what my identity would be.","There's this idea that motherhood is as American as apple pie, but yet we don't support it with any government assistance.","I want to disappear in a role.","I am fully a feminist in this modern definition of the term. It's innate in my work because that's just who I am.","Most of the stories I write are women's stories - but the darker, unseen stories.","When I first had Isaac, I only owned a mattress. Now I have a show?","When my son was small, he just came with me everywhere, whether it was going to yoga class or auditions or sleeping over at friends' houses. We came as a pair.","We had no money. My family was in Southie; I was in affluent Brookline. I don't know if it's my personality or the circumstance, but it all kind of led to this feeling of being an observer on the outside.","Because I'd grown up with this singular focus on sports, I just kind of did that with acting. That became an obsession. How am I going to make it? How am I going to figure that out?","I moved to L.A. because I didn't want to be in New York anymore. And I knew if I wanted to act, it would have to be in one of those places.","I was actually really sick of being a broke actress with a toddler, so I wrote a script."],"Frankie Valli":["I spent many a summer early morning with the radio very low, half sleeping and half listening.","I cherish the memory of being a friend of Frank Sinatra on a friendship level to the point where we really hung out. We worked in Vegas, we'd talk on the phone, and if I wasn't doing anything, I'd fly out, and I spent time in Palm Springs at his house - on a level the way friends would be, not with a whole crowd of people.","You can take the guy out of the neighorhood but you can't take the neighborhood out of the guy.","Becoming successful is a relentless pursuit. It's good that it's that way: When it does come, you learn to know how to appreciate it, and know how lucky you are to be doing something that you love so much.","When we were trying to get 'Jersey Boys' off the ground, I'd get, 'The Four Seasons? Who's going to care? There's the Beatles, there's the Rolling Stones.' But people know those stories. Here was a story no one knew.","I went to school to learn to be a hairdresser. I worked at a wholesale florist, where I delivered to florists all over New Jersey. I'd come home and go out to work down at the Shore. The early jobs, I remember, were $5, $6 a night. And I lived in the projects right until the time I became successful.","Jazz was my first love.","At school, I'd sing in groups in the locker room or in the bathroom, which was like an echo chamber. The problem is I didn't know how to get started singing professionally. The pool hall was my Facebook. I'd hang out there to keep up with what was going on and to let people know where I could be reached if singing jobs came up.","It's unconditional love with your kids.","I have to believe that most people know that 'Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You' is my song. But the reaction we get from the audience at 'Jersey Boys' is that they didn't remember how many hits we had. A lot of 'Oh yeah, I forgot they did that song.' We had 20 Top 10 hits in the U.S... people forget.","'Jersey Boys' has been the most amazing experience ever and has exposed an entire new audience to the music. It's great to see people of all ages coming to the show.","My name actually is Francesco Castaluccio.","I'm not doing contemporary songs unless something comes along that really knocks my socks off.","It was very important to establish a sound, so that people heard a record on the radio and knew immediately that it was you.","I do belong to Jersey. There's no doubt about that in my mind. They have been so loyal and so good to me; how could I possibly belong any place else?","I grew up beyond proud - we didn't have much, but we had a lot of love.","I learned by listening to other people sing and doing impressions of them. And there are things no one can ever teach you, like phrasing. By listening to Sinatra, for instance - you felt that everything he sang had happened in his life.","With 'Sherry,' we were looking for a sound. We wanted to make the kind of mark that, if the radio was playing one of our songs, you knew who it was immediately. But I didn't want to sing like that my whole life.","I always believed a singer should be able to sing any kind of song. If I wanted to sing a Cole Porter song, I should be able to do that. Or 'Sherry,' I should be able to do that. Or a Dylan song.","In 1967, I found out I was losing my hearing. I went 10 years without any help. I had otosclerosis - hardening of the bone in the middle of the ear.","If I close my eyes, I can remember the first apartment where I lived with my family in Newark, N.J., in the late 1930s. The rooms were lined up like train cars - you had to go through one to get to another - and there wasn't any heat or hot water.","When I was a kid, I used to listen to my Emerson radio late at night under the covers. I started by listening to jazz in the late 1940s and then vocal harmony groups like the Four Freshmen, the Modernaires and the Hi-Lo's. I loved Stan Kenton's big band - with those dark chords and musicians who could swing cool with individual sounds.","Starting in my teens, I was always standing on the corner near our apartment singing harmony with friends. We'd also go to the park and sing under the bridge near the lake for the echo. When it was cold out, we'd stand in the little heated lobby in the project's administration building, where my mom paid the rent each month.","One day, when I was still living at home, a friend told 'Texas' Jean Valli about me. She was originally from Syracuse, N.Y., and lived in New Jersey but sang country. One night, she had me come up on stage where she was performing. I sang 'My Mother's Eyes,' and she was knocked out.","I'd seen so many people become stagnant in New Jersey - I had this fear I'd just stay there. They'd come out of high school, get a job, get married, have kids and die in Jersey. I wanted more.","People don't get married to get divorced. Maybe people weren't meant to be together forever.","I don't play golf or tennis, I don't ski, I don't snowboard. If you love what you do, you never get enough of it.","I thought everybody had falsetto. And since I wasn't a schooled singer who studied with anybody, I just thought anybody who had a voice could do anything they wanted with their voice.","Establishing a style is important, it really is, but a lot of singers get so involved with their instrument, and more so than they do in what they're singing. I think you really have to think about what you're singing. You have to make the public believe what you're singing. And in order to do that, you have to believe it.","The very first time I ever heard anything of mine on the radio, I was in New Jersey, and I was in my teens. I did my first record, which was an old standard called 'My Mother's Eyes.' It was the old Georgie Jessel theme. I heard it on local radio out of Newark. And it was very exciting!","There were a lot of R&B groups that were my heroes, but the funny thing about my career and the way it went and where it went, at first I didn't really want to do pop music. I was a little bit more into jazz and R&B.","I think Lady Gaga is talented. Madonna is talented, and the flair that Michael Jackson had. He was talented! Whatever it is that they do, they must be doing something right. They do have an audience out there, so I respect that.","The '60s was a magical time in the music business. So much creativity and talent. I think a lot of it came from the fact that we had grown up before rock n' roll. We listened to all the great songwriters and big bands, songs with great lyrics and melodies. I think that really influenced everybody.","It's always very special for me to work Chicago. Both of the record companies I was with, early on, were based in Chicago. The music was always huge there.","When somebody is making a movie about your life, that's different. A show is a live performance. Things are going to go wrong. You are going to get away with things. A movie is indelible. A movie is through a microscope.","Where I grew up, in New Jersey, there was a lot of organised crime activity. It was a part of life."],"Franklin Cover":["When you talk about a character on a situation comedy, it's not just the actor. It's the writers, too.","Everything I've done until 'The Jeffersons' - the plays, the movies, the soap operas - were all in New York.","I auditioned for Roosevelt in 'The Winds of War,' but Ralph Bellamy got the role.","I got to work with Ingrid Bergman, and it was a wonderful experience.","When a show is popular, sometimes the industry dismisses it.","When I go to New York, all the skycaps want my autograph."],"Franklin D. Roosevelt":["Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort.","When you reach the end of your rope, tie a knot in it and hang on.","In politics, nothing happens by accident. If it happens, you can bet it was planned that way.","Let us never forget that government is ourselves and not an alien power over us. The ultimate rulers of our democracy are not a President and senators and congressmen and government officials, but the voters of this country.","I'm not the smartest fellow in the world, but I can sure pick smart colleagues.","There are many ways of going forward, but only one way of standing still.","The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.","If civilization is to survive, we must cultivate the science of human relationships - the ability of all peoples, of all kinds, to live together, in the same world at peace.","We have always held to the hope, the belief, the conviction that there is a better life, a better world, beyond the horizon.","Nobody will ever deprive the American people of the right to vote except the American people themselves and the only way they could do this is by not voting.","The point in history at which we stand is full of promise and danger. The world will either move forward toward unity and widely shared prosperity - or it will move apart.","The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.","I pledge you, I pledge myself, to a new deal for the American people.","Men are not prisoners of fate, but only prisoners of their own minds.","Competition has been shown to be useful up to a certain point and no further, but cooperation, which is the thing we must strive for today, begins where competition leaves off.","I think we consider too much the good luck of the early bird and not enough the bad luck of the early worm.","Human kindness has never weakened the stamina or softened the fiber of a free people. A nation does not have to be cruel to be tough.","Democracy cannot succeed unless those who express their choice are prepared to choose wisely. The real safeguard of democracy, therefore, is education.","To reach a port, we must sail - sail, not tie at anchor - sail, not drift.","A nation that destroys its soils destroys itself. Forests are the lungs of our land, purifying the air and giving fresh strength to our people.","The only sure bulwark of continuing liberty is a government strong enough to protect the interests of the people, and a people strong enough and well enough informed to maintain its sovereign control over the goverment.","I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made.","Confidence... thrives on honesty, on honor, on the sacredness of obligations, on faithful protection and on unselfish performance. Without them it cannot live.","Yesterday, December seventh, 1941, a date which will live in infamy, the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. We will gain the inevitable triumph, so help us God.","A conservative is a man with two perfectly good legs who, however, has never learned how to walk forward.","It is common sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something.","True individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence. People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made.","The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much it is whether we provide enough for those who have little.","The nation that destroys its soil destroys itself.","One thing is sure. We have to do something. We have to do the best we know how at the moment... If it doesn't turn out right, we can modify it as we go along.","Be sincere; be brief; be seated.","Don't forget what I discovered that over ninety percent of all national deficits from 1921 to 1939 were caused by payments for past, present, and future wars.","Physical strength can never permanently withstand the impact of spiritual force.","It isn't sufficient just to want - you've got to ask yourself what you are going to do to get the things you want.","We are trying to construct a more inclusive society.

We are still in the making.","In our personal ambitions we are individualists. But in our seeking for economic and political progress as a nation, we all go up or else all go down as one people.","Not only our future economic soundness but the very soundness of our democratic institutions depends on the determination of our government to give employment to idle men.","There is a mysterious cycle in human events. To some generations much is given. Of other generations much is expected.

And therefore, I think our humanity is, in some ways, the thing that's under existential threat.","Trump has emphatically denied ties to Russia - a claim refuted by his Twitter feed and a cursory Google search. Putin says his government had nothing to do with the hack of the DNC computers, even though it carelessly left a trail of crumbs tracing back to his intelligence services. The cunning liar is exploiting the blundering one.","Monopolists always defend their monopolies by arguing that competition is wasteful. When the railroad barons completed their monopoly, they argued it would be wasteful to have competing rail lines, AT&T said the same thing. But today, the size and scope of these monopolies is different.","I grew up using maps and having a sense of direction, and now I have a phone. I used to try to remember numbers, and now I... can just call them up instantly. And that's great. But what's happening right now is that we're in a phase of human evolution where we're merging with machines.","When you're staring at your phone to navigate and being led places, you do become less aware of your environment, and the journey becomes kind of automated. There is an aliveness that comes with having to puzzle out directions for yourself. And you have to ask other people for help, which creates opportunity for social connection.","The biggest problem is that Facebook and Google are these giant feedback loops that give people what they want to hear. And when you use them in a world where your biases are being constantly confirmed, you become susceptible to fake news, propaganda, demagoguery.","We've been merging with tools since the beginning of human evolution, and arguably, that's one of the things that makes us human beings.","Google is arguably one of the greatest inventions. The search engine is one of the greatest inventions in human history.","Google helps us sort the Internet by providing a sense of hierarchy to information. Facebook uses its algorithms and its intricate understanding of our social circles to filter the news we encounter. Amazon bestrides book publishing with its overwhelming hold on that market.","Along with Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple, these companies are in a race to become our 'personal assistant.' They want to wake us in the morning, have their artificial intelligence software guide us through our days, and never quite leave our sides.","Brazil is a country largely resistant to ideology. This is a strange fact given its founding by followers of the French philosopher Auguste Comte, who inscribed an epigram from his philosophy of positivism in the national flag: Order and Progress.","If you think of data as kind of an x-ray of our soul, it's this window into our minds that the company has possessed. It's a very, very powerful x-ray for them to hold because the more that you understand about somebody, the easier it is to manipulate them.","It's very un-American to say nice things about elites. Elites are often terrible. It's not like we've ever had a perfect set of benevolent democratic elites ruling over our country. But the fact of the matter is that a representative system of democracy delegates power to elites.","Hunting for malware requires highly specialized knowledge of the intricacies of the domain name system - the protocol that allows us to type email addresses and website names to initiate communication. DNS enables our words to set in motion a chain of connections between servers, which in turn delivers the results we desire.","We think of Netflix as a great personalization machine. It understands how you love French midcentury cinema and British murder mysteries, so examples of those pop up in your personalization engine.

The battle against Islamism also remains a rallying cry; Fillon's campaign manifesto is called 'Conquering Islamic Totalitarianism'.","As parents, we have kids who reflect back to us our addiction to devices, and we have all sorts of worries about whether this is a healthy thing.","Trump considers himself such a virile example of masculinity that he's qualified to serve as the ultimate arbiter of femininity. He relishes judging women on the basis of their looks, which he seems to believe amounts to the sum of their character.","When the mayor of Sao Paulo wanted to increase bus fare by 21 centavos in 2013, the country erupted in the largest mass protests in its history. It wasn't a dramatic hike - just nine cents - but a perfect symbol of the increasing burdens on the working poor, forced to fend with an inadequate system, insensitive to their plight.","In the epic war over Silicon Valley's intellectual property, Bill Gates was on the side of licensing copyright and robust protections for intellectual property. He wasn't on the side of the hackers, and he didn't want information to be free.","When I started off in journalism, you knew there was an audience out there and that you wanted people to read what you produced. But it also felt like you had a limited ability to shape the audience, or to acquire an audience, for what you were doing. So you didn't really think too much about that.","If you game Facebook and Google in the right way, then you can achieve a mass audience.","Of course, formulas always existed in journalism. When I was just getting into the business, 'Time' and 'Newsweek' knew if they could put Jesus' face on the cover that it would do really well on the newsstands. So every year, they would put Jesus' face on the newsstand. There was a formula there.","Once upon a time, if you were going to get a loan from me, I would have had to look at your file, and I would have to make a decision about whether youre going to get a loan. Maybe we would meet and talk about it. There would be some level of human involvement and human interaction. Now, a lot of this is determined by an algorithm.","The Internet was invented in an age when our entire approach to regulation has been extremely lax, and so you'd think, 'OK, there might be a law on the books that governs how these corporations can handle our data.'","There's this proud American tradition of worrying about the power of communication companies. That going all the way back to the founding, we've tried to limit the power of monopolies that played a role in our democracy.","Google's ability to pick winners and losers in the information world is a menace. These companies have the ability to determine which media companies are successful and which ones are failures. If I adopt a business plan that doesn't line up with Google's, then they're not going to reward me.","If I'm reading my Facebook feed, it's using algorithms, procedures, and methods to give me what I want, or what it thinks that I want, or what suits its business plan.","Booksellers initially thought of Amazon as their best friend. They were coming in, and they were challenging Barnes and Noble, and Borders, which were the big, dominant corporations of the day, and that they would disrupt them and make them less powerful, but they could never envision that Amazon would overtake them all.","Apple was very important in terms of disrupting the music business and remaking the television business. They made it harder for people to make money on the things that they produce. In news, they've created Apple News, and they've tried to steer people towards information.","From the start, the promise of Jurgen Klinsmann as manager of the U.S. men's national team was revolution: gritty, plodding American soccer would give way to attacking flair; the parade of journeymen would end; an era of skilled stylists would begin.","Michael Bradley has the stuff of leadership; he works hard and can break up the opponent's play. However, that's not enough to justify his philanthropic attitude towards possession, the generous portion of balls that he contributes to his foes. His sloppiness constantly culminates in unnecessary goals.","There's no reason why there needs to be one search engine or one social network or one store that we buy all of our crap from. It's possible to imagine a world in which there's actually competition.","Who can complain about the price that Google is charging you? Or who can complain about Amazon's prices; they are simply lower than the competition's. And that's why I think we need to shift back to a more Brandeisian conception of antitrust, where we consider values other than simply efficiency and low prices.","I'm reading the way a lot of technology executives have decried 'gatekeepers' and 'traditional media,' and that one of the promises of 'new media' was that it would break the chokehold that old media companies had on public opinion.","Once upon a time, gatekeepers were newspaper publishers and magazine editors and people who ran radio stations and news networks. And they decided what went above the fold and what went on page A10.","Trump and Yanukovych have shared the same political brain: an operative named Paul Manafort.","Ukrainians use the term 'political technologist' as a favored synonym for electoral consultant. Trump turned to Manafort for what seemed at first a technical task: Manafort knows how to bullwhip and wheedle delegates at a contested convention.","The genesis of Donald Trump's relationship with Paul Manafort begins with Roy Cohn. That Roy Cohn: Joe McCarthy's heavy-lidded henchman, lawyer to the Genovese family. During the '70s, Trump and his father hired Cohn as their lawyer to defend the family against a housing discrimination suit.","As the 2016 campaign has graphically illustrated, Trump doesn't treat rivals gently. Testifying before a congressional committee in 1993, he began with his rote protestations of friendship.","There are, in fact, apps you can use to measure how many times you check your phone, and I shudder to think how many times I check my phone. I'm sure it would be probably in the hundreds of times that I check over the course of the day.","Mark Zuckerberg has never really had pressure put on him. He's an engineer, and he's created this perfect system that is Facebook, and he's always been concerned about the internal beauty and logic of this creation that he's created. I don't think that the human implications of what he's created have often been apparent to him.","I look at the way that my kids interact with technology, and it becomes a mirror to the ways in which I myself interact with technology. I can see the ways in which that addiction and compulsion starts to settle in on them, and it's much more unnerving to see it in them than it is to experience it myself.","On its face, Donald Trump's hateful musings about women and his boastful claims of sexual dominance should be reason alone to drive him from polite society and certainly to blockade him from the West Wing. Yet somehow, his misogyny has instead propelled his campaign to the brink of the Republican nomination.","Not even Trump's father's wealth, nor his father's faith in his son's destiny, could save Trump from incessant discipline. At the age of 13, he was shipped off to the New York Military Academy, which employed brutal tactics for the remaking of delinquent character, even resorting to violence to assert control over the boys.","Our faith in technology is no longer fully consistent with our belief in liberty.","The greatest miracle of the Internet is that it exists - the second greatest is that it persists.","Computer scientists have built a set of massive DNS databases, which provide fragmentary histories of communications flows, in part to create an archive of malware: a kind of catalog of the tricks bad actors have tried to pull, which often involve masquerading as legitimate actors.","I'd actually argue that the best thing to happen to the 'Washington Post' was hiring Marty Baron, maybe the greatest newspaper editor of his generation.","The first book advance I got was paid out in thirds. And over time, as I've had different deals, the advances get chopped up into ever-smaller parcels.","Self-publishing is fine. But in a world of self-publishing, where everything is about what you get on the back end, there's a serious disincentive from embarking on really important, vital projects.","I think what's happening with book advances is something that most of the world just doesn't fully appreciate, especially when it comes to nonfiction, because writing a book of investigative journalism is an expensive endeavor, and the system works best if you have publishers making bets on authors.","Donald Trump's interest in Russia dates back to Soviet times. In fact, there's extraordinary footage of him shaking hands with Mikhail Gorbachev. It comes from 1988, the peak of perestroika and Gorbachev's efforts to charm the American public.","One of Trump's vulnerabilities is that he doesn't always vet his people, whether it's business partners, the dubious characters he retweets, or the foreign leaders who show up at his door.","An article in the 'Moscow Times' described Trump as the city's first grand builder since Stalin.","Having a friend in the Kremlin would help Trump fulfill his longtime dream of planting his name in the Moscow skyline - a dream that he pursued even as he organized his presidential campaign.","There's an oft-used shorthand for the technologist's view of the world. It is assumed that libertarianism dominates Silicon Valley, and that isn't wholly wrong. High-profile devotees of Ayn Rand can be found there.","Privacy won't survive the present trajectory of technology - and with the sense of being perpetually watched, humans will behave more cautiously, less subversively. Our ideas about the competitive marketplace are at risk.","My hope is that we revive 'monopoly' as a core piece of political rhetoric that broadly denotes dominant firms with pernicious powers.","I have really no desire to go back into management ever again.","Brazil is strewn with ruins of projects - refineries, power plants - begun but never finished. Most of this investment never landed in places or industries that really meshed with the trajectory of the global economy. This wasn't state-of-the art industrial policy. The projects seemed curiously nostalgic.","Trump uses the phrase 'America First,' only dimly aware that he is repeating a phrase from the interwar years and indifferent to its historic resonances. But he compulsively echoes that period - another time when leaders described the world in apocalyptic terms.","The sense of crisis is everything for Trump - even if it's largely invented. His depiction of darkness justifies his candidacy, the need to violently shake the system. His ability to conjure fear is what distinguished him from all those career pols he has vanquished. And it suits his ego.","Putin has made a habit of supporting far-right candidates who undermine his foes in Europe; perhaps he never could have imagined such a character taking root on American soil. Trump's reasons for aligning with Putin have been more innocent, if no less dangerous.","Trump is a real estate guy who sucks up to power to get buildings built.","Mark Zuckerberg talks about telepathy, and Elon Musk has invested in trying to create a brain-machine interface.","My dad has been in the fight against monopoly since it wasn't so cool. I'm sure I've turned to the subject to please him, though I think he might consider some of my arguments a little flamethrowing for his tastes.","If you're presented with choices that steer you toward your worst instincts, that's what you'll choose. If I'm presented with Snickers bars, I won't necessarily seek out kale.","When Trump started belittling him, Jeb reverted to Bush form. He couldn't understand how anyone could question his noble pursuit of public service. In the face of Trump's attacks, he looked hurt and stunned.","The demise of Jeb Bush has been a source of immeasurable pleasure for, well, nearly everyone.","In 2012, Vladimir Putin returned to the presidency after a four-year, constitutionally imposed hiatus. It wasn't the smoothest of transitions. To his surprise, in the run-up to his inauguration, protesters filled the streets of Moscow and other major cities to denounce his comeback.","After the global financial crisis of 2008, populist uprisings had sprouted across Europe. Putin and his strategists sensed the beginnings of a larger uprising that could upend the Continent and make life uncomfortable for his geostrategic competitors.","In mid-2014, 51 percent of American Republicans viewed Putin very unfavorably. Two years later, 14 percent did. By January, 75 percent of Republicans said Trump had the 'right approach' toward Russia."],"Franklin Graham":["You have to look at what a person does with his life. Anyone can say that he's a Christian, but you look at how they live.","Gay couples cannot have children. All they can do is recruit your child.","All I know is that I'm a sinner and that God has forgiven me of my sins. Because I put my faith and trust in Jesus Christ.","I regret any comments I have ever made which may have cast any doubt on the personal faith of our president, Mr. Obama.","We certainly love the Muslim people. But that is not the faith of this country. And that is not the religion that built this nation. The people of the Christian faith and the Jewish faith are the ones who built America, and it is not Islam.","In my opinion, Putin is right on these issues. Obviously, he may be wrong about many things, but he has taken a stand to protect his nation's children from the damaging effects of any gay and lesbian agenda.","Every life is precious to God. God created every one of us. He gave us a soul, and that soul will live as long as God lives.","I just believe as a Christian, we are to show love; we are to show compassion to people, not to point the finger, not to do this, but to do this - to love them, to welcome them, to embrace them.","Rather than seeking to stem the tide, our educators, politicians, and judges aid the advance of godlessness. This cannot continue if our children and grandchildren are to live in a country that still recognises God and upholds religious liberty.","Most Christians would not recognize Mormonism as part of the Christian faith.","I was 22 years old when I asked Christ to come into my heart. You cannot be born a Christian; you can only be converted. And that is by putting your faith and trust in Christ.","There is no question that America has been a nation that has been blessed by almighty God. There is no other nation in the history of mankind that has done what His nation has done - and it's because of God's hand and His blessing.","It's hard to pin down what it means to be an evangelical today. It's been diluted quite a bit. It is a powerful voting bloc, no question, but they're liberal as well as conservative - and they're made of Latinos, blacks, whites.","Jesus wasn't real loving sometimes. He called the Pharisees vipers, snakes, whitewashed tombs. So, you have to understand the world in which we live is dangerous.","God empowered him; and my father, when he stood to preach, he wasn't preaching his message, he was preaching God's message.","I've never really been one to try to be politically correct. I just feel truth is truth, and sometimes I probably offend some people.","Syria, for all its problems, at least has a constitution that guarantees equal protection of citizens. Around the world, we have seen that this is essential where Christians are a minority and are not protected.","God's word is the same, yesterday and today and a million years from now.","I think Newt Gingrich is a Christian; at least, he told me he is.","We have taken God out of our education system. We have taken Him out of government. You have lawyers that sue you every time you mention the name of Jesus Christ in any public forum.","Jesus Christ came for me, and he came for each person that is infected with HIV/AIDS. God loves that person. He doesn't hate them. They've made mistakes. We've all made mistakes. But God loves them, God cares for them, and Jesus Christ died for their sins.","I think AIDS can be won. I think we can win this fight. It is winnable. But it means behavior change.","Everybody's got their phone up and everybody's taking recordings and posting it on YouTube and whatever and sending it to you, and it gets shown around the world.","I saw my father preach in Madison Square Garden, and I was a little embarrassed, I think, the first time I heard him preach. That's my father up there, and I kind of slid down in my chair.","I believe Donald Trump is a good man. He did everything wrong as a candidate, and he won, and I don't understand it. Other than I think God put him there.","The Muslims want to force conversion. Christians want to persuade you to voluntarily change your heart to where you would say yes to Jesus Christ.","We're in a sick world.","Our country's got a sin problem, and I believe if these politicians in Washington would recognize the moral failure of so many of their policies that maybe we could fix it.","We are all flawed people.","I don't condone bad language.","I don't have any faith in the Republican Party. I don't have any faith in the Democrat Party. The only hope for this nation is God.","I don't think I've been to any country where everybody was supportive - there's always churches or groups who don't like my theology or that we associate with this group or that group.","A secular worldview hostile to biblical values has overrun our culture and permeated our government.","Only God can turn our nation and the hearts of its people.","We are losing our country and the freedoms we have enjoyed. As Bible-believing Christians, we are the ones who must take action before it's too late.","The God of Islam is not the same God of the Judaeo-Christian faith. The God that we worship in Christianity is a God that has a Son. To Islam, that is blasphemy, to say that God has a son. Therefore, they do not worship the God that we worship.","I have never really tried to forge my own identity. As followers of Jesus Christ, we ought to forge our identity in Him.","My father has been faithful to the calling that God gave him: that is, to preach the Gospel... He has presented Christ to every person that God has put before him.","I want to take my life and the time I have on this earth to try to tell others about Jesus, that Jesus Christ is God's son who took our sins to the Cross and shed His blood for our sins.","The world is attacking Christians because they hate the name of Christ. And President Trump has been defending Christians.","Billy Graham that the world saw on television or saw on the big screen was the same Billy Graham that we saw at home. He wasn't two people.","When my mother passed away, we knew what she wanted on her tombstone, so I asked my father, so there wouldn't be any argument among us children, 'Daddy, what do you want on your tombstone?' He thought about that. He said, 'preacher.' So that's what's going to be on his tombstone. Preacher.","The man the world knew as Billy Graham was always 'Daddy' to me. I was well into my teens before I fully comprehended that my father had a household name and a worldwide ministry.","During my teens and early 20s, I proved to be anything but what most people expected Billy Graham's son to be. I'm so thankful he never gave up on me or quit loving me.","I'm at least smart enough to know I could never fill Billy Graham's shoes, but I'm grateful he gave me an opportunity to help him finish his race on earth well and to continue his life's work."],"Franklin Knight Lane":["A public office is not a job, it is an opportunity to do something for the public.","Newspaper men, perhaps more than any other class, are rated by ability.","I have hardly seen my baby for six weeks; have been at the office from nine A.M. to eleven P.M. regularly.","No man should have a political office because he wants a job.","It is work and personal worth which make a State great both politically and industrially, and in my estimation they are to be found in largest proportions in the Democratic party.","I am not the flag: not at all.

Love is what makes the ride worthwhile.","Scratch a dog and you'll find a permanent job.","One advantage of talking to yourself is that you know at least somebody's listening.","You never realize what a good memory you have until you try to forget something.","Bravery is being the only one who knows you're afraid.","You can learn many things from children. How much patience you have, for instance.","Originality is the art of concealing your source.","Experience is that marvelous thing that enables you to recognize a mistake when you make it again.","A fanatic is one who sticks to his guns whether they're loaded or not.","Nothing makes it easier to resist temptation than a proper bringing-up, a sound set of values - and witnesses.","Anybody who finds it easy to make money on the horses is probably in the dog food business.","All women should know how to take care of children. Most of them will have a husband some day.","An autobiography usually reveals nothing bad about its writer except his memory.","It's a strange world of language in which skating on thin ice can get you into hot water.","You're an old-timer if you can remember when setting the world on fire was a figure of speech.","The most efficient labor-saving device is still money.","Experience enables you to recognize a mistake when you make it again.","What makes resisting temptation difficult for many people is they don't want to discourage it completely.","One trouble with developing speed reading skills is that by the time you realize a book is boring you've already finished it.","Anybody who thinks talk is cheap should get some legal advice.","Honest criticism is hard to take, particularly from a relative, a friend, an acquaintance or a stranger.","The trouble with being punctual is that nobody's there to appreciate it.","It's the opinion of some that crops could be grown on the moon; which raises the fear that it may not be long before we're paying somebody not to.","Nothing makes you more tolerant of a neighbor's noisy party than being there.","Children are unpredictable.

The histories of all popular governments show absurd is the idea of their attempting to exist without parties.","Frequently the more trifling the subject, the more animated and protracted the discussion."],"Franklin Raines":["Well, you know, we've got a lot of stimulus in the economy already from the tax cut, from the lowered interest rates, and also from the refinancing of mortgages.","And so we have to be careful with looking at additional stimulus that we don't provoke an increase in the bond rate and then offset a lot of the stimulus we've already got.","I think if you go beyond a year - if this continues into the system in the out years, I think there is a risk and that - that we could have a negative reaction in the bond market and that will offset the good that was attempted to be done.","And so the danger for the housing industry is if we see interest rates rise.","Right now we think that rates will stay low, that you'll be able to get a mortgage below seven percent and that's kicked off a refinance boom that's going to put more money in the pockets of consumers.","So from the housing standpoint, steady as you go, I think, would be the best medicine.","Well, I think the best form would be to put money directly in the pockets of consumers.","That is - the reason for that is that home prices are only going to go up. Now, they've never gone down nationwide in our - since we've been keeping track of this.","Well, we're just now seeing the reductions in mortgage rates. The mortgage rates are based on the ten-year rate and the Fed controls the overnight or the shorter rates.","We think if the economy remains weak that we could see mortgage rates trail down and we think that we could see rates below seven percent into early next year.","They flooded liquidity in the marketplace but the mortgage rate is based much more on expectations of inflation. So if the average investor believes that there is inflation coming, they'll move that rate up.","Right now the long-term investors are telling us that they're not as concerned about inflation and so we're seeing these rates now move into the marketplace and out to the street - rates that individuals can get.","Well, I think as long as people are talking about stimulus, I think the Fed will be thinking about cutting rates because monetary policy is the better way to go because you can turn it on and turn it off.","And so Fannie Mae produces very strong results for investors in - when interest rates are high and when interest rates are low, in recession and during booms.","Well, now, and there's - for every dollar the federal government spends, there's real people on the other side, and so when we talk about reductions that are going to affect providers, that's going to affect hospitals and doctors and others.","We are shrinking the size of the federal government as a percent of our economy from over 21 percent of the economy to 19 percent of the economy. At the same time, we're growing the private economy.","Well, there are about 10 million children that aren't covered by health insurance. About 3 million qualify for Medicaid but don't get it, so we're going to reach out and bring more of those kids into the Medicaid program.","The automatic stabilizer is unemployment insurance, food stamps, additional coverage of Medicaid.","If there's a severe recession, the automatic stabilizers will come into effect, and we will still try to reduce the structural deficit, but we will not try to keep cutting the budget so that we keep worsening a severe recession."],"Frans Lanting":["Biodiversity starts in the distant past and it points toward the future.","Tourism is important because it can create sustainable local economies. I'd much rather have 1,000 tourists going up the Tambopata than 1,000 gold miners.","Water is the key to life, but in frozen form, it is a latent force. And when it vanishes, Earth becomes Mars.","I think a photograph, of whatever it might be - a landscape, a person - requires personal involvement. That means knowing your subject, not just snapping at what's in front of you.","Nature's my muse and it's been my passion.","The Galapagos Islands provide a window on time. In a geologic sense, the islands are young, yet they appear ancient.","I want to interpret the natural world and our links to it. It's driven by the belief of many world-class scientists that we're in the midst of an extinction crisis... This time it's us that's doing it.","Life needs a membrane to contain itself so it can replicate and mutate.","A lion is not a lion is not a lion. As individuals, as mates, as members of a society, they're all very different.","My wife says that I become different once I start to work with animals. My movements become different, my mood is different. It involves letting everything fall behind you, becoming intuitive in your dealings with wild creatures in a way that bypasses reason. Sometimes it's more like a dance than anything else.","I became interested in photography during my first visit to the United States. I was a student at a university in Holland. I was overwhelmed by the beauty of the American West. That was when I learned about the tradition of nature in American photography.","Life is a force in its own right. It is a new element. And it has altered the Earth. It covers Earth like a skin."],"Frans de Waal":["Human morality is unthinkable without empathy.","I am personally not against keeping animals at zoos, as they serve a huge educational purpose, but treating them well and with respect seems the least we could do, and with 'we' I mean not just zoo staff, but most certainly also the public.","Octopuses have hundreds of suckers, each one equipped with its own ganglion with thousands of neurons. These 'mini-brains' are interconnected, making for a widely distributed nervous system. That is why a severed octopus arm may crawl on its own and even pick up food.","Female bonobos form a strong sisterhood. They rule through female solidarity.","After World War II it was decided that, in order to prevent the Germans and the French from having another war, it would be better to tie them together into one economic pact so they would invest in each other and have mutual stakes. Until now, that has worked to prevent warfare between the two.","Scientists are supposed to study animals in a totally objective fashion, similar to the way we inspect a rock or measure the circumference of a tree trunk. Emotions are not to interfere with the assessment. The animal-rights movement capitalizes on this perception, depicting scientists as devoid of compassion.","It is well known that apes in the wild offer spontaneous assistance to each other, defending against leopards, say, or consoling distressed companions with tender embraces.","Our brains have been designed to blur the line between self and other. It is an ancient neural circuitry that marks every mammal, from mouse to elephant.","Unlike the primate hand, the elephant's grasping organ is also its nose. Elephants use their trunks not only to reach food but also to sniff and touch it. With their unparalleled sense of smell, the animals know exactly what they are going for. Vision is secondary.","The sturdiest pillars of human morality are compassion and a sense of justice.","The term 'alpha female' originated in my field of animal behavior, but has acquired new meaning. It refers to women who are in charge, for example, by flirting and dating on their own terms. It is also used maliciously for a loud-mouthed, controlling woman who has no patience with deviating opinions.","The more self-aware an animal is, the more empathetic it tends to be.","Popular culture bombards us with examples of animals being humanized for all sorts of purposes, ranging from education to entertainment to satire to propaganda. Walt Disney, for example, made us forget that Mickey is a mouse, and Donald a duck. George Orwell laid a cover of human societal ills over a population of livestock.","Religion looms as large as an elephant in the United States, to the point that being nonreligious is about the biggest handicap a politician running for office can have, bigger than being gay, unmarried, thrice married, or black.","People want to work with somebody who feels shame, who worries about the perceptions of others. Dishonesty is something we don't like in others.","The enemy of science is not religion. Religion comes in endless shapes and forms... The true enemy is the substitution of thought, reflection, and curiosity with dogma.","Most exotic animals are not particularly interested in people, which makes it hard to provoke them. Human-rearing gets them used to and sometimes imprinted on humans, which makes them potentially dangerous.","I think we need to start thinking about grounding our moral systems in our biology.","Religion may have become a codification of morality, and it may fortify it, but it's not the origin of it.","If you look at national economies today, for example, the American economy, the European economy, the Indians, the Chinese, we're all tied together. If one of them sinks, the rest are going to sink with them and if one floats, the rest are lifted up. I find that very interesting.","The whole reason people fill their homes with furry carnivores and not with, say, iguanas and turtles, is because mammals offer something no reptile ever will. They give affection, they want affection, and respond to our emotions the way we do to theirs.","If one bird foraging in a flock on the ground suddenly takes off, all other birds will take off immediately after, before they even know what's going on. The one who stays behind may be prey.","What is the evolutionary value of blushing? It seems not to be to our advantage to do it, to involuntarily reveal our inner emotions. If we're trying to manipulate or lie, actions in furtherance of individual goals as opposed to the goals of others, blushing would not seem to be helpful. And yet everyone blushes, except the psychopath.","I have often noticed how primate groups in their entirety enter a similar mood. All of a sudden, all of them are playful, hopping around. Or all of them are grumpy. Or all of them are sleepy and settle down. In such cases, the mood contagion serves the function of synchronizing activities.","Empathy probably started out as a mechanism to improve maternal care. Mammalian mothers who were attentive to their young's needs were more likely to rear successful offspring.","Chimps don't have language. Humans actively instruct others about how things should be done. Chimpanzees probably pick up cultural traditions by observation.","The primate laugh is given in playful contexts, and as such has a strong similarity to the human laugh.","The intuitive connection children feel with animals can be a tremendous source of joy. The unconditional love received from pets, and the lack of artifice in the relationship, contrast sharply with the much trickier dealings with members of their own species.","Exclusive homosexuality is not very common in nature.","If you look at human society, it is very easy, of course, to compare our warfare and territoriality with the chimpanzee. But that's only one side of what we do. We also trade, we intermarry, we allow each other to travel through our territory. There's an enormous amount of cooperation.","Chimps cannot tell us anything about peaceful relations, because chimps have only different degrees of hostility between communities. Whereas bonobos do tell us something; they tell us about the possibility of having peaceful relationships.","Bonobo studies started in the '70s and came to fruition in the '80s. Then in the '90s, all of a sudden, boom, they ended because of the warfare in the Congo. It was really bad for the bonobo and ironic that people with their warfare were preventing us from studying the hippies of the primate world.","The fact that the apes exist and that we can study them is extremely important and makes us reflect on ourselves and our human nature. In that sense alone, you need to protect the apes.","Very long ago our ancestors had moral systems. Our current institutions are only a couple of thousand years old, which is really not old in the eyes of a biologist.","I'm personally a nonbeliever, so I'm struggling with if we really need religion.","Personally, I think it is possible to build a society that is moral on a nonreligious basis, but the jury is still out on that.","You should know as much as you can about the human species if you have a hand in designing human society.","I think the sense of fairness in humans is very strongly developed, and that's why we react so strongly to all the bonuses received by Wall Street executives. We want to know why they deserve these benefits.","If there is any form of contagion that is adaptive, it is the immediate response to the fear of others. If others are fearful, there may be good reason for you to be fearful too.","Darwin wasn't just provocative in saying that we descend from the apes - he didn't go far enough. We are apes in every way, from our long arms and tailless bodies to our habits and temperament.","Humans have a lot of pro-social tendencies.","I describe in 'Chimpanzee Politics' how the alpha male needs broad support to reach the top spot. He needs some close allies and he needs many group members to be on his side.","Male chimpanzees have an extraordinarily strong drive for dominance. They're constantly jockeying for position.","The thinking is that we started evolving language not by speaking but by gesturing.","The role of inequity in society is grossly underestimated. Inequity is not good for your health, basically.","Very ancient parts of the brain are involved in moral decision making.","War is evitable if conditions are such that the costs of making war are higher than the benefits.","There is little evidence that other animals judge the appropriateness of actions that do not directly affect themselves.","There's a long tradition in Western thought that humans are not shackled by biology, whereas animals are pure instinct machines.","There are beautiful examples of art done by chimpanzees in human care.","Following rules is, of course, the reason the dog is man's best friend is because the dog follows rules, and they actually do experiments on that, is that how well certain breeds of dogs follow rules, and how much they internalize them. And so many hierarchical animals, obviously they follow rules.","Science is not inherently good.","Sometimes I read about someone saying with great authority that animals have no intentions and no feelings, and I wonder, 'Doesn't this guy have a dog?'","Chimpanzees, typically, kiss and embrace after fights. They first make eye contact from a distance to see the mood of the others. Then they approach and kiss and embrace.","In Africa, we have the bush meat trade, which means that, on a very large scale, animals are being killed in the forests and sold in the cities as a luxury food.","Chimpanzees have very strong preferences and aversions that are completely personality-linked. The people who are unsuccessful in working with chimpanzees are those who take this personally.","When humans behave murderously, such as inflicting senseless slaughter of innocents in warfare, we like to blame it on some dark, 'animalistic' instinct.","Religions have a strong binding function and a cohesive element. They emphasize the primacy of the community as opposed to the individual, and they also help set one community apart from another that doesn't share their beliefs.","Understanding the need for religion is a far superior goal to bashing it.","There are many reasons for kindness, and religion is just one of them.","We need to separate the process of evolution - which is, indeed, a self-serving process - and the actual motivations of animals.","Many economists are great believers in the idea that everything in nature is competitive and that we should set up a society which is competitive to reflect that. Anyone who cannot keep up, well, too bad.","Although elephants are far more distantly related to us than the great apes, they seem to have evolved similar social and cognitive capacities.","There has been so much underestimating of animal cognition that to perhaps overestimate it, as I probably do, is probably a healthy reaction.","Male bonobos really don't fit the human male ideal.","A chimpanzee who is really gearing up for a fight doesn't waste time with gestures but just goes ahead and attacks.","Closeness to animals creates the desire to understand them, and not just a little piece of them, but the whole animal. It makes us wonder what goes on in their heads even though we fully realize that the answer can only be approximated.","One thing bothered me as a student. In the 1960s, human behavior was totally off limits for the biologist. There was animal behavior, then there was a long time nothing, after which came human behavior as a totally separate category best left to a different group of scientists.","Experiments with animals have long been handicapped by our anthropocentric attitude: We often test them in ways that work fine with humans but not so well with other species.","I was born in Den Bosch, where the painter Hieronymus Bosch named himself after. And so I've always been very fond of this painter who lived and worked in the 15th century.","Deep down, creationists realize they will never win factual arguments with science. This is why they have construed their own science-like universe, known as Intelligent Design, and eagerly jump on every tidbit of information that seems to go their way.","Future benefits rarely figure in the minds of animals.","I was raised Catholic. Not just a little bit Catholic, like my wife, Catherine. When she was young, many Catholics in France already barely went to church, except for the big three: baptism, marriage, and funeral. And only the middle one was by choice.","I was too restless as a boy to sit through an entire mass. It was akin to aversion training. I looked at it like a puppet show with a totally predictable story line. The only aspect I really liked was the music.","Dogmatists have one advantage: they are poor listeners.","It is hard to get animals which normally pay little attention to each other to do things together. One can teach dolphins to jump simultaneously out of the water precisely because they show similar behavior spontaneously, but try to make two domestic cats jump together and you will fail."],"Frans van Houten":["If we are to ensure that healthcare remains affordable and widely available for future generations, we need to radically rethink how we provide and manage it - in collaboration with key health system partners - and apply the technology that can help achieve these changes.","Even though we live in a fast-changing world with short term-ism all around, it requires years of determination to transform a company and structurally reap the rewards. Innovation companies need to set their sights on solving unmet needs - but this approach requires focus and long-term tenacity.","Engagement with young people is always a refreshing break with routine. It's also a reminder of how we need to constantly keep our thinking agile and unencumbered by traditional rules.","Genomics, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Machine learning technologies are helping practitioners deliver better diagnosis and actually freeing up time for patient interaction.","First and foremost, we must take a more holistic view of patient care journeys and then better integrate workflows and technology so that the care experience is seamless and provided at the location where it makes most sense.","With access to professional coaching and support around the clock, patients will feel more empowered to manage their own physical wellbeing.","As humans, we've always innovated our way out of problems, whether it was the first torch to light a dark cave or the steam engine that sparked a revolution.","We undertook a huge internal transformation to sharpen our customer focus, step up innovation, improve productivity to ensure competitiveness, change our culture, and simplify our ways of working so that our size and scale became a competitive advantage rather than a bureaucratic hangover after years of diversification.","In an aging world with more chronic disease, health and healthcare are enormous opportunities that we want to focus on.","Like all major transitions in human history, the shift from a linear to a circular economy will be a tumultuous one. It will feature heroes and pioneers, naysayers and obstacles, and moments of victory and doubt. If we persevere, however, we will put our economy back on a path of growth and sustainability.","The traditional way that society looks at healthcare is to let people get terribly sick and then have an emergency room to take care of them and spend a lot of money on acute care for people who would have been kept out of hospital in the first place if they had had a lifestyle change.","Health care has to be delivered as an integrated service across the entire continuum of care. This runs from healthy living and prevention to diagnosis and treatment and recovery and homecare.","Meaningful innovation can be an important catalyst in encouraging resilience in seniors, keeping them independent and engaged.","Compassion, together with contractual responsibility for one's workforce, is a mark of a top employer.","Employers can assist employees in looking after their health by giving guidance on energy management, sleep and healthy eating, working relationships, and helping maintain a sense of purpose at work.","Government should seek more strategic approaches to developing dynamic, resilient infrastructure. Business must be more creative in offering financing solutions as partners with government, and people must support sustainable innovation as a public policy priority.","When you make a courageous statement, people start to follow you, and that's nice.","Sustainable solutions based on innovation can create a more resilient world only if that innovation is focused on the health and well-being of its inhabitants. And it is at that point - where technology and human needs intersect - that we will find meaningful innovation.","Should one of your employees have a physical or mental health problem, I would argue that it is as much something for the employer as the individual to contend with.","By innovating and investing in health technology, we believe that we can really change the future of health.","We knew we could put the company on the right side of history by decisive transformative action and by redefining our purpose to improving people's lives through innovation.","Thanks to the digital and big data revolution, we can start to do what was previously unthinkable - to improve patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs while delivering personalized care to each individual.","The computer can do a much better job than the human eye, as it is much more systematic in analysing tissues.","It is vital that a company's culture shows a willingness to invest in employee wellbeing with no stigma or penalty attached to prioritising good health.","What Philips has to offer to India is to further enhance the state of healthcare for the over billion people in this country.","Certain product categories become less attractive for us because, as they become mature, they become low-cost, and hence, there is less to invent. There is less to invent in a television, whereas in heath technology, there is a lot to invent. So we wanted to put our innovative power to work where it really matters.","If we can keep you healthy, that is better. If you fall sick, you go to the hospital. Both sides, Philips is present.","Our health underpins our happiness and is a foundation of economic advancement.","Indeed, the Fourth Industrial Revolution will greatly lead to increased consumer health awareness and self-management and will enable individualized treatment pathways supported by tele-health care and coaching.","Poor diet and sedentary behaviour have led to an increase in obesity and lifestyle-related disease and a huge rise in chronic medical conditions.","Healthcare continues to move outside the hospital and into our homes and everyday lives. With leading doctors and psychologists, for example, we've developed personal health programs designed around patients to catalyze sustainable behavioural change.","Growing and aging populations are putting increased pressure on health-care systems that are already buckling under the burden of chronic diseases like cancer and diabetes.","If we are to ensure that health care remains affordable and widely available for future generations, we need to rethink radically how we provide and manage it.","Crucially, healthcare needs to become connected. It should become effortless for medical professionals to share relevant data with colleagues around the world. Medical devices and systems in hospitals should be able to combine multiple sources of information.","In Kenya, e-learning has taught 12,000 nurses how to treat major diseases such as HIV and malaria, compared to the 100 nurses a year that can be taught in a classroom.","Perhaps sooner than we think, African innovations will help the rest of the world create lasting social and economic value.","Our myopic focus on producing and consuming as cheaply as possible has created a linear economy in which objects are briefly used and then discarded as waste.","Waste does not exist in nature because ecosystems reuse everything that grows in a never-ending cycle of efficiency and purpose.","Philips is committed to the circular economy and is applying its principles throughout the organization. We are redesigning our products and looking at ways to capture their residual value.","Government should create the environment and incentives to stimulate investment in sustainable innovation, take away barriers, and accelerate adoption, even in turbulent economic times.","Changing the ways of governments usually doesn't happen quickly, but time is a luxury the world no longer enjoys.","Time may not be on our side, but innovation is.","City farming is not only possible, it is the very definition of the kind of meaningful, sustainable innovation we will need to meet the grand challenges of the 21st century: climate change; population growth; ageing population; urbanization; rising demand for energy, food and water; poverty; and access to healthcare.","Healthcare is a conservative marketplace.","Insurers reimburse critical care, not the avoidance of incidents. Therefore, investments are not targeted towards prevention.","Concerns about the possible side-effects of connected care are swept aside by the expectations of the benefits when people are confronted with a chronic disease themselves. Resistance that could be privacy-related completely disappears.","I remain convinced of the compelling case for connected care.","Tech can help population health, make health more accessible, more affordable. Tech can also get people get more included in the economy and contribute and drive growth, and growth and wealth are great contributors to a safer world.","When I became CEO, I was really worried that we were in commoditized segments that were mature and no longer growing. So we made a radical pivot into health technology because that is one of the world's unmet needs.","Our strategy is focused on driving better outcomes for patients and higher productivity for hospitals.","It has not escaped us that other competitors have also identified health as an attractive marketplace.","Having a consumer brand helps us a lot. We will see more ambulatory care, and there will be a lot of new ways to deliver healthcare... and that means consumerism is going to play a bigger role.","Great companies need to reinvent themselves. We can do that: we can stay relevant, we can grow, and we can stay successful. It takes courage, but it's a path we've been preparing for carefully.","The entire dynamics of the lighting market are changing. Value is moving toward systems and services.","We are very optimistic about our opportunities in China. Our toothbrushes continue to sell very well, while the growth of private hospitals diminishes the risk of government preferring domestic suppliers.","The conventional way of selling products out of the catalogue no longer works; the relationship needs to become more sticky.","Minimally invasive surgery is the way forward: the patient goes home the next day; there are fewer complications.","We typically sell a catheter lab to a hospital, and it sits there for the next 10 years, and we don't visit the cardiologist on a daily basis. Volcano have a disposable business. They are in the cath lab on a daily basis.","There's much unlocked potential in Philips.","The agreement to acquire Volcano significantly advances our strategy to become the leading systems integrator in image-guided therapies.","I am pleased with the response of investors towards Philips Lighting and the successful pricing of the I.P.O. This strategic milestone will allow Royal Philips to focus on the fast-growing health technology market.","You can't have a single design for all cities. The look and feel of the streetlights are very important.","I think, going forward, we need to be much more modest on expectations with regard to China growth: That's just being realistic.","You need to dismount when your horse is dead. What was relevant 20 years ago is no longer relevant today. Therefore, you need to reinvent yourself.","We can only compete in the world against competitors from Asia, the United States, or wherever if we look at unmet needs.","I think of the world as geographical regions, and it excites me to think about the opportunity that Europe can have if we consider it to be the 500-million-people region that it is.","We can squabble between the siblings in Europe and not be very productive and then see China and the U.S. win over the European region. Or - and this is my preferred choice - we team up together and are the strong region that we want to be, using each others' strengths and building on our commonalities to become the smartest region in the world.","At the core, Philips is an innovation company. And for innovation to work, you need to look for the unmet needs.","We invented television and stuck with it for 50 years, and then I decided to get out of that. I would like people to know that we are broader than consumer electronics.","Light is one of the basic areas that will give you comfort, but it is undergoing a technological revolution in moving from conventional lighting to semiconductor-based lighting, and as it does that, it is becoming intelligent with the transition from analogue to digital.","We have transformed Philips into a focused leader in health technology, delivering innovation to help people manage their health.","The global healthcare industry is undergoing a paradigm shift, providing significant opportunities for Philips to deliver more integrated solutions across the continuum of care - from prevention, diagnosis, and treatment to monitoring and aftercare.","To become the global leader in HealthTech and shape the future of the industry, we will combine our vibrant Healthcare and Consumer Lifestyle businesses into one company.","Philips is uniquely positioned to help reshape and optimize population health management by leveraging big data and delivering care across the health continuum, from healthy living and prevention to diagnosis, minimally invasive treatment, recovery, and home care.","A siloed approach between suppliers doesn't really help hospitals well enough.","I've always flagged that it will take some time to gradually sell down our interest in lighting and basically pivot to be a medtech company focused entirely on health technology.","Lumileds is a highly successful supplier of lighting components to the general illumination, automotive, and consumer electronics markets, with a strong customer base.","In the Asian marketplace, we need to come out with products every nine months, not every two years.","The shift in demand is toward partners that can improve productivity, and in part, that can be done by software.","Price erosion in components is quite fast. If you can capitalize on that by bringing products to the market faster, you will actually gain a better margin realization.","We are addressing duplication and complexity. At the same time, we are investing more in research and development, speeding up the time to market of new innovations, and expanding our sales force in markets where growth is to be found, like Turkey, Russia, the Mideast, China, and southeast Asia.","Healthy people are not very motivated to manage their health. They just don't care.","When you try to master the emotions of a decision and say, if you're 50 years from now and you look back, 'Did we take the right decisions?' Then the decision becomes a lot easier.","In the back of my mind was the nagging discussion: where do we take the portfolio? You can get rid of TV, fine, but then you are in lighting and in health, and those don't have a lot to do with each other.","I came back to Philips and quickly realised that the TV business had a major performance issue and some structural challenges. Rather than try to tweak it and sit things out, we said we had to go for a structural solution.","We started experimenting with television in 1928. For a lot of people, Philips has a lot to do with TV.","Sometimes that Dutch consensus approach doesn't move you forward fast enough.","How can we keep people healthy, and if they get sick, how can we treat them right the first time?","As soon as a disease is diagnosed, we still need someone to deliver the care.","If we are going to get a grip on escalating costs, we have to focus more on prevention rather than acute care. Technology can help us do that.","We can't think in terms of designing products that we throw over the wall to customers, but instead, we need to design products that are upgradable and maintainable and that can be mined for materials and components that can be reused."],"Frantz Fanon":["He who is reluctant to recognize me opposes me.","I ascribe a basic importance to the phenomenon of language. To speak means to be in a position to use a certain syntax, to grasp the morphology of this or that language, but it means above all to assume a culture, to support the weight of a civilization.","However painful it may be for me to accept this conclusion, I am obliged to state it: for the black man there is only one destiny. And it is white.","Fervor is the weapon of choice of the impotent.","There is a point at which methods devour themselves.","Violence is man re-creating himself.","For the black man there is only one destiny. And it is white."],"Franz Beckenbauer":["Rugby is a different game. There is an interruption every two minutes also in American football. Our soccer is a moving game: play, play, play, move, move - you don't interrupt.","The Olympic stadium may have been built only in the early 1970s but it was clear for a long time it had no future. For many reasons it is not good enough for modern football and today's fans.","At least six Bayern players, who have won almost everything, are in the national squad.","It would make me a lot happier if I could meet up again next year with as many friends as possible from all over the world who I've met during my career. That's where the great opportunity lies, for me personally, in our role as World Cup host.","At any rate, I can only see such a success having positive effects for everyone, particularly as our anticipation of the World cup would only increase further.","At the World Cup and even now at the Confederations Cup, our security provisions will ensure the greatest level of protection possible for all those participating - both inside and outside the stadiums.","The most important thing however is the money. What use would it be to us, to have a a mighty stadium but a useless team, because we couldn't afford anything better?","Certainly it is a different world for players nowadays. But it depends on the individual.","For example, Michael Jordan earns $100million a year but continues to play basketball and remains a modest human being.","Since Sven Goran Eriksson took over, England have been fantastic.","We should not fool ourselves. We are not one of the world's top teams any more.","Back then, a half-a-century ago, the situation was totally different. Economically, we were practically on our knees, and politically, we were still excluded from the community of nations. Today, in this respect, we have a totally different and much more stable basis.","The trouble for today's footballers is they have too many distractions. We used to get our old players coming to watch training with football magazines in their hands. Now, more often than not, they are checking the share prices.","The two designs are completely different. The first is totally futuristic, the second is more classical. You can of course get very excited about doing something completely out of the ordinary, just like the Olympic stadium in its time. But each to his or her own taste.","The World Cup tournament overall and, naturally, the new stadiums at its heart, are the ideal platform to portray Germany as a positive and exceptional location, and above all of course, as a highly capable economic location.","We are the last remaining country to allow ourselves two breaks in the season. You just have to look at England, Italy and Spain, they play right through the season. We on the other hand take six weeks off in the winter until the end of January, and that is a luxury.","In the World Cup, much depends for every team on how it develops during the tournament. There are always rising tensions. They come from within, and they come from the media.","I kept my speeches short as captain. I focused on the key points of the opposition of the day. As coach, I was never afraid to give long speeches to the players throughout our preparations. It was important they had all the information possible.","German football is like English football. The Germans and the English do not play like a Brazilian side. They have to improve, bring up their young players, who have character.","If a Middle Eastern sheikh comes to buy Bayern Munich, he could buy 49 per cent. Fifty-one per cent must stay in Germany with the club. That law came about because of the developments of international football."],"Franz Boas":["Furthermore, the study of the present surroundings is insufficient: the history of the people, the influence of the regions through which it has passed on its migrations, and the people with whom it came into contact, must be considered.","I hope I may have succeeded in presenting to you, however imperfectly, the currents of thought due to the work of the immortal Darwin which have helped to make anthropology what it is at the present time.","If we were to select the most intelligent, imaginative, energetic, and emotionally stable third of mankind, all races would be present.","It is our task to inquire into the causes that have brought about the observed differentiation, and to investigate the sequence of events that have led to the establishment of the multifarious forms of human life.","We do not discuss the anatomical, physiological, and mental characteristics of man considered as an individual; but we are interested in the diversity of these traits in groups of men found in different geographical areas and in different social classes.","The historical development of the work of anthropologists seems to single out clearly a domain of knowledge that heretofore has not been treated by any other science.","I object to teaching of slogans intended to befog the mind, of whatever kind they may be.","The disease of mutual distrust among nations is the bane of modern civilization.","We all know scientists who in private life do not come up to the standard of truthfulness, but who, nevertheless, would not consciously falsify the results of their researches.","This idea was also brought out very clearly by Wallace, who emphasized that apparently reasonable activities of man might very well have developed without an actual application of reasoning.","Remember that in every single case in history the process of adaptation has been one of exceeding slowness. Do not look for the impossible, but do not let your path deviate from the quiet and steadfast insistence on full opportunities for your powers.","Not so the scientist. The very essence of his life is the service of truth.","My parents had broken through the shackles of dogma.","My father had retained an emotional affection for the ceremonial of his parental home, without allowing it to influence his intellectual freedom.","In other words, we are interested in the anatomical and mental characteristics of men living under the same biological, geographical, and social environment, and as determined by their past.","In France, that let down the barriers more than a hundred years ago, the feeling of antipathy is still strong enough to sustain an anti-Jewish political party."],"Franz Drameh":["There is a very diverse range of superheroes, especially with the Firestorm character. In the comics, there is a black Firestorm. But we still don't see that many black superheroes. So what The CW is doing and what DC Comics is doing with this whole universe with diversity is absolutely amazing.","Changes can be made. New decisions can be made. If people say, 'It's not like that in the comics!' Well, comic books reinvent their characters a lot. They do different things with them all the time. They're always changing, always keeping things fresh. So that shouldn't be an issue if the race changes for a character.","I'd really love to check out medieval times. I'm obsessed with that kind of stuff, like on a horseback with a sword.","I'm always trying to play pranks on people and doing silliness, singing extremely badly and extremely loudly on set."],"Franz Grillparzer":["Genius unrefined resembles a flash of lightning, but wisdom is like the sun.","I look around me and nowhere do I see a stamp of disapproval with which nature marked a woman's candid brow.","Science and art, or by the same token, poetry and prose differ from one another like a journey and an excursion. The purpose of the journey is its goal, the purpose of an excursion is the process.","To test a modest man's modesty do not investigate if he ignores applause, find out if he abides criticism.","Drink and be thankful to the host!

But a monkey looking into a work of literature looks in vain for Socrates.","This searching and doubting and vacillating where nothing is clear but the arrogance of quest. I, too, had such noble ideas when I was still a boy.","It's the misfortune of German authors that not a single one of them dares to expose his true character. Everyone thinks that he has to be better than he is.","You even called me stupid in your verse, and I'm almost agreeing, for where stupidity is involved, you are quite an expert, friend.","Without a notion of the transcendental, human beings would, indeed, be animals; however, only fools can be convinced of it, and only degenerates need such a conviction.","Mankind is getting smarter every day. Actually, it only seems so. At least we are making progress. We're progressing, to be sure, ever more deeply into the forest.","Whoever places his trust into a system will soon be without a home. While you are building your third story, the two lower ones have already been dismantled.","To declaim freedom verses seems like a poem within a poem; freedom requires guns, it requires arms, but no feet.","Before passing different laws for different people, I'd relinquish myself unto you as your slave.","Ideas are not thoughts; the thought respects the boundaries that the idea ignores thereby failing to realize itself.","Prose talks and poetry sings.","There shall be no slave in your home, male or female: Least of all the mother of your son.","Those who want to row on the ocean of human knowledge do not get far, and the storm drives those out of their course who set sail.","The main reason why men and women make different aesthetic judgments is the fact that the latter, generally incapable of abstraction, only admire what meets their complete approval.","If we notice a few errors in the work of a proven master, we may and even will often be correct; if we believe, however, that he is completely and utterly mistaken, we are in danger of missing his entire concept.","Progress will always have as its recourse to exaggerate what it cannot surpass."],"Franz Halder":["The reason is that a military defeat of Britain will bring about the disintegration of the British Empire.

I, however, cannot force myself to use drugs to cheat on my loneliness - it is all that I have - and when the drugs and alcohol dissipate, will be all that my peers have as well.","So long as you have food in your mouth, you have solved all questions for the time being.","By believing passionately in something that still does not exist, we create it. The nonexistent is whatever we have not sufficiently desired.","It is not necessary that you leave the house. Remain at your table and listen. Do not even listen, only wait. Do not even wait, be wholly still and alone. The world will present itself to you for its unmasking, it can do no other, in ecstasy it will writhe at your feet.","You do not need to leave your room.

That is the point that must be reached.","Evil is whatever distracts.","A stair not worn hollow by footsteps is, regarded from its own point of view, only a boring something made of wood.","One of the first signs of the beginning of understanding is the wish to die.","Anyone who cannot come to terms with his life while he is alive needs one hand to ward off a little his despair over his fate... but with his other hand he can note down what he sees among the ruins.","It is often safer to be in chains than to be free.","Hiding places there are innumerable, escape is only one, but possibilities of escape, again, are as many as hiding places.","Atlas was permitted the opinion that he was at liberty, if he wished, to drop the Earth and creep away; but this opinion was all that he was permitted.","The history of mankind is the instant between two strides taken by a traveler.","Suffering is the positive element in this world, indeed it is the only link between this world and the positive.","In the struggle between yourself and the world second the world.","Believing in progress does not mean believing that any progress has yet been made.","The spirit becomes free only when it ceases to be a support.","Martyrs do not underrate the body, they allow it to be elevated on the cross. In this they are at one with their antagonists.","The indestructible is one: it is each individual human being and, at the same time, it is common to all, hence the incomparably indivisible union that exists between human beings.","My guiding principle is this: Guilt is never to be doubted.","There is nothing besides a spiritual world; what we call the world of the senses is the Evil in the spiritual world, and what we call Evil is only the necessity of a moment in our eternal evolution.","Self-control means wanting to be effective at some random point in the infinite radiations of my spiritual existence.","In the fight between you and the world, back the world.","You can hold yourself back from the sufferings of the world, that is something you are free to do and it accords with your nature, but perhaps this very holding back is the one suffering you could avoid.","One advantage in keeping a diary is that you become aware with reassuring clarity of the changes which you constantly suffer.","The mediation by the serpent was necessary.

Anyone who keeps the ability to see beauty never grows old.","Productivity is being able to do things that you were never able to do before.","There are only two things. Truth and lies.

I would spend all of my time wanting things.","Always first draw fresh breath after outbursts of vanity and complacency.","In argument similes are like songs in love; they describe much, but prove nothing.","Tyranny or slavery, born of selfishness, are the two educational methods of parents; all gradations of tyranny or slavery.","Sensual love deceives one as to the nature of heavenly love; it could not do so alone, but since it unconsciously has the element of heavenly love within it, it can do so.","Idleness is the beginning of all vice, the crown of all virtues.","My 'fear' is my substance, and probably the best part of me.","Dread of night. Dread of not-night.","The experience of life consists of the experience which the spirit has of itself in matter and as matter, in mind and as mind, in emotion, as emotion, etc.","May I kiss you then? On this miserable paper? I might as well open the window and kiss the night air.","We are sinful not only because we have eaten of the Tree of Knowledge, but also because we have not yet eaten of the Tree of Life.

My life is a hesitation before birth.","Woman, or more precisely put, perhaps, marriage, is the representative of life with which you are meant to come to terms.","It is comforting to reflect that the disproportion of things in the world seems to be only arithmetical.","Heaven is dumb, echoing only the dumb.","The decisive moment in human evolution is perpetual. That is why the revolutionary spiritual movements that declare all former things worthless are in the right, for nothing has yet happened.","Test yourself on mankind. It is something that makes the doubter doubt, the believer believe.","How can one take delight in the world unless one flees to it for refuge?","Association with human beings lures one into self-observation.","How pathetically scanty my self-knowledge is compared with, say, my knowledge of my room. There is no such thing as observation of the inner world, as there is of the outer world.","Let me remind you of the old maxim: people under suspicion are better moving than at rest, since at rest they may be sitting in the balance without knowing it, being weighed together with their sins.","In theory there is a possibility of perfect happiness: To believe in the indestructible element within one, and not to strive towards it.","Don't despair, not even over the fact that you don't despair.","No sooner said than done - so acts your man of worth.","If it had been possible to build the Tower of Babel without climbing it, it would have been permitted.","One must not cheat anyone, not even the world of its victory.","The fact that our task is exactly commensurate with our life gives it the appearance of being infinite.","Writers speak stench.","One tells as few lies as possible only by telling as few lies as possible, and not by having the least possible opportunity to do so.","The Bible is a sanctum; the world, sputum.","Religions get lost as people do.","In a certain sense the Good is comfortless.","Hesitation before birth.

The shapes and transitory forms of life are but stages toward this Ideal, which Christ's religion illuminates with His divine light.","Real men are sadly lacking in this world, for when they are put to the test they prove worthless.","We need improvement in the style of performance. There is no more advantage in a musician who plays and conducts than in one who is only a beater of rhythm.","The principal task of a conductor is not to put himself in evidence but to disappear behind his functions as much as possible.

Only I could perform certain works with the scanty means that I dared not ask anyone else to work with.","The public is always good.","The music of the Gypsies belongs in the sphere of improvisation rather than in any other, without which it would have no power to exist.","It is my fervent wish and my greatest ambition to leave a work with a few useful instructions for the pianists after me.","Inspiration is enough to give expression to the tone in singing, especially when the song is without words.","In Hungary all native music, in its origin, is divided naturally into melody destined for song or melody for the dance.","I foster a sorrowful conception of affection. Make no sacrifices.","I did not compose my work as one might put on a church vestment... rather it sprung from the truly fervent faith of my heart, such as I have felt it since my childhood.","I conclude that the Wagnerian operas which are already in the repertoire, and other masterworks as well, stand in no further need of my services.","Companions, in misery and worse, that is what we all are, and to try to change this substantially avails us nothing.","Brahms' Variations are better than mine, but mine were written before his.","As the mother teaches her children how to express themselves in their language, so one Gypsy musician teaches the other. They have never shown any need for notation.","A person of any mental quality has ideas of his own. This is common sense."],"Franz Marc":["Blue is the male principle, stern and spiritual. Yellow the female principle, gentle, cheerful and sensual.

We look for and paint this inner, spiritual side of nature.","We are staunch and true and in rather a champagne mood.","What appears spectral today will be natural tomorrow.","Like everything genuine, its inner life guarantees its truth. All works of art created by truthful minds without regard for the work's conventional exterior remain genuine for all times.","Serious art has been the work of individual artists whose art has had nothing to do with style because they were not in the least connected with the style or the needs of the masses. Their work arose rather in defiance of their times.","Religions die slowly."],"Franz Schubert":["Happy is the man who finds a true friend, and far happier is he who finds that true friend in his wife.","Nobody understands another's sorrow, and nobody another's joy.","When I wished to sing of love, it turned to sorrow. And when I wished to sing of sorrow, it was transformed for me into love.","There are eight girls in the house in which I am living, and practically all of them are good looking. You can realize that I am kept busy.","Easy mind, light heart. A mind that is too easy hides a heart that is too heavy.","If only your pure and clean mind could touch me, dear Haydn, nobody has a greater reverence for you than I have.","Approval or blame will follow in the world to come.","Our castle is not imposing, but is well built, and surrounded by a very fine garden. I live in the bailiff's house.","No one feels another's grief, no one understands another's joy. People imagine they can reach one another. In reality they only pass each other by.","The world resembles a stage on which every man is playing a part.","Every night when I go to bed, I hope that I may never wake again, and every morning renews my grief.","You believe happiness to be derived from the place in which once you have been happy, but in truth it is centered in ourselves.","I am composing like a god, as if it simply had to be done as it has been done.","I try to decorate my imagination as much as I can.","The moment is supreme.","Why does God endow us with compassion?","One bites into the brass mouthpiece of his wooden cudgel, and the other blows his cheeks out on a French horn. Do you call that Art?","Why should the composer be more guilty than the poet who warms to fantasy by a strange flame, making an idea that inspires him the subject of his own very different treatment?","The manager is to be blamed who distributes parts to his players which they are unable to act.","A man endures misfortune without complaint.","Above all things, I must not get angry. If I do get angry I knock all the teeth out of the mouth of the poor wretch who has angered me.","I never force myself to be devout except when I feel so inspired, and never compose hymns of prayers unless I feel within me real and true devotion.","The greatest misfortune of the wise man and the greatest unhappiness of the fool are based upon convention.","There are two contrary impulses which govern this man's brain-the one sane, and the other eccentric. They alternate at regular intervals."],"Franz Werfel":["Religion is the everlasting dialogue between humanity and God. Art is its soliloquy.","Yes, death is strong, but look you, the strongest, Stronger is music than death."],"Franz Wright":["I am in no way different from anyone else, that my predicament, my sense of aloneness or isolation may be precisely what unites me with everyone.","I wish my father could be around.","There are people who recall my father as a saint and a monster. I'm quite sure I will share the same fate.","When I'm in certain moods, a conversation will start up in my head, and suddenly I'll realize that the language has reached a very high and interesting level, and then lines and stanzas will just kind of appear, full-blown.","It's hard for me to grasp that I might somehow be my father's equal in any way.","Poetry endures when it possesses passionate and primally sincere clarity in the service of articulating universal human concerns.","What I myself experience is indescribable gratitude in the face of God's perpetual and preemptive love, a love which is not contingent upon requital or even belief in His existence.","I write and have done so primarily for personal pleasure.","Poetry, just because it is poetry, doesn't mean it is some kind of magic spell.","For about twenty years, if I managed to write ten or twelve poems in a year; I considered that a pretty successful year, but I wrote 'The Beforelife' within a year.","When I was nine, I started reading Homer. I would get up at four o'clock in the morning, before I had to go to school, in third or fourth grade, and, for several hours, I would read 'The Iliad' or 'The Odyssey.'","I've always envied people who compose music or paint, because they don't have to be bothered with the sort of crude mess that language normally is, in everyday life and in the way we use it.","We know there are poets who are chosen: by what or whom, we no more know than what lies beyond our final breath, or what caused a certain action which resulted in the fulfillment or the desecration and collapse of what we most cared for in life.","The poetic prose that most interests me is that of Henri Michaux.","Beckett's 'Stories and Texts for Nothing' is probably my favorite book.","I used to comfort myself with the idea of a book with serrated, detachable pages, so that you could read the thing the way it came and then shuffle the pages, like a giant deck of cards, and read the book in an entirely different order. It would be a different book, wouldn't it? It would be one of infinite books."],"Franz von Holzhausen":["Tesla is changing the paradigm. We're going to turn the world on its ear and create high demand through design.","Why shouldn't a car key look like a car?","The thing I love about electric vehicles is not stopping in gas stations. We're so accustomed to that... Now I'm in control of when I refuel.","There is a new hunger in the air for automotive design and looking to where automobiles are going in the future. Tesla will capture this through good design and engineering.","I don't understand how I can pay $299 for iPhone and then get in my car and still have to turn knobs.","We still see that people don't really realize that electric cars are here right now. And when we show up with an actual vehicle, and you see it drive away under its own power, it's still kind of a jaw-dropping moment for a lot of people.","We have an opportunity with the Model S to refine the design language, the surfacing, and all aspects of functionality.","Model S has, really, the ready-to-wear elements. Gen 3 has the opportunity to be more couture.","Historically, there has been a gap between single-purpose racecars and street-legal models - commonly called supercars - that emulate the real racers on the road.","People want to feel good about the choices they make. They want to know they're choosing material that's not going to harm the environment.","We seem to want one vehicle to carry people and soccer balls and hay bales.","Why is it we want one car to do everything?","Sports cars from the '50s and '60s are my favorites.","My sister has kids, including two in baby seats, and she drives a minivan. I had to climb over the car seats to get into the back seat, and it seemed ridiculous to have to do gymnastics to get in and out of the car.","Women don't want an overly feminine vehicle - they want to feel secure.","My mom marched into the reservation tent and reserved a Model X for herself. She drives a Jeep; she has four grandchildren. She didn't ask my dad. She just went ahead and did it.","We're looking for the early adopter who considers style to be an important part of the purchase decision. But they'll be getting a practical car with plenty of trunk space they can use for picking up building supplies at Home Depot."],"Franz von Papen":["It is to be hoped that the leaders of this movement will place the nation above the party.","We decline the claim to power by parties which want to own their followers body and soul, and which want to put themselves over and above the whole nation.","The nation demands a movement which has written upon its banner the internal and external national freedom that it will act as if it were the spiritual, social and political conscience of the nation.","The essence of conservative ideology is its being anchored in the divine order of things.","Party domination and State leadership are concepts incompatible with one another.","Names and individuals are unimportant when Germany's final fate is at stake.","It is conceivable that a party might gain the majority in parliament and claims the government for itself."],"Frazer Hines":["Never having children is a huge regret of mine.","I would've loved to have children and I'm really good with kids, but I just didn't want to commit to anything when I had cancer.

They're afraid God might recognize them and ask for autographs.","The first time I sang in the church choir; two hundred people changed their religion.","The last time I saw him he was walking down lover's lane holding his own hand.","Washington is no place for a good actor. The competition from bad actors is too great.","Committee - a group of men who individually can do nothing but as a group decide that nothing can be done.","It is probably not love that makes the world go around, but rather those mutually supportive alliances through which partners recognize their dependence on each other for the achievement of shared and private goals.","I don't have to look up my family tree, because I know that I'm the sap.","California is a great place to live if you're an orange.","My father never raised his hand to any one of his children, except in self-defense.","Most of us spend the first six days of each week sowing wild oats; then we go to church on Sunday and pray for a crop failure.","My uncle is a Southern planter.

I think it would be great.","I am opposed to vacations and leisure. I try to make every day a work day. Even if there's nothing on my schedule, I will try do at least one task that is work-related.","I wanted so badly to be in a famous band, and it was not happening. I played drums with different bands and with the Blue Man Group in Chicago, but I definitely felt like, 'Wow, I did not picture my life being like this.'","Fereydun, that's my dad's name. My grandmother, my dad's mom, when she was pregnant, she was dating a man from Persia, a Persian gentleman. It wasn't his child, but he was still very supportive and said, 'Hey, this is a great name,' and so it stuck. So that's what she named him.","Missing something doesn't help anything. You can only look at the future, what you can keep doing.","You should approach everything in life like, 'What is this?'","I'll just say that there are times when TV shows, like 'The Honeymooners' or 'I Love Lucy' or something, where they're totally in their stride, and this thing happens, where you can tell they got everything they wanted. And it starts to look a little relaxed. No criticism to the shows whatsoever; these people are geniuses.","Everywhere I go, somebody says something to me. It's really nice.","I have the capability to have a close relationship with someone.","I learned at 'SNL' that it's a bummer to bum people out.","Surround yourself with people you like and respect; surround yourself with people you just want to be around and keep making things.","I feel bad for everyone I've gone out with.","I came away from 'Saturday Night Live' feeling very well represented. I felt, and I still feel like, they let me do so much stuff that I wanted to do. Stuff that I almost didn't even know what it was.","I think I was a terrible husband, I think I'm a terrible boyfriend.","I want it all... fast. I want to be married, I want to live together... and then somewhere around a year or two years, I get freaked out. I freak out emotionally and then I actually feel like 'Oh my God, who's this stranger in my house?'","I love 'Saturday Night Live,' and I really feel like people who have left before me have always stayed with the show. They never really quite left, which is nice. Everyone kind of stays close.","I spent a lot of time lifting my drums into a van, playing to ten people night after night. I can't complain about anything now. That stuff was heavy.","The day of parts of the country hating each other, or rivalries like that... I feel like that's dead.","I'm so glad cities have personalities, just like people have personalities. That's something that makes me smile.","I'm drawn to punk. I'm drawn to samba a bit. I don't think there's a type of music I'm not drawn to. Lykke Li I really like. Holy Sons I still can't get enough of.","I can't relax. I'm not happy unless I'm working on stuff. 'SNL' is always a huge workload, as enjoyable as it is.","Bill Hader does a really good impression of me.","There's something really easy and just somehow un-crowded about the Portland airport. Every time I go there I'm like, 'Why is this so easy and sweet?'","At 'SNL' there's framed pictures of all the cast members, and it starts with Dan Aykroyd. It's linear. It just keeps going through all these people, and then you're at the end of it.","Chalkboards being used inside the restaurant seem to be a good sign that the proprietors are proud of their food, and that's kind of nice, actually - it's a nice personal touch.","Prince is my favorite ever. I've liked Prince since... It's been a really long time. Even in junior high. I used to only like punk for a while, and I had all these rules for what kinds of groups were cool, and who was not cool, but as soon as I saw this one Prince video... It just broke all those rules. I was like, 'I love this no matter what.'","I've met Tony Danza. He was really nice. And he looks... I feel like he hasn't aged. He looks exactly the same. He's just Tony Danza. He's exactly the same as he's always been.","When people say that L.A. doesn't have a culture, I think it really does: a very old culture, and very specific. There's streets named after entertainers, and statues of entertainers, and it's great. Entertainment is still art, even if it makes billions of dollars. So it's like a city built on entertainment, and art in a way.","I loooved Sleater-Kinney like a crazy person.","I try to maintain a high level of coolness. Which means I've gotta look at lot of magazines. I've gotta look at a lot of ads to see what people want to wear.","I have an inability to relax. I try to make every day a work day. I get pleasure from work... I try to think of sketch ideas, stand-up pieces. I am incapable of leisure and leisure time.","I don't think there's an archetype for the Justin Bieber fan. A Bieber fan just looks like an American. You wouldn't even need a costume to try and resemble one.","I've always been a fan of instructional videos. The bass-player ones are insane. The music on them is fascinating. It's not something you hear on CDs or would really ever play in bands. You listen to it and are like, 'What is happening?' It's this blizzard of notes in weird time signatures, and they're trying to teach you that.","Every music journalist I've ever met has been stunningly beautiful.","There are bands that I am friends with, who will invite me up on stage. Like Les Savy Fav, who have had me on stage, and I have played on their record. There are a couple of bands like that. Yo La Tengo has invited me to play with them.","There are people who are genetically made to start record labels, and I'm not one of those people. People just have it in their blood and are good at it. Corey Rusk from Touch and Go and Ian MacKaye. These are people who have made their own labels.","I tend to think that there is a sophistication to everything at 'Saturday Night Live,' including the sketches.","I'm obsessed with my 20s. I buy things that I wanted in my 20s. It's weird; it's a weird thing that I didn't grow out of.","Sometimes 'Portlandia' can be pretty traditional. But the stuff I've always loved on 'SNL' has always been the weirdest stuff I've done. The stuff that went on at 10 to 1 in the morning.","My favorite song is 'Cybele's Reverie' by Stereolab.","I am immediately disinterested when I hear mountain-climbing stories.","My favorite album is 'Ram' by Paul and Linda McCartney.","When you're in a band, you spend most of your time in a van. Like, there were four of us, we toured all the time, and you're stuck looking at three other people for a month straight. And all of those times, we all just liked making fun of people, doing impressions of people, coming up with songs.","I can't be bothered with narrative. It takes too long for me to try to think of it.","I travel a lot. I'll go back and forth, you know, West Coast-East Coast, but it's separated by segments. So it's not a daily thing.","I actually, legitimately feel that I'm not busy enough. I want to be so busy that it's overwhelming.","I have a problem with sweets. I have an inability to eat a just little bit. It's almost like I can't even enjoy chocolate anymore - I have to stuff it into my brain, cram it into my ears.","That's one of the great things about Los Angeles, that people just play music, and it's all very welcoming and welcomed.","Panned or not, 'Dune' is a real part of science-fiction filmmaking.","I don't know anything about the wine world at all.","I love painters because I don't paint, so I get to enjoy art; I like collecting paintings.","I spent most of my 20s playing music. I was in a band, and we worked really hard and did not get very far.","I was really close to being this guy who used to be in this band who is still playing and trying to get some recordings together, but I got really lucky.","There's no judgment on bands that continue on who aren't popular; some people get enjoyment out of it. I'm just not one of those people.","I would see people on TV, or I'd see bands I really liked, and I thought, 'I want that.'","I feel like Miami is way, way too hot.","I love driving. Listen to some music.","I find it weird to use my own voice on TV.","I think Ian MacKaye is everything that I always wanted to be.","I will always, no matter what, be a punk more than anything.","Over the years, El Perro del Mar became this artist that, every record that came out, I just loved it.","El Perro del Mar sort of accompanied my time at 'SNL.' To concentrate and focus, I would play the bass to one of her songs from her third album.","When 'Pale Fire' came out, that album was a big friend of mine. I've just always purely been a fan of El Perro del Mar.","I'd want to direct a video for Yoko Ono. As long as I got to work with Yoko Ono someday, I'd be really happy. I just think she's such a great artist - it would just be so nice.","As far as value goes, obviously it's nicer to be in an environment where you feel comfortable. But it's also clear that it's probably not the most realistic thing.","I would never play a character that wasn't true. It's not a moral thing; it's just that it's more convincing if it's a little bit like me.","I'm not by nature a cynical person. But sometimes your expectations are different from reality.","I was actually late to the punk movement because I was too young.","The bands that were big in '77, like the Clash and the Sex Pistols and Talking Heads, I got into them in the early '80s. And it changed my life. It got into my DNA.","I will always consider myself a punk because of those experiences in high school. It will always be a part of me.","The way James Franco goes to new projects, he does it the way an artist should, which is with a question mark. Like, will this work?","Wayne Coyne has put out Flaming Lips records in gummy bear skulls and all these different kinds of packaging that's really, really inventive. And that's what you should always do.","There's almost no such thing as a hipster.","I was impersonating people way, way, way early, as far back as I can remember. And I would do people on my street for my parents, I remember. And in school, I did the same thing with all the teachers. It was just like, I mean, it was something I loved to do. I don't think there was a time when I wasn't doing it. I was always doing it.","When I used to see Rick Moranis do something, to me that was immediately funny. Or George Carlin or Martin Lawrence.","I really loved touring with my band, but it felt like we would spend a lot of time playing in empty rooms - empty clubs. We had some good successes, but it's so physically hard to load up a van and drive all day.","I really like watching TV at home.","If something seems like a little venue, don't treat it like that. Do it all. If you're sort of wondering why you're doing something at some location, just do it - any size theater, production, or whatever. It's all helpful.","I believe in limitations. I think the worst art ever made - in my opinion, because it's all so subjective - is where the artist had complete freedom.","I take any project on a month or two at a time. Meaning, I don't think too far ahead.","I think a comedian has a more specific job. Whereas a musician can fall into different categories, you know, of making background music or doing a soundtrack or wanting to be in a band or writing the song, or writing your own songs. And then comedy is a very black and white thing. You want to make people happy.","People on the street comment on how handsome I am. You know, people stop and say how angular my face is.","No yoga. I can barely sit down.","We almost called the 'Portlandia' show 'Stumptown.' That was the original name.","Art should not be an easy thing.","The worst art is when it's really convenient and comfy.","Discomfort is the way to go if you want to make something you feel is worthwhile.","My showbiz career started with 'SNL,' and to write an 'SNL' book... well, there are already enough of those.","I get very, very little sleep.","I feel really lucky to get to do comedy, and music, at all. I want to do as much as I can.","My problem is with intimacy. That's where I have my biggest problems.","For some reason, juggling things makes everything work better. That's just how we operate. It just makes the other project more of something to look forward to. I think the more you keep things going, the more it helps the other project.","I love my bandmates, and they're my friends, and even though we had fun and got to tour and I got to play the drums a lot, which I'll always appreciate, we had a really rough time. We toured and tried to get people to come to our shows and put out records, and we really struggled.","For me, I would get so frustrated because I would see these other bands just whip by us.","Sometimes in Portland I'm like, 'Who is funding this city?' It's doing great - there's all these new shops; there's a synthesizer store. Where is this coming from?","I like that 'Broad City' exists, and I love being around at the same time as 'Key & Peele.' I love those guys - I just, I love their faces.","One person who was interesting was Jello Biafra, who was - of all things - very professional!","As a kid, 'The Monkees' was such a cool show. I had such a thrill saying, 'OMG, I was in a sketch with one of the Monkees.'","My mom is from Venezuela, and my dad is German and Japanese, and we lived in Brazil when I was a kid for a couple of years, and then I grew up on Long Island. I think all the traveling and all the nationalities put that stuff in my head. I was just around it a lot.","Ever since I was really little, I started doing a - I don't know how to put this - mentally challenged person on my street. I meant no harm by it, but I remembered how this person talked, and I did it for my mom, and she was not into it. She said, 'You can't do that!' But my dad really laughed.","The Long Island experience is so strange. You're a satellite around the city, so the presence of the city is always looming.","I really like Au Revoir Simone.","Hopefully there will be a day when all comedy is all robots.","There should be comedians who perform only for robots - I'm saying human comedians that only perform for robots.","I can only parody stuff I love.","Music documentaries are tricky because of 'Spinal Tap.' That movie has stood the test of time.","Talking Heads were a big influence on my comedy. For David Byrne, every album had to be different. With 'Portlandia,' every season has to be different. You gotta reinvent the look, all of it.","Before 'SNL,' I would do stand-up, opening for Jeff Tweedy. It was worse than bombing in that people were dead silent.","I don't think I've ever hosted anything in my life.","When I'm hungry, I need to eat right away.","All of my memories are now on hard drives. I'll change phones or I'll change my laptop, and all my photos stay.","Since I was, like, an infant... I remember being in love with television. I loved listening to music. I wanted to be on records, and I wanted to be on TV.","I see everything as a positive that can only help me.","When you're being mean to someone, you can feel the audience just get cold.","You have to understand how lucky I feel. I was on 'Saturday. Night. Live.' I played with the Clash! On what planet would I look at anything in my life in any less-than-stellar way?","I work better when I'm juggling projects. Nothing worse than watching someone really embrace what they're doing if they love it too much.","I will admit that I purposely stress myself out. But I think I like stressing myself out. There's a glamour to, like, 'I've got to get to the airport!' I just like the caricature.","I don't like watching shows where all of a sudden you're like, what happened? They shot the last season in Las Vegas?","I started comedy in, like, 1998.","'Sandinista!' is a masterpiece.","When punk came along, it made perfect sense to me. I found it melodic. The Clash, Buzzcocks.","James Franco has turned his life into a real art project. In my opinion, that's the way to live.","Questlove redefined what a band can be, and Paul Shaffer and Max Weinberg really put their own spin on it. I bow down to these people. All of them.","I like to think Portland and L.A. are not rivals; they're cousins. As cities on the West Coast, they're distinct in their own way but still culturally similar."],"Fred Astaire":["The hardest job kids face today is learning good manners without seeing any.","This search for what you want is like tracking something that doesn't want to be tracked. It takes time to get a dance right, to create something memorable.","Disco is just jitterbug.","The higher up you go, the more mistakes you are allowed. Right at the top, if you make enough of them, it's considered to be your style.","Dancing is a sweat job.","I have no desire to prove anything by dancing. I have never used it as an outlet or a means of expressing myself. I just dance. I just put my feet in the air and move them around.","I don't want to be the oldest performer in captivity... I don't want to look like a little old man dancing out there.","I just put my feet in the air and move them around."],"Fred Barnes":["Presidents with strong nerves are decisive. They don't balk at unpopular decisions. They are willing to make people angry. Bush had strong nerves. Clinton, who passed up a chance to eliminate Osama bin Laden, did not. Obama is a people pleaser, a trait not normally associated with nerves of steel.","Obama sounded like Al Gore on global warming. The more the case for man-made warming falls apart, the more hysterical Gore gets about an imminent catastrophe. The more public support his stimulus bill loses, the more Obama embraces fear-mongering.","The mainstream media may have trouble resisting the temptation to declare that Karl Rove has been demoted, but the truth is quite the contrary. By giving up his role as deputy White House chief of staff, Rove has been freed to do what he does best: shape big issues and develop strategies to win elections.","President Obama insists he's a free-market guy. But you have to wonder whether he understands how a free economy really works.","Candidates don't have to deal with reality. They talk about the wonderful things they can accomplish as if advocating them is the same as achieving them. They live in a world of political make-believe in which everything from reconciling conflicting interests to paying for costly programs is easy.","Obama specializes in knocking down straw men. 'I reject the view that says our problems will simply take care of themselves,' he said, implying that's the view of Republicans. It's the view of almost no one."],"Fred Brooks":["The fundamental problem with program maintenance is that fixing a defect has a substantial chance of introducing another.","Good judgment comes from experience and experience comes from bad judgment.","There is no single development, in either technology or management technique, which by itself promises even one order-of-magnitude improvement within a decade in productivity, in reliability, in simplicity.","Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.","How does a project get to be a year behind schedule? One day at a time.","Systematically identity top designers as early as possible. The best are often not the most experienced.","How does a project get to be a year late? One day at a time."],"Fred Couples":["I can say I won a Senior British Open at Turnberry. I think that's the best thing about it, the whole week, was playing this course. It's a challenging, very tough course, under extreme weather. But you know, it's nice to win any event.","Golf is a game to me. Other players work extremely hard all year long. I work hard before Augusta. I know I get good results when I practice, but it also wears me out. It literally wore me out even when I was in my 20s.","I will say I love competing, and I was in a great era of playing with young Phil Mickelson and older Greg Norman and Nick Price. I don't know if YA Title could throw the ball these days, but you can play golf for a long, long time.","I'm a lot older than I was when I was 30, which is kind of hard to believe.","I'm not very good in the rain. I don't wear a golf glove.","I could go away five or six weeks in a row and never touch a club. I would just look at them and say, 'I just don't want to; it's not that important.' And it wasn't that important. Golf - I don't want to answer loosely - I pay a lot of attention to it, but I don't ever really think about it.","My mom was so people-friendly. She was incredible. She'd go to the mall, and she'd talk to everyone. Give people a kiss on the cheek. I think if I wasn't pushed around a lot, I'd be great with people. Maybe I still can be.","My goal has always been to play golf, and play it well. In the end, that's what I am, a golfer. If my back lets me, I'm going to play my favorite places. If I hurt myself, that'll probably be it for a while.","I think people like players they can relate to. It seems as if people think they know me. I just think I'm an ordinary Joe who plays golf very, very well.","I caddied for a guy who was a very good player, and he gave me a set of clubs, just a starter set: 5-iron, 7-iron, 9-iron, putter and driver. I just loved it. How I developed my swing was to just grab a club and start banging balls.","Golf is supposed to be fun, but I don't think anything is fun if you're not doing it reasonably well.","I left home at 17, traveled. I got married when I was 21. That's a young age. As it turned out, things were fine, then not so fine, and then it was a blunder. That happens all the time.","Really in all my years on Tour, in the U.S. Open I probably played great golf in two of them, out of maybe 20, so it's a lot of work.","I used to break a lot of clubs. I probably was a little different than your average junior player. I did have a lot longer hair and a lot more brown hair. But my demeanor, you know, really from maybe my second, third year on Tour, has gotten a lot more even keel.","I'm pretty much a self-taught player. My swing hasn't changed a whole lot, I don't think. But I watch a lot of people."],"Fred Davis":["Whenever I design any variant, or when anybody sends me one, I always say if at all possible within the context of the game don't have two home supply centers touching each other.","I think most people played both variants and regular games. It was a period when variants were very popular and there were a lot more variants being played at that time. Every week practically, it seemed someone would publish a new variant in a zine.","Then, all of a sudden, he stopped and nobody heard from him or got a response to orders. At this point Rod Walker looked him up and found he was living in a commune and seemed to be dropping out of the hobby."],"Fred DeLuca":["If I'm spending time on something, I may as well do good as opposed to average.","If you treat people nicely, and you allow them to fulfill a role that is satisfying for them, they'll accomplish a lot, and they'll enjoy their work.","Profit or perish... There are only two ways to make money: increase sales and decrease costs.","You could have everything right but be in the wrong place. You think your business is no good, but really, the problem is your place is no good.","You start a business, and you really don't have much of a budget.","You really have to understand this isn't a business where you sit in the back room and do calculations - you have to be very concerned about employees and customers, because that's really what's going to bring you success.","We give great value for our franchisees: They can build a store for well under $200,000. And we have extremely simple operating systems. The preparation is mostly done in front of the customer. That simplicity is really what attracts our Subway franchise. You see it, and you can do it.","In a typical situation, it's going to take pretty close to a year to get your location in, get your permits, and then get open.","There are so many ingredients that are approved for use. You can't be an expert on all of them.","When I started in the business, the minimum wage was $1.25. I've seen an enormous number of wage increases. Basically, it applies evenly to everyone in the business.","The people who come to work deserve to be paid properly, and there's no excuse. I could understand someone making a small error, but sometimes people make systematic errors, and that's not right.","It's tough for people to get into business, especially a small business.","The payroll tax is affecting sales. It's causing sales declines.","If I were in charge of the government, I would index the minimum wage to inflation, so that way, everybody knows what they can count on.","Everybody who goes through the business will make mistakes. The big question is how big will the mistakes be? How fast will they learn from the mistakes, and how quickly will they get the business in the correct direction?","Six months after we started, in 1964, there was a day when we sold only seven sandwiches. If we'd taken all the money from the register, we couldn't have paid an employee, much less the food or the rent or all that. It could have been a turning point. We could have given up.","There's huge access to information. If you need to learn something, you can go on the Internet and learn very quickly. You can reach across miles and miles to find companies that can assist you.","I watch 'Shark Tank,' of course. It's very entertaining. I think it's actually good to help people think about the business they might start, and sometimes you get encouraged by looking at someone going into business and saying, 'Hey, I could do that.'","Subway is a real point of pride. We have influenced the way people eat.","If someone wants to eat healthy, they can do that and get the sandwich exactly right. I'm so pleased we're able to influence so many people and their eating habits.","I don't have much of a bucket list. I don't have a lot of needs and desires.","I guess that's one of the benefits of being sick. Your wife lets you have a big-screen TV in the living room.","You have to be able to communicate the vision to the people in your organization so that they know where and how they should direct themselves on a day-to-day basis.","Every time I come across learning items of interest, I'll send distribution voice mail to the appropriate group in the organization.","Higher unemployment generally bodes well for franchising. People are looking for a new opportunity, and people who have jobs are a little less confident they'll always have a job.","We have always had many more franchisee candidates than available locations.","In some markets, we don't have a lot of room to expand. We've done studies of store density and essentially found our more dense markets have more than one store per 15,000 people.","The United States is a huge market, and once you get rolling, you can replicate that model over and over pretty easily. Your supply lines are taken care of. You don't have technicians to deal with. You've got your customer base.","When we first started the company, I didn't have any thoughts of franchising. We just had company-owned stores.","When you're invested in your own business, you're going to run it better. When people are financially responsible for whether their store succeeds, they're going to have that kind of entrepreneurial spirit that's harder to get if headquarters is running things.","If you have company-owned stores, you make 100 percent of the profit from each one, but you have less entrepreneurial spirit.","There may be a perception that, with franchises, they're all the same, so that limits the ability to experiment. But that's not true. We've always kept two slots open on the menu of each Subway franchise - slots that franchisees can use to come up with their own sandwich ideas.","We find that no matter what country we're in, if we hit the right economic notes and appeal to the mass market, we're able to build the business very, very rapidly.","Everybody eats three times a day; it's only a question of where they choose to eat. The longer-term trends are people eat out more often.","In the U.S. and Canada, we have one store for every 12,000 people.","In 1974, we began franchising. We didn't have any big thought process except that, 'OK, franchising will help us get to our goal of 32 stores and help us run stores farther away from home.'","Because the stores worked, franchisees wanted to build more stores. If your model works, folks who are happy with it will buy out the ones who aren't happy.","A lot of stuff happens daily when you're running a company like Subway. If you get too happy about some things or too unhappy about others, you get worn out. It's best if you can pace yourself a little bit more.","I tell everybody there are only three things that we do. We build sales at the store level, we build profits at the store level, and we build more stores. The first two things go in tandem, of course. It's pretty tough to build profits without sales.","After 39 years of business, I'm still learning. I go through this every year -identifying new strategies that are extremely important.","From my point of view, my job is just to work hard for our franchisees, so they can maintain the position they're in, and to grow market share.","From my point of view, what I really like, what I think is really terrific about my work, is that the company's had the opportunity to train literally thousands and thousands of brand new franchisees to successfully run their very first business.","A couple times a year, I get in the car, and I'll drive 1,000 miles cross-country, going through side streets. I'll stay off the highways as much as possible. And I realize it's a huge country, and for us to be in so many places in the country is an amazing thing.","The franchisees are uniquely in touch at the local level. They see what's going on in their communities in a way we couldn't ever imagine.","We're very much in the people business in that there are two important groups you have to work with: customers and employees.","To a large extent, we're working hard to fulfill the consumer demand for Subway sandwiches.","I don't have any interest in cashing out or leaving the business or doing something else. I just love Subway, and I want to keep focusing on the company for the benefit of all our franchise owners. So I'm kind of like married to the job.","I know a lot of people at some point in their business careers decide they'll just cash in and do something else, but for some reason, I've never had that feeling.","Back when we started, people didn't even know what a submarine sandwich was. The product was only sold in a few markets.","I made the first sandwich before entering college.","Most of the people we sign on as development agents commit to goals they don't believe are possible.","I went to school because I was supposed to. I did pre-med because my mum thought it was a good idea.","For a franchise system to work well, you really need people with an entrepreneurial mind-set because, while you have a large, overarching system that everybody has to work with, a lot of local issues have to be handled.","You have to realize that the customer really is king. People who go into more established businesses probably have to be careful not to be casual about that. When you have a brand-new business, and nobody knows who you are, you know you have to work really hard for your customers.","Even if you set a long-term goal, that doesn't mean it's a straight-line journey. Often, there are problems and obstacles along the way.","How you handle the obstacles has a big impact on how you do. If you give up, then you obviously don't get there, but if you're persistent, and you keep thinking of new ways to approach the business, you're more likely to reach your goal.","By and large, we're a bread-eating culture. People like sandwiches. We don't really over-think that one.","Back in the early days of international, everybody wanted to customize the menu for every place.","I was 17 years old when I built the first store... A very simple, basic store with a basic counter - not very much equipment, all purchased second-hand. And the menu was very simple.","We have salads, some other beverages. But in reality, it's still fundamentally the same business. The most likely thing the next person will buy is a sandwich and a soft drink. After a half-century of glacial change, we're still pretty much the same business.","I don't think I ever dreamt of going into business. No one in my family was in business.","I was able to solve enough big problems along the way that the sheriff didn't come along and put the 'bankruptcy' sign up."],"Fred Durst":["My life. The life I'm living that's where all my inspiration comes from. Real life experiences.","Sometimes it's about less is more. It's about the seed. Thinking about this gigantic tree that you think is so beautiful but it started with this just seed.","I was a kid who got picked on in school, and now the guys beating up those kids were wearing red caps and using my music to fuel that aggression. But if they listen to the lyrics, the aggression is targeted at them.","I'm an actor's director.","That's your best friend and your worst enemy - your own brain.","To walk around with an ego is a bad thing. To have confidence in yourself is a great thing.","When you reminisce aren't the times that someone's forcing you to reminisce. You reminisce other times in your life.","I usually find several ways to express myself: different moods, different days, different voices, different things, 'I'm lighthearted today, I'm gonna do this.'","When life was worrying about a car payment or a rent payment and a bill, you're so consumed with that, you really don't have time to know yourself. That's surviving and getting by.","Everybody loves the underdog, and then they take an underdog and make him a hero and they hate him. But as long as they can knock you back down, it seems like if you're an underdog again, and things do surface, and they think this is real, 'these guys' intentions are genuine and sincere,' it seems like they will embrace you again.","I love electronic music, and I love drum and bass.","I love it when talented actors can bring characters to life. Anybody who wears their feelings on their sleeve and has a harder, crusty shell - like I do - is definitely protecting an inner sensitivity.","I want to clear my mind a little bit and give my mind a little bit of time to breathe so I can pinpoint or at least nail down feelings I'm having and that I've had for the last however long. I need to nail them down long enough to actually write about and elaborate on them.","If you wanna know how not secure you are, just take a look around. Nothing's secure. Nothing's safe. I don't hate technology, I don't hate hackers, because that's just what comes with it, without those hackers we wouldn't solve the problems we need to solve, especially security.","You know, in my music career there was a moment where the irony was just so heavy. There were people in my audience that were the reason I developed neuroses. These people that tortured my life were using my art, my poetry, as fuel for them, to torture other people.","I'm in touch with the social networks and stuff.","I've been around golf my whole life. My father did it all the time, and I resented him for it. But a couple years ago I picked up a golf club and I understood the physics of it. If anyone knows anything about golf, it's that once you hit a few shots, you'll become addicted.","There's an insecure part of me that comes out of me, I get nervous. I don't know why, I wish I could overcome it because it gives me an anxiety feeling.","Being in front of all these people staring at you and it helps you to dig down and become more emotional and get lost in it as you're feeding on people's energy.","I think they'd rather us follow our hearts and I hope that's what some people will understand.","One of the things that was confusing about Limp Bizkit to some people is that our tastes were very different.","I'm a sensitive guy; I respond to things that make my eyes well up a little bit, or make me root for people. I find the human condition interesting.","When Wes came back to Limp Bizkit, we really wanted to do something different. We wanted to make a core record that we didn't care who liked or who disliked.","I love finding EPs for bands that you just discover.","There's some people who are not understanding what Limp Bizkit is about. But, then again, who am I to tell people what they can use art for or how they can interpret it?","I wouldn't support Limp Bizkit being on some snuff backyard brawling, fighting contest.","I love jazz music and sad music. I'm a sentimental guy. I'm a romantic guy.","I'm 38 years old and Limp Bizkit is just something I do. If I was a painter, it would just be a type of painting I make.","I'm definitely on the incline to a peak.","Our music has always been instant reactive and I guess taking our time to absorb things and say what you really want to say could be much more offensive than anything we've ever done.","And touring is difficult when everybody's heads aren't in the same place.","As much as I want to go out and tour every single day and I'm ready to rip it right now, there's five people in the band, there's five people who've evolved and grown and there's five people who have to get on the same page and want the same things, and it takes a lot to tour.","Emotionally, I was affected a lot by Rage Against the Machine, not specifically the literal intention of the words or what it was about, but the feel, the sound, those phrases that got me.","I'm the same guy at that podium preaching to the people on every single song. I'm not doing a dance for you on another song. It's all a direct assault.","Prague is a dark place.","I don't hate technology, I don't hate hackers, because that's just what comes with it, without those hackers we wouldn't solve the problems we need to solve, especially security.","When you say something is very different to a core base that expects heavy music from you or very aggressive music, everybody tends to go, 'Oh, they're gonna get mellow, they're gonna get soft.'","I'm always looking for new talent.","I loved the Cure and Bauhaus and the Smiths. The people in my town weren't privy to that kind of music and I got abused. I discovered the microphone to get out some of that angst.","I'm a sentimental guy.","I'm a romantic guy.","There's definitely an obstacle in developing a brand for yourself that people can rely on when you're so eclectic.","I'm an actor's director. I love it when talented actors can bring characters to life.","Anybody who wears their feelings on their sleeve and has a harder, crusty shell - like I do - is definitely protecting an inner sensitivity.","Sometimes I feel like I used to be a person that liked to express himself a lot and put my feelings out there.","My Web site, everything I write in there is from me.","I've always wanted to make movies.","When you're a kid, you see your parents reading the newspaper and you're like, 'God, why are they reading the newspaper?' When you're young, you're not reading the newspaper. But there comes a time in your life when the newspaper's cool.","I was a kid who got picked on in school and got beat up by popular, athletic soccer-type people.","I think ever since I was preteen I wanted to direct movies and tell stories.","For someone in my position, there's opportunities to be anything you want to be, even if you shouldn't be eligible, and I think that's left a bad taste in a lots of financers' and studios' mouths. Just cause someone's popular at one thing, letting them do the other isn't always the right thing.","When I go to shows, I'm really looking forward to hearing the songs I know. I don't like it when a band tries to expose me to new stuff.","When I look back on my knee-jerk reactions now, I realize I should have just taken a breath.","I'm OCD beyond comparison.","I don't think my name would necessarily draw people to come see the movie. It might hurt the movie, honestly.","I didn't want to do a throwaway, mindless movie with fart jokes just to make 6-year-olds laugh. I want to provide my children with some substance.","It's amazing how, over time, a person's perspective can be altered.","I am not a hater.","I don't fight people for fun.","I won't deny a song or a melody. I can't deny it.","Sometimes you feel like it's cursed when something takes so long to come out and you don't know if it's going to really come out.","Directing a movie is serious, it's not a joke.","Directing a film is a lot of work.","I want to make timeless movies.","I'm a real director.","People evolve and grow, and life is fascinating and fun and tragic.","I stopped predicting the future a long time ago.","I'm obsessed by film. I'm obsessed with music and producing and making things happen.","I'm my own salesman. I can't let anybody do anything for me.","I made a lot mistakes that I'm grateful for, because I won't make them again and I won't let my artists make them, or I'll tell them, 'Don't do this.' A lot of them still make them anyway, but you can't be told things when you're doing your own thing.","It's not about how much movement you do, how much interaction there is, it just reeks of credibility if it's real. If it's contrived, it seems to work for a while for the people who can't filter out the real and unreal.","I have always been Fred Durst and I've always been me.","I do think that some bands seem to be dabbling in the rock-hip-hop world and are not necessarily serious about it.","I love collaborating.","Once you get in a position where your rent is taken care of and you do have a job, you really get to deal with yourself and really become one with yourself. And you wake to your mind every day. That's your best friend and your worst enemy - your own brain."],"Fred Ehrsam":["The ability to easily buy and sell Bitcoin has been a really key factor in accelerating Bitcoin adoption.","Ethereum has taken what was a four-function calculator of a programming language in Bitcoin and turned it into a full-fledged computer.","Everything will be tokenized and connected by a blockchain one day.","Make no mistake - Ethereum would never have existed without Bitcoin as a forerunner. That said, I think Ethereum is ahead of Bitcoin in many ways and represents the bleeding edge of digital currency.","Ethereum will be a first-class citizen on Coinbase.","Blockchains are digital organisms. As organisms evolve through changes in their DNA, blockchain protocols evolve through changes in their code. And like biological organisms, the most adaptive blockchains will be the ones that survive and thrive.","When you drill down, blockchains are really a shared version of reality everyone agrees on. So whether it's a fully immersive VR experience, augmented reality, or even Bitcoin or Ethereum in the physical world as a shared ledger for our 'real world,' we'll increasingly trust blockchains as our basis for reality.","The fundamentals of the token model are valuable and powerful. They allow communities to govern themselves, their economics, and rally a community in powerful ways that will allow open systems to flourish in a way that was previously impossible.","When the Bitcoin white paper emerged in 2008, it was completely revolutionary. The amount of concepts that had to come together in just the right way - computer science, cryptography, and economic incentives - was astonishing.","AIs trained on open data are more likely to be neutral and trustworthy instead of biased by the interests of the corporation who created and trained them.","Scaling is multidimensional. Different methods address different things.","I think it's fundamentally a good sign that more and more professional traders and market makers are providing liquidity to the whole ecosystem. It allows people to move much larger quantities of digital currency more quickly than they would if that were not the case.","At the end of the day, what's going to make bitcoin successful is more people making more interesting things, just like the beginning of the Internet.","OpenAI is doing important work by releasing tools which promote AI to be developed in the open. Compute power is largely produced by NVIDIA and Intel and still relatively expensive but openly purchasable. Blockchains may be the key final ingredient by providing massive pools of open training data.","I'd guess blockchains will be the full-blown backbone of virtual worlds - the system for currency, assets, identity, even governance - before doing the same in the 'real world.' Which is where I think we will end up in the real world eventually; it's just a matter of which goes first and how long until it's the case for both.","Bitcoin is valuable as a currency because of the economic efficiencies the bitcoin network is already creating as transactions flow over it. As with the Internet, more applications will flourish which will make the bitcoin network, and thus bitcoin as a currency, valuable.","People far too often associate derivatives markets with mere speculation, but there are very legitimate businesses that need derivatives to protect themselves against risk.","We are on our way to blockchains as the fabric of society - the system for what we own (assets), who we are (identity), how we make decisions (governance), and more in an increasingly digital world. It's going to be a wild ride.","For the foreseeable future, I'm all about building blockchain-based decentralized services.","AIs are only as good as the data they are trained on. And while many of the tech giants working on AI, like Google and Facebook, have open-sourced some of their algorithms, they hold back most of their data.","To create an open protocol which helps coordinate resources towards a common goal, the resources need to be known at some level in the same way a lot of of data on the web needs to be public for it to be traversable and useful.","Private funding was one of the first methods used when MIT funded Bitcoin core developers Gavin Andresen, Wladimir van der Laan, and Cory Fields in 2015.","Public crowdfunding still suffers from a tragedy of the commons problem. Everyone will want the benefit of the crowdfunded efforts but is incentivized to sit on the sidelines and hope others chip in.","The self-driving car revolution was kicked off by The 'DARPA' Grand Challenge to make an autonomous car traverse 132 mi. of a desert.","Working on a token is similar to working on a startup: higher risk and lower initial impact but higher upside potential. How core protocol work is best funded beyond the initial Ethereum Foundation endowment is an open question, but likely further out.","Not having sub-governance would be like anyone who owns USD being able to walk into a Google shareholder meeting and voting without owning Google stock just because Google shares happen to be denominated in USD.","Ethereum may make monetary policy decisions like, 'Let's do 1% inflation to support the ongoing development of the Ethereum protocol.' A token built on Ethereum might want to do the same.","Tokens align incentives between developers, contributors, users, and investors. They allow everyone who wants to contribute to a project early the opportunity to get in on the ground floor.","Just like mutations to DNA in biological organisms allow for evolution through natural selection, forking lets us run multiple experiments in parallel where the strongest versions survive.","Forks often arise from differences of opinion in the direction of a project. And tokens are increasingly a mechanism for voting on changes to their protocols. Since the point of a fork is to try a new path, the new fork may not want to port all of the prior holders opposed to trying the new path the fork was created to take.","Redistributing tokens is a balancing act. In most cases, forks probably want to keep ownership for users constant so users have at least the same incentives to use the new fork as the historical one.","I think the whole narrative of blockchain without bitcoin will amount to very little.","The Internet had a core innovation that made it valuable: The ability to disseminate data over a distributed network in a way that was significantly cheaper than the prior methods.","Just as the Internet brought the cost of disseminating information down by an order of magnitude, bitcoin brings the cost of transferring ownership down by an order of magnitude.","Bitcoin's value is the same: It will remain as long as it is the most efficient mechanism for transferring ownership.","Sales conducted on-chain through smart contracts couldn't really be done before Ethereum, which is why they are a newer concept. I think this style will become the most common over time.","At GDAX, we want to see new protocols and their tokens flourish.","When the actual Bitcoin network launched in 2009, no one knew about it, and many of those who did thought it would surely fail. Just to make sure the thing worked, the scripting language in Bitcoin was intentionally extremely restrictive.","The scripting language in Bitcoin is important because it is what makes Bitcoin 'programmable money'. Within each Bitcoin transaction is the ability to write a little program.","Bitcoin has a core technological innovation: The ability to publicly verify ownership, instantly transfer that ownership, and do so without the need for a trusted third party.","The Internet will continue to be valuable so long as it is the most efficient mechanism for transferring data. Bitcoin's value is the same: It will remain as long as it is the most efficient mechanism for transferring ownership.","Bitcoin is inherently international, and one of its great promises is it enables cross-border payments in a more efficient way.","While it may seem scarier in the earlier days, I think ultimately the blockchain creates a safer world.","If you are going to store your e-wallet on your own server, don't keep your e-wallet on your desktop, and make sure you use encryption. If you lose your computer, your bitcoins are lost forever.","When Coinbase was starting, we thought we were seeing the birth of something that was really important - what I would almost describe as the future fabric of society - the system for who we are - our identities, what we own, our assets.","There's been a myth perpetuated where people think, 'I need to go into consulting, banking, finance, law, or medicine to make a consistently reasonable amount of money.' People are now realizing that's not the case.","The best engineered organisms can outpace others, even if they start smaller or later.","Working on Ethereum could be similar to working at a Google: lower risk with broad impact right away. Working on a token is similar to working on a startup: higher risk and lower initial impact but higher upside potential.","AIs are only as good as the data they are trained on.","As with early internet startups, some token models don't make sense. For every 1 huge hit, there will be 3 minor successes and 100 failures, so we shouldn't be surprised when some fail.","Developer mindshare is the most important thing to have in digital currency.","There is nothing that Bitcoin can do which Ethereum can't. While Ethereum is less battle-tested, it is moving faster, has better leadership, and has more developer mindshare."],"Fred Eychaner":["I just like my independence and freedom to come and go and not have an entourage.","I'm not a billionaire, and I'm not a mogul.","Living in Chicago as a country boy, basically, and going to college made a very big impact on me.","I don't put my name on stuff.","I'm a retired media executive.","I would go on the record with my respect for Mike Madigan, which will probably upset a lot of friends. He's enormously skillful at what he does. The only speakers of any House who survive are the ones who can keep their majority and keep everyone going largely in the same direction. Mike Madigan is superb at that.","I am not the progressive Koch brother.","I am a basic social activist with small-business experience, and you go where you need to go.","I am not Richard Branson.","Consolidation is so overwhelming. Someone who has one or two stations doesn't have much clout.","The process of coming out was critical to getting where we are today: coming out to our friends, our family, our co-workers, God forbid, to our clients.","Part of our history includes the long struggle to pass the Chicago Human Rights Ordinance."],"Fred F. Fielding":["Morgan, Lewis is a very large firm now, but it was not quite as big then. It was exciting for an associate in those days, because you got good and varied assignments and terrific training.","This drama between Dean and Ehrlichman took place while I was trying to give the contents to the FBI.","One regret I have is that I did not learn more about what was happening very early, so that I could have tried to stop people from engaging in illegal activities.","But look, you did not have to be well versed in politics to know that some stupid things were going on. It is the counsel's job to stop them, and instead the coverup was created.","Dean had just come from seeing his lawyer. That was the first time that I found out that he had consulted a lawyer. He wanted to tell me what he thought was going on, but he was writing it down as if my house was bugged. He acted like everything was bugged.","It was frightening because it was the first time I had gotten a sense of how serious the problem was. It became clear from his notes that he felt the president himself was involved.","I'm still friendly with Dean. He still calls me on the phone from time to time. John Dean was fired and later ended up spending some time in prison for his role in Watergate.","It is hard for people outside the White House to understand the constant daily problems and issues that come up that require the president's attention, but he can not let himself get too personally involved.","The Nixon years were trying. They honed my judgment for everything I did later on. The experience also illustrated for me the importance of training young lawyers properly.","It became evident to me that there was a very serious political element at work. I know that the term impeachment was bandied about. I do not believe, however, that the word was used with the ferocity it was more recently or that it was in the Nixon years.","The last eight years have created a lot of deep-seated hostility. People take political decisions very personally, and today there is a constant, ongoing attack, with one side or the other being maligned.","Soon after I returned to private practice, former Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger called me one day."],"Fred Frith":["It's like learning a language; you can't speak a language fluently until you find out who you are in that language, and that has as much to do with your body as it does with vocabulary and grammar.","Improvised music involves a lot of intuition and I like developing intuition.","You could say that everything the musicians have learned and known over the years, all of their technical resources, are in a dialogue with the things they are discovering every time, as if it was the first time.","We went through this business of me writing out all the parts for these old songs from Gravity and Speechless and we'd been performing that, but we don't do that any more.","We played some gigs in Switzerland a couple of weeks ago and it was the first time I really felt the group was really a band in the sense of something I could write for.","We play melodic music, we play songs, we play all kinds of things and when you improvise you don't just shut out different languages, you use all the languages that you have.","There's an awful lot of resources that can be drawn upon in an improvised music concert.","There are always things to examine. What's great is not feeling that I have to refuse any of them. Maybe no good from a PR perspective, but from the point of view of everyday life, it keeps things interesting.","The totality of a record is usually beyond ones ability to imagine when you start working on it, but the component parts are, usually, fairly clear one way or another.","Some things don't wind up sounding like you'd expect, which is just as well.","One of the things I particularly enjoyed doing was taking raw sound from locations during the film, like the candy machine, and writing pieces of music to go with them, which is totally unnecessary within the context of the film, because they have their own logic.","Not necessarily in one concert, but they're all there to be used if you want to use them.","If you write songs you have an idea how they're going to sound.","I write with a mouse, because it has no psychological associations or memories or habits associated with it.","I think things changed as a result of a certain perception of our politics. When we went through our zealous, self-righteous period it didn't exactly win us any friends.","I think that one of the things that influences me most as a composer is to what extent I can deconstruct and reconstruct the material that I'm working with.","I remember playing football dressed in peculiar costumes with some friends in France and laughing so hard we couldn't even stand up, let alone kick the ball.","I don't know if I'm striving for anything that I can put into words.","As an improviser I'm now pretty comfortable with trios, so I'm thinking of working up to quartets.","And so many of the kinds of labels you get stuck with don't really tell the story; Progressive, Art Rock, Noise Music, Downtown - it ends up being a struggle to stay out of debates that other people are having around you.","Chris Cutler was kind enough to offer his company as an umbrella, so now I can have all my back catalogue under one roof as it were, and it has the same feeling as with Daniel; this is a matter between friends rather than businessmen.","Well, I think music for kids is never anything but experimental is it?"],"Fred Funk":["I'm going to be wearing the Stryker hat because I'm a walking testimonial to the fact that you can get your knee replaced and still play at a really high level and get your life back.","I would agree to some extent that on the Champions Tour that there is a greater premium on putting than the regular tour because of the course setups.","People are going to paying attention to him whether they love him or hate him. So I think Tiger is a huge focus point on a stage that is as little as golf.","We have two tractor-trailer rigs on the Tour. One is a therapy truck, and one is a workout truck. If everything is going well, you're walking in the workout truck, and when things aren't going well, you're walking in the therapy truck.","I don't want to rest on my laurels. I still feel like I'm learning a lot about the golf game and the swing. There are so many different little facets of golf that there is always something to learn.","I still pinch myself that I had the career that I had.","My career progressed slowly. Real slow at a time. The irony of it was I had the best part of my career between when I was 45 and 49 years old. That's when most people are in their twilight, waiting to get to the Champions Tour. And that's when I made most of my hay.","I don't want to go out there and show up. I hate losing. Everybody hates losing. But I hate losing.","You worked your paper route, mowed the lawn, then played golf all day.","I would say that my downswing mirrors the path of my backswing pretty closely.","I'm not here just to walk two rounds or four rounds and just show up. I want to be able to be competitive, and I truly believe I can still be competitive when I'm playing well and feeling good.","Augusta is a very unique golf course. It's a long hitters' course; main reason is because the greens are so severe, and the areas where they put the pin is such a small area. The little plateaus and undulations mean it's incredibly important to be close to that pin so you can be aggressive.","The PGA Tour has a lot of interaction with our military, and I've grown to have an incredible respect for our troops who are coming home with these horrific injuries, as well as any organization that can not only help them get healed up, but help them get integrated back into society.","Stryker was a company that allowed me, when I had my knee replaced and I got the Stryker GetAroundKnee put in, to get my career back and get my life back.","A couple of weeks before the 1992 Houston Open, I was probably as low as I could get confidence-wise. I didn't think I was going to go any further, and then, out of nowhere, I won that week. That kind of got me going.","I had never heard of staph until I got it. Didn't really know what was. Still don't really know what it is, but I know you just don't want to have it."],"Fred G. Gosman":["Ignoring a child's disrespect is the surest guarantee that it will continue.","We must return optimism to our parenting. To focus on the joys, not the hassles; the love, not the disappointments; the common sense, not the complexities.","Teenagers who are never required to vacuum are living in one.","The more we shelter children from every disappointment, the more devastating future disappointments will be.","Taking a child to the toy store is the nearest thing to a death wish parents can have.","A child who has never fantasized about having other parents is seriously lacking in imagination."],"Fred Gwynne":["I love making puns.","When I was a teenager, I wanted to be a portrait painter. As I got to be older, I realized that as a portrait painter I wouldn't be able to support a goldfish.","I decided to take a stab at acting. I entered the American Academy of Dramatic Art, where one teacher told me I'd never make it - I was too tall."],"Fred Hammond":["We sing inspirational songs, songs of praise and worship, and about how good and how big God is. We are magnifying the Lord.","No weapon formed against me shall prosper.","I think people really want to see the real because the world is portrayed at such a low level that if you come out with a real wholesome show, people don't want to see that anymore.","The Bible is a novel that's crazy... it has murder, it has victory it has mayhem, it has disaster, it has war, sanctification.","I believe I was born for this, to tell people about the Lord. I just wanted to find the best way that I could do it, and music, God graced me to be able to do it, and that was the way that I chose to be effective and tell people that the Lord loves them.","I was in a marriage, and we didn't make it. So my hope is, through my music, I can help heal some relationships that may be headed in that direction.","I am just so appreciative of God's love. It's higher than any mountain, wider than any ocean, and wider than the whole universe. His love is just that amazing!","Women are a key part of the sound of the groups that accompany male singers like Kirk Franklin, Israel Houghton, and myself."],"Fred Hampton":["We're going to fight racism not with racism, but we're going to fight with solidarity. We say we're not going to fight capitalism with black capitalism, but we're going to fight it with socialism.","We ain't gonna fight no reactionary pigs who run up and down the street being reactionary; we're gonna organize and dedicate ourselves to revolutionary political power and teach ourselves the specific needs of resisting the power structure, arm ourselves, and we're gonna fight reactionary pigs with international proletarian revolution.","We might not be back. I might be in jail. I might be anywhere. But when I leave, you'll remember I said, with the last words on my lips, that I am a revolutionary. And you're going to have to keep on saying that. You're going to have to say that I am a proletariat; I am the people.","I'm not afraid to say I'm at war with the pigs.","You can't build a revolution with no education. Jomo Kenyatta did this in Africa, and because the people were not educated, he became as much an oppressor as the people he overthrew.","With no education, you have neocolonialism instead of colonialism, like you've got in Africa now and like you've got in Haiti. So what we're talking about is there has to be an educational program. That's very important.","Black people need some peace. White people need some peace. And we are going to have to fight. We're going to have to struggle. We're going to have to struggle relentlessly to bring about some peace, because the people that we're asking for peace, they are a bunch of megalomaniac warmongers, and they don't even understand what peace means.","If you ever think about me, and you ain't gonna do no revolutionary act, forget about me. I don't want myself on your mind if you're not going to work for the people.","I have a lot of respect for Martin Luther King. I think he was one of the greatest orators that the country ever produced.","Yes, we do defend our office as we do defend our homes. This is a constitutional right everybody has, and nothing's funny about that. The only reason they get mad at the Black Panther Party when you do it is for the simple reason that we're political.","You can kill a revolutionary but you can never kill the revolution.","You have to understand that people have to pay a price for peace. If you dare to struggle, you dare to win.","We're not a racist organization, because we understand that racism is an excuse used for capitalism, and we know that racism is just - it's a byproduct of capitalism.","The Black Panther Party stood up and said that we don't care what anybody says. We don't think fighting fire with fire is best; we think you fight fire with water best.","Let me just say: Peace to you, if you're willing to fight for it.","You can jail a revolutionary, but you can't jail the revolution.","A lot of people think the Breakfast for Children program is charity. But what does it do? It takes the people from a stage to another stage. Any program that's revolutionary is an advancing program. Revolution is change.","We say primarily that the priority of this struggle is class. That Marx and Lenin and Che Guevara and Mao Tse-Tung, and anybody else who ever said or knew or practiced anything about revolution, always said that a revolution is a class struggle.","Everything would be alright if everything was put back in the hands of the people, and we're going to have to put it back in the hands of the people.","People have to be armed to have power, you see.","I went down to the prison in Menard, thinking we were the vanguard, but down there, I got down on my knees and listened and learned from the people.","We do not support people who are anarchistic, opportunistic, adventuristic, and Custeristic.","We say that we will work with anybody and form a coalition with anybody that has revolution on their mind.","I believe I'm going to die doing the things I was born to do. I believe I'm going to die high off the people. I believe I'm going to die a revolutionary in the international revolutionary proletarian struggle.","I am the people, I'm not the pig. You got to make a distinction. And the people are going to have to attack the pigs. The people are going to have to stand up against the pigs. That's what the Panthers is doing, that's what the Panthers are doing all over the world.","A lot of people don't understand the Black Panthers Party's relationship with white mother country radicals."],"Fred Hoyle":["The man who voyages strange seas must of necessity be a little unsure of himself. It is the man with the flashy air of knowing everything, who is always with it, that we should beware of.","There is a coherent plan in the universe, though I don't know what it's a plan for.","Things are the way they are because they were the way they were.","Space isn't remote at all. It's only an hour's drive away if your car could go straight upwards.","I don't see the logic of rejecting data just because they seem incredible.","Once I had learnt my twelve times table (at the age of three) it was downhill all the way."],"Fred Kaplan":["Can a great artist be mean-spirited, grasping, harsh to his family, violent in his emotions, vindictive in his hatreds, an all-purpose scoundrel? If our test cases are the likes of Wagner, Picasso, and, let me say, Dickens, the answer is a resounding yes.","It should be quite clear that it is possible for unpleasant people who are small in various ways other than in their artistic genius to produce great art. Art and morality have no necessary connection.","I'm not a Lincoln expert, rather a biographer who has had the pleasure of reading much of what has been written about him from his lifetime to this year of his bicentennial. Some advice: Don't try that unless you have at least five years available.","With all due respect to re-enactors, I consider the Civil War too tragic a subject to make a game of.","A recommendation to scholars: Write only one book about Lincoln; give it your best shot, and then move on.","Words about Lincoln fill a small but ever-growing library.","Lincoln is distinguished from every other president, with the exception of Jefferson, in that we can be certain that he wrote every word to which his name is attached.","The challenge of a president himself struggling to find the conjunction between the right words and honest expression, a use of language that respects intellect, truth, and sincerity, has largely been abandoned.","The value of Eric Foner's 'The Fiery Trial' lies in its comprehensive review of mostly familiar material; in its sensible evaluation of the full range of information already available about Abraham Lincoln and slavery; and in the deft thoroughness of its scholarship.","To give credit to Lincoln for moral progression seems beyond the facts and unnecessary for our appreciation of this arguably greatest of all American presidents.","Reading Edmund Morris's 'Colonel Roosevelt' is a rewarding journey, as it must also have been for its author, who concludes his three-volume saga begun in 1980 with publication of 'The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt.'","'Colonel Roosevelt' is compelling reading, and Morris a brilliant biographer who practices his art at the highest level.","In his life, Charles Dickens was like the rest of us, but maybe more so: another poor and wonderful soul attempting to deal with his and the world's pain and confusion in the best way he knew how.","Is there really any relationship between artists' personal conduct and their art? Certainly not.","Political history is not the only way to approach historical figures.","Gore Vidal was a man of immense literary talent, some of which he used well, some of which he wasted.","I got to know Gore Vidal quite well, up front and personal: his magnificent strengths and his appalling, almost other-worldly weaknesses.","Lincoln is a genius of language and a brilliant writer who deserves to be seen as part of the canon of great writers in American literature.","Obama is a very fine writer with an excellent command of language. His memoir 'Dreams From My Father' is a fine book, but it will not rank as one of the great autobiographies.","Lincoln was the Twain of our politics.","We do ourselves a disservice when we self-servingly massage the record.","I started out as a writer of fiction, but nobody wanted to publish my work as a young man. So I decided to put my interest in the narrative writing of biographies.","Serious biographies need to have a historical base in facts.","I first wrote a biography of Thomas Carlyle, and it turned out I loved writing biographies and had a talent for it. I believed I had a contribution to make.","I want to contribute to the culture and keep great writers alive by telling the stories of their lives.","Myth and mythology often serve constructive and aspirational purposes. But they also do harm.","The post-assassination Lincoln took on a greatly amplified importance to much of the American public, probably the president most deeply reviled in his lifetime and mostly highly regarded after his death."],"Fred Kavli":["As we gain more knowledge about materials and processes in the universe, that could open up benefits that we can't even imagine. But you have to be willing to fund science without knowledge of the benefits.","Basic research is to work at the very edge, the very border of, of knowledge, and move that border forward. You look and look for new secrets, and you don't know where it's going to lead you.","I used to ski across the vast white expanses of a quiet and lonely mountaintop. In the stillness and solitude... I pondered the mysteries of the universe, the planet, nature and of man. I'm still pondering.","Physics is the most basic part of science and, of course, math. It gives you insight into everything - a foundation, I should say, to understand nature and the universe.","I had long planned to start a foundation. I wanted to do something with long-range benefit to humanity. Starting a business and making a lot of money doesn't make for a fulfilling life."],"Fred Korematsu":["I don't even know how it is to have a home. I feel like an orphan or something.","As long as my record stands in federal court, any American citizen can be held in prison or concentration camps without a trial or a hearing.","I was an American citizen, and I had as many rights as anyone else.","If you have the feeling that something is wrong, don't be afraid to speak up.","One person can make a difference, even if it takes forty years.","I'm Asian, so they assumed I'm not an American and that I come from Japan. Restaurants would refuse to serve me, and places would refuse to give you a haircut.","I thought what the military was doing was unconstitutional.","I was really upset because I was branded as an enemy alien when I'm an American.","If anyone should do any pardoning. I should be the one pardoning the government for what they did to the Japanese-American people.","I still remember, 40 years ago, when I was shackled and put in prison... Being an American citizen didn't mean a thing.","It takes a lot of money to hire an attorney.","I was just living my life, and that's what I wanted to do.","Every day in school, we said the pledge to the flag, 'with liberty and justice for all,' and I believed all that.","I didn't think that the government would go as far as to include American citizens to be interned without a hearing.","As a citizen of the United States, I am ready, willing, and able to bear arms for this country.","Before the war, my parents were very proud people. They'd always talk about Japan and also about the samurai and things like that. Right after Pearl Harbor, they were just real quiet. They kept to themselves; they were afraid to talk about what could happen. I assume they knew that nothing good would come out of it.","During the curfew, whoever went out, the people were watching you. Any Japanese home, there was some person figuring he's a good American citizen by doing his duty, and they were watching every move each family were doin'. Or if they went out, they followed them to see where they were goin'.","It may take time to prove you're right, but you have to stick to it.","All of them turned their backs on me at that time because they thought I was a troublemaker.","I lost everything when they put us in prison. I was an enemy alien, a man without a country.","I was very upset because I did not have a fair trial to prove my loyalty to this country.","I was born in the U.S. This is my country.","I was the third son, and the family tradition was my dad always favored the oldest child.","That was it - I lost my job... I was very discouraged. I wanted to be in defense work... I'm an American, and I have nothin' to do with Japan, and so it's sort of an insult to me.","My folks were so worried about what they were going to do. All they can take was what they could carry with their hands. What they had for twenty-five years of building their business was going to go out the door, or they're going to lose it."],"Fred L. Turner":["You need to decide what problems, what opportunities, what projects you're going to work on.","I think the ability to focus is a thread that runs through so-called successful people. And that's something that can be developed. It can be self-taught.","You can't work on 15 problems at the same time.","If I had been a bricklayer I'd still have been a journeyman.","There were around 1,000 stores when I was made president.","We've got a low turnover management group and executive group who've grown up in the business.","I get a bit of a kick out of exporting private enterprise and incentives.","Work hard, use your common sense and don't be afraid to trust your instincts.","People who are employed in a way they don't like - my heart cries for them."],"Fred Melamed":["I always think of the character as being me. But me wearing a 'coat', which may be a different way of speaking, moving or regarding other people. To me, acting is pretending, just like kids playing, only you pretend as if it were really, really real.","I haven't appeared on stage in quite a long time and I don't have any immediate plans to do so, but I'm always interested in going back.","Well, because I have twin seven-year-old boys, I enjoy the gift giving stuff a great deal. We do both Hanukkah and Christmas, so it is a costly, though extremely pleasing proposition.","It probably goes without saying that I enjoy the potato pancakes, delicious hams and so forth that maddeningly turn up at this time of year.","I don't really know of the Jewish tradition of comedy, only the Jewish tradition of not keeping your mouth shut. Complaining about all that is hard, unfair or ridiculous in life-having strong feelings, and not being able to suppress them. That, to me, is Jewish.","I have two young children with autism. What could they have ever done to deserve that? What kind of a God allows the innocent to suffer? It's a mystery. Yet still, I believe in God.","We must agree to live in this world, with all that is unfair about it, without knowing why, if we wish to have a God in our lives.","I am tolerably ignorant about Judaism, and much of what I do know about it seems hard to swallow, because it is so grounded in legalism, and adherence to rituals.","Though I acted in hundreds of productions, appeared at the Guthrie Theatre and on Broadway in Amadeus, I discovered in my thirties that I didn't really like stage acting. The presence of the audience, the eight shows a week and the possibility of a long run were all unnatural to me.","Most of the time when I receive a script, it says something like 'Rosenberg is the fat, slovenly Mayor, who doesn't want the kids to use the Skateboard Park', or 'Stein is a pompous, rotund attorney, imposing to all.' It would be so freeing to get a script where my character is simply described as 'A Man.'","I have a secret aspiration to be considered for a part where it doesn't matter what you look like to play it.","I'm one of relatively few stage-trained actors who doesn't much like acting on stage. It feels kind of like riding the Cyclone at Coney Island, which I did when I was eight. When it was all over, I was glad I had done it, but most of the time when it was actually happening, I was just kind of hanging on for dear life."],"Fred Perry":["Tactics, fitness, stroke ability, adaptability, experience, and sportsmanship are all necessary for winning.","I didn't aspire to be a good sport; 'champion' was good enough for me.","McEnroe has got to sit down and work out where he stands.","To its great credit, Wimbledon has been a leader in bringing about change and improvement in the sport."],"Fred Rogers":["Play is often talked about as if it were a relief from serious learning. But for children play is serious learning. Play is really the work of childhood.","When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, 'Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.'","Knowing that we can be loved exactly as we are gives us all the best opportunity for growing into the healthiest of people.","You know, you don't have to look like everybody else to be acceptable and to feel acceptable.","Parents are like shuttles on a loom. They join the threads of the past with threads of the future and leave their own bright patterns as they go.","How sad it is that we give up on people who are just like us.","I think of discipline as the continual everyday process of helping a child learn self-discipline.","I like to compare the holiday season with the way a child listens to a favorite story. The pleasure is in the familiar way the story begins, the anticipation of familiar turns it takes, the familiar moments of suspense, and the familiar climax and ending."],"Fred Saberhagen":["And what we know, or think we know, about the universe of space and time is changing very quickly.","At this stage, my chief professional goal is simply to keep on writing and making a living at it.","I have some good stories yet to tell.","I started writing seriously about 1960, at the fairly advanced age of 30.","I wouldn't like to just do one story or one type of stories all the time.","I wrote speculative fiction because I loved to read it, and thought I could do better than some of the people who were getting published.","Mysteries I read for fun, so I will probably never write one, for fear of spoiling the fun.","Probably all the books I've ever written have been efforts to define the boundaries of humanity.","Research is of considerable importance in certain fields, such as science and history.","The Berserkers have been with me for about forty years, and we're not done yet.","The same tools that make any writer good, plus a cheerful willingness to suspend belief.","There's a big overlap with the people you meet at the fantasy and science fiction cons.","I don't know why a computer game can't be an art form just as a puppet show or an opera is. I'm still interested in computer games as something I would like to work on someday.","I finally decided one day, reading science fiction magazines of the time, I could do at least as well as some of these people are doing. So I finally made a serious effort.","I suspect that writer's block afflicts mainly people who have some stable and ample source of income outside of writing. So far it hasn't been a problem.","More immediately, I'm currently working on another Dracula in which there will be connections with ancient Egypt. That's about as far as I want to go in commenting on current work.","My gut feeling is that paper and ink are going to be with us for a long time yet, and in substantial quantities, though certainly books are now going to be available in other forms.","Only towards the end of this process are any of the chapters in fully readable condition, a state of affairs that used to alarm my wife. But Joan's got used to it.","Actually ideas are everywhere. It's the paperwork, that is, sitting down and thinking them into a coherent story, trying to find just the right words, that can and usually does get to be labor.","I doubt I'll ever do another book collaboration; I've been spoiled. Roger and I both happened to move to New Mexico at about the same time, when we each had a family of young kids to raise. Socializing seemed to lead naturally to working together.","I guess if one set of my books was selling like Stephen King's, and the other wasn't selling at all, editors would want me to do the ones that sold like Stephen King's. But they seem to be willing to let me pick what I want to do next.","I had immediate success in the sense that I sold something right off the bat. I thought it was going to be a piece of cake and it really wasn't. I have drawers full of - or I did have - drawers full of rejection slips.","If people ask me for the ingredients of success, I say one is talent, two is stubbornness or determination, and third is sheer luck. You have to have two out of the three. Any two will probably do.","The advice would be the same for any kind of fiction. Keep writing, and keep sending things out, not to friends and relatives, but to people who have the power to buy. A lot of additional, useful tips could be added, but this is fundamental.","The comments I most appreciate come from ordinary readers who've happened on one of my books at some time of stress in their lives, and who actually credit the book with helping them through a bad time. It's happened a few times in forty years.","The Swords were still interesting but by then a cast of characters had started to appear and go on from book to book, and other things about the world began to feel constricting. And there were other things I wanted to do, so I closed the series up and stopped it.","There are interactions with characters within the game which I think are pretty neatly done considering the limitations that you have to work with. I mean, a computer can't really generate a character that talks back and forth with you successfully."],"Fred Savage":["I think we all have a little dark side we keep under wraps.","I love to unwind and watch movies, especially those from the classic black-and-white era.","I am an English major in school with an emphasis in creative writing. I think hearing Maya Angelou speak at school last year was one of the best moments Stanford, at least, intellectually, had to offer.","I think it is important to maintain a sense of self and confidence, not letting either falter for the sake of a particular part or project, no matter how great it might be.","I think Kellie Martin, Reese Witherspoon and Claire Danes represent the future for women in film, and I would be honored to share the stage with any one of them.","I would suggest maintaining a life and a career outside the Industry. This is a fickle business and a lousy one to make a steady living in, so it's important to have a good family, friends, job and education to fall back on.","I'd like to see myself married with a child and hopefully still involved in the entertainment business as an actor who is also able to write a bit and direct some projects.","I'd like to work with any actress from whom I can learn-one who has had many experiences with many directors and is willing to share some of her knowledge with me.","It is unfortunate that the poor judgment shown by a small group of young actors has tarnished the reputation of every child who has ever appeared before a camera.","Now that I'm taking some time off from school, I've been reading a lot to make sure I don't forget everything. It's mostly classics and nonfiction accounts from actors, directors and writers from the '40s and '50s.","The only thing that frightens me a little is when I'm called Kevin rather than Fred, but that's how people have known me for so many years. So, I can't really blame them.","The term papers make me more crazy, because they involve more variables I cannot directly control! With acting, I feel more power-like I'm making all the choices.","I promised to always bring up a glass of water to her before we go to bed, and she promised to never let me dress myself.","It's hard to sleep at night because I'm still wondering where my mother is.","Other acting opportunities had come along, but nothing that was tantalizing enough to me to step away from what I found most interesting."],"Fred Schneider":["The hairstyles of most Heavy Metal bands are pretty horrendous.","No, we've been performing our old songs a little differently each performance.","Australians are geniuses with a good sense of humour.","Call us the future from your past.","I am a pacifist.","I rarely watch TV but I guess I'd watch the weather report since I fly so much.","It was a nightmare. The band had to tour Greenland by bus.","Sometimes groups and their material can get overbloated.","You know, Southerners are pretty cool.","I was raised in New Jersey - Long Branch.","I used to like doing karaoke until cell-phone cameras came along."],"Fred Seibert":["If you were to look at an old 'Betty Boop' cartoon or an 'Out of the Ink Well' animation, there are many things about 'Adventure Time' that really remind you of that, even though it doesn't look like any of those cartoons.","Cartoon Hangover has given us another place we felt we could find the most talented people around the world and give them a chance to make the films they want to make and match it up with their audience.","One of the most effective ways we started our web efforts in the early 2000s with our first channel Frederator, we basically showcased 1000's of shows on our show over a few years and what that did was introduce us to talented people from all across the world, you name it, we met people all over the place.","I tell people if I want to make a film I just go make it so you can make yours.","I come from a time when pop music was the coin of the cultural realm and in a certain way was the only coin of the realm; movies didn't matter as much, and not TV - it was all about pop music. In the era when I started - which was the early '60s - it was all about singles leading to albums.","I really like dating stories, like in Betty and Veronica comics; I like David Lynch and H.P. Lovecraft for the dark gut-wrenching stuff, and I'm inspired by Miyazaki's films for the subtle heart-warming moments, as well as the moments that blew up my imagination.","The early seasons of 'The Simpsons' had a great deal of heart. That's what I'm trying to pull from, the kind of stuff that goes straight to kids' hearts. When they're watching, they don't necessarily know why they love something.","Everything about 'Adventure Time' is the purest form of kid's play. A kid does not live in the Land of Ooo. That is one of the wonderful things about the show; it doesn't pretend to be real. That was the great thing about 'Pee Wee's Playhouse'; it existed in a world completely outside any reality a kid recognized.","Up until the time Turner Broadcasting bought Hanna-Barbera, it was essentially an independent studio whose planning cycle had to be nine months. You got a pickup in January, and you put it on the air in September. That's been the cycle.","If you mentioned Hanna-Barbera to people, they said, 'Oh yeah, Flintstone, Yogi, Scooby-Doo, Jetsons,' and that was pretty much it. We have characters with very high recognition factors and great films, but no organized plans for really making the most of them and increasing their value.","My background is that I've spent a lot of time marketing entertainment. One of the old saws in package goods is you can take something that is popular and you can make it more popular. But if you take something less popular, you can't automatically market it into the same success as something that's already popular.","Castle Rock and New Line each have their strengths, but the great thing about New Line is that they are a real focused-market, niche-market player who understand franchises. They probably understand the franchise business in motion pictures better than anyone else out there."],"Fred Silverman":["The first sales meeting I made was for the television movie 'Farrell for the People.' I walked into a conference room at NBC that I had built. It was my memorial conference room. There were 10 people at the meeting, and by habit, I sat at the head of the table.","You find a personality whom you think the TV audience will embrace and find a format that is tailor-made for the personality. In the case of Andy Griffith, we moved the personality of a wily country shark - a funny and shrewd guy - into another arena. In this case, he is a lawyer, and it is a dramatic series.","The kind of audience that watches 'Matlock' is ideal for a lead-in to the affiliates' newscast in the afternoon. That audience is older.","The only way to stop the erosion in network television is to come up with shows that are very popular.","I didn't even think demographics until I got to ABC. They were the first to go for 18-to-49. But, at CBS, it was just, 'Let's get 'em in the tent.'","You acquire certain tastes. And if your taste happens to coincide with the majority of people, then you're in pretty good shape. But you're not always right. There were times when I stubbed my toe, and some will end up being on my tombstone - like 'Supertrain.'","I was the King of Twinkie-Vision one day, the King of Jiggle TV the next, thanks to Farrah Fawcett and 'Three's Company.'","Funny is funny, whether you have three cameras or one.","There seems to be a vulnerability at the networks in late night. They are losing more and more audience, particularly young viewers who are now looking at cable television. 'Tonight' is an old show. CBS has reruns, and having a public affairs series like 'Nightline' on ABC is a big mistake.","Succeeding in network prime time has gotten tougher. Every day, several thousand homes are wired for cable, and more people are buying videodisks and video cassettes. That all represents competition."],"Fred Thompson":["But if the Chinese mainland, the PRC, attacked Taiwan, we'd be obligated to come to their aid.","Sometimes you have to, as I say, build bridges where you can - but draw lines where you must.","Some people think that our planet is suffering from a fever. Now scientists are telling us that Mars is experiencing its own planetary warming: Martian warming. This has led some people, not necessarily scientists, to wonder if Mars and Jupiter, non signatories to the Kyoto Treaty, are actually inhabited by alien SUV-driving industrialists.","Hopefully, we can build bridges, but we also have to draw lines.","There's a lot more to competence than a law degree and a modicum of courtroom skill.","We're hoping for the best, but we need to prepare for the worst.","That is, while we believe that cost-benefit analysis is an important tool to inform agency decision making, the results of the cost-benefit analysis do not trump existing law.","The problem is that agencies sometimes lose sight of common sense as they create regulations.","And I believe in the 13 years Judge Roberts was there, he never turned down a request to give some assistance on a pro-bono case, and this was no different.","And it's difficult for the average American to understand why something like that could be so important and why a little small place like Taiwan would be so important to the PRC.","And when we draw lines in the sand with regard to certain basic things that are vital to our interest and to the interest of democracy and our friends around the world, we have to be willing to back that up.","But obviously, we can't afford to make some bad long-term decisions with regard to basic commitments our country has - trade those away for some short-term assistance that may or may not be there a month from now.","China is one of the world's greatest proliferators of weapons of mass destruction to these rogue nations.","Clearly, the Chinese know that we want a good relationship with them.","For a long time in American history, people didn't even come up before the Senate. They didn't come before the Judiciary Committee, and up until about 1923, something like that.","For example, lead paint in old houses can be a greater threat to children's health than lead that may be under some industrial site where there are no children.","I think that the justices were totally answering the way that they should. I think that the senators, as best I could tell, for the most part, Democrat and Republican, respected that.","I think that there is a relatively small number of people who are pushing for independence in Taiwan.","In the end, we may be hurting the very people we should be concerned about - the inner-city poor, those who already have to live with many risks in their daily lives, those who do not have clout here in Washington.","Let's not overlook, though, what we do know about the campaign finance scandal, and the fact the Chinese were involved in our presidential campaign and our congressional campaigns.","Nobody wants to open a business near a Superfund site and risk being sued.","So China will be having to make some choices as to whose side it wants to be on. Hopefully, this will be the beginning of a major improvement in our relationship with them, if they choose correctly.","So if you look back over the long history of China, they've never tried to take over the world, but they've been quite aggressive in their own neighborhood... in carrying out their own purposes and interests in their sphere of the world.","Superfund was passed with the good intention of cleaning up America's toxic waste sites.","We also have to ask if we focusing on the most important priorities.","We have some real political differences among us, but we all share the same goals: clean air and water, injury free workplaces, safe transportation systems, to name a few of the good things that can come from regulation.","We just ask the agency to make reasonable and honest decisions, and the public deserves no less.","We've made some mistakes in this country in times past - the Korean conflict proceeding that, some say proceeding the Persian Gulf War, where we were ambiguous as to what we would do.","While we believe there are fruitful opportunities to update and improve old rules, we do not want to set up a review process that could create a litigation morass.","You can't substitute promise after promise with known violators of prior promises at the expense of protecting ourselves or setting an example."],"Fred Tomaselli":["There are aspects of Asian culture in my work, but it's really rooted in an American experience - transcendentalism, '60s counterculture, punk rock.","I wouldn't know any other way to live except to be an artist. I'm not very good at anything else.","I like the idea of multidisciplinary conversations, so in that spirit, I try and make a contribution from the art world into the music world.","Art is really about perception, and mine have been changed through visiting other realities.","I'm actually pretty smart when you get to know me.","The small amount of people that control the discourse around painting - I thought that the whole museum world was just a bunch of phonies, and I didn't really want to have anything to do with it. I guess I did installations, in a funny way, because they couldn't be commodified.","I don't embrace irony, but I do think it's a pre-existing condition; we manage it as best we can.","I kind of have a Victorian sensibility - I don't understand stuff until I can classify it and name it.","I worked my way through art school as an auto mechanic, doing various stuff including sanding bodywork and using Bondo filler.","I've come to believe in the primacy of form - the notion of art seducing you through your senses, through your eyeballs.","I don't know if I'm a populist artist, but I do try to maintain a spirit of generosity.","A lot of people don't think of my work as being all that funny, but I think it's hilarious!"],"Fred Upton":["You shouldn't have an overbearing FCC. Let the market work itself. By allowing companies to compete in an unregulated forum, you're going to allow the faster deployment of new services and new equipment consumers are going to want.","For those broadcasters who are less than responsible, the FCC needs to have sharper teeth to enforce the law.","Common sense tells us that this explosion of media sources should eliminate any concern over a lack of diversity of views in the marketplace and competition.","We've heard this before; 'things are bad, we are gonna fix them,' and they remain unfixed.","I think we can lower our emissions. I think the world will be better off if we did that, and we can do it without cap and trade.","Together, we will protect the sanctity of life, ensuring early next Congress that no federal funds are used for abortion.","I look forward to standing shoulder to shoulder with Speaker Boehner, Leader Cantor, Whip McCarthy and the entire republican conference as we repeal Obamacare, fight rampant job killing regulations, cut spending and help put folks back to work.","The Obama administration is on notice - they will not be allowed to regulate what they have been unable to legislate.","Cuts in carbon emissions would mean significantly higher electricity prices. We think the American consumer would prefer not to be skinned by Obama's EPA.","I support an all of the above energy policy, so that's not only just Keystone, that's not only just drilling, that's clean coal, that's safe nuclear.","New discoveries and production of resources like shale oil and gas are dramatically altering our energy supply outlook and the entire global geopolitical landscape. And the pace of change - particularly in the past few years - continues to accelerate.","I'm a Reagan Republican, which means I don't speak ill of other Republicans.","I know the exploding cost of health care is at the root of our long-term fiscal challenges.","People in Michigan are good at separating fact from fiction. They know, better than most of the country, what happens to the economy and jobs when the scales are tipped too far in favor of one group over another.","Our work on light bulbs wasn't an arbitrary mandate. We didn't just pick a standard out of the air, or look for a catchy sounding standard like 25 by 2025 not based in science or feasibility. Instead, we worked with both industry and environmental groups to come up with a standard that made sense and was doable.","If the EPA continues unabated, jobs will be shipped to China and India as energy costs skyrocket. Most of the media attention has focused on the EPA's efforts to regulate climate-change emissions, but that is just the beginning.","We cannot afford the EPA's continued expansion of red tape that is slowing economic growth and threatening to entangle millions of small businesses.","It's critical - that the people that are benefiting today from Medicare and Social Security that they not see benefit reductions. It's awfully hard to tell someone who might be 82, that they've gotta go back to work, because their benefits are gonna be chopped. That's not gonna happen.","I support renewable energy.","I'm not a rubber stamp, and people know that. If you can convince me of the merits, you will have my vote every time.","Without international participation, jobs and emissions will simply shift overseas to countries that require few, if any, environmental protections, harming the global environment as well as the U.S. economy.","Nuclear is not only emissions-free, but renewing our commitment to nuclear power will create countless jobs at a time when our nation endures nearly double-digit unemployment.","Prior to passage of Obamacare, Americans spoke out against the individual mandate; they didn't want to change the health care they had; they didn't want a 3,000-page bill that empowered 15 Washington bureaucrats to decide the future of the doctor-patient relationship.","Americans want and deserve a broad array of health insurance choices so they can identify those that best fit their own individual or family needs. These choices expand when we allow free enterprise to foster innovation, not smother it with taxes and one-size fits all ideology.","Obamacare represents a shocking display of political arrogance. It's about time Washington started listening to Americans' common sense voices.","While the Left seems obsessed with increasing taxes and spending even more money, conservatives have focused more heavily on the need for spending restraint and entitlement reform - primarily to preserve and protect the future of the Medicare program. Overlooked in all of this is the future of Medicaid.","Under President Obama's new health care law, Medicaid will become a very different health coverage program than first envisioned.","Originally created to serve the poorest and sickest among us, the Medicaid program has grown dramatically but still doesn't include the kind of flexibility that states need to provide better health care for the poor and disadvantaged.","The national debate on health care once centered on improving access to quality care, yet the effect of Obamacare will be the exact opposite, resulting in the shameful degradation of care for the neediest individuals.","An imposing wall prominently divides the visions of President Obama and congressional Republicans when it comes to economic growth and creating jobs. Solyndra is on one side and the Keystone pipeline is on the other.","With the discovery of vast new North American energy resources - thanks to the application of proven technologies like hydraulic fracturing and commonsense regulatory processes on non-federal lands - the U.S. government should no longer be in the business of spending taxpayer dollars on risky, exotic energy projects.","Given the slow pace of Washington's bureaucracy, policymakers are often busy solving yesterday's problems. This rearview mirror approach afflicts Mr. Obama and his Democratic allies in Congress.","Obamacare is a seriously flawed law that makes health care coverage less affordable, costs taxpayers more than advertised and fails to deliver on most of its other grand promises.","Giving governors more leeway in administering health care could represent a small, positive development in the ongoing saga of Obamacare. Unfortunately, instead of choosing flexibility, President Obama and his left-leaning advisers always default to rigid 'Washington knows best' answers."],"Fred W. Friendly":["Television was supposed to be a national park. Instead it has become a money machine. It's a commodity now, just like pork bellies.","TV is bigger than any story it reports. It's the greatest teaching tool since the printing press.","A composite is a euphemism for a lie. It's disorderly. It's dishonest and it's not journalism.","Television makes so much at its worst that it can't afford to do its best.","The news is the one thing the networks can point to with pride. Everything else they do is crap, and they know it."],"Fred Ward":["I think we're struggling with trying to redefine various positions at this point in history. To allow freedom for women, freedom for men, freedom from those sharply defined gender roles.","In this play we're dealing with relative truths - who's lying, who's telling the truth. But underneath that, Ed and I have hit this deeper level of intimacy between old friends that comes out in the play.","My career has been a bit strange. I don't think it took the normal route.","When you're a father, you know exactly where your heart really is. There's no question of it, no doubt. That part of your life has no second guessing.","As an actor, it's fun to play guys who aren't just locked into a male pattern, but a lot of guys you're asked to play are fairly macho and have a certain rigid standard they're living by.","I doing casual labor by the day. They wouldn't pay you until the next morning. There was a bar that would cash your check if you bought a beer first. A lot of guys never left until they'd drunk up all their money.","I like to spread myself out. Since I was a kid, I always recognized some void.","I was just talking about women, just in terms of understanding them as much as we can ever understand the opposite sex. I'm trying to let go of certain male approaches to things that you inherit, that you grow up with.","If some woman tells me how she feels about something, my immediate assumption is that she wants an answer, or that she wants me to solve her problem. In fact, all she wants to do is share, or show how she feels.","In the beginning Remo is a very New York street cop who changes and is changed as he moves along.","It's a major part of world history that men are trying to kill each other. It's just one slaughter after the other. We talk about it, but no one's really listening.","It's like a prehistoric reflex, you know, going out and getting the meat and bringing it back to the cave. You feel you're supposed to make it better, but more than likely she's asking you to tell her how you feel.","There was always a creative impulse in me but I never felt rooted to anything.","Trying different things is very important to me. I see people and want to wear their clothes and drive in their cars for awhile. That's probably one reason I became an actor."],"Fred Willard":["I just admire everybody and sit in awe and watch them.","If you're a cheerleader, people see you. If you're a mascot, you're just helping out.","When we need a policeman, God bless 'em, they're there. But, if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time, everything seems suspicious.","Because I started my career in improv, performing with Second City and the Ace Trucking Company, I always enjoy being in situations where - as an actor - you have to think fast & be light on your feet.","I don't know why my lines that were cut from the film didn't make it onto the DVD. I have offered to go into the editing room with Christopher and work shoulder to shoulder with him to fit all my lines in. I think he thinks I'm kidding. I'm only trying to help.","There's different kinds of improv. There's Second City improv where you try to slowly build a nice sketch. There's stuff you do in college coffee houses where you just go joke, joke, joke. Bring another funny character with a funny hat on his head. Christopher Guest is more the line of trying to get a story out.","I have a guy who does my hair. He's a car nut. And he was taking motorcycle lessons. And, what was my point?","I'd love to have Burt Reynolds' career.","I think my wife saw a picture of the rock group Journey, and they're kind of aging, and the one guy had dyed blonde hair with black roots, and... my idea was to get a little earring, I wanted to have a dangling earring.","Suddenly you're like a pirate, you're 65 years old and you've got an earring.","It's more fun in a way to do ensemble scenes, where you know your background, you know the scene, but you can't prepare because someone else is going to say something that is going to lead you off.","It's such a pleasure to work in these movies, it's almost like it's not really happening.","Someone I've always admired is Catherine O'Hara... I think she's one of the best actresses in the country, not only comedy. I just think she's just a step aside from everybody, she's just wonderful.","Cleveland is my hometown, and the Indians have a narrow but rich history.","I once was in a project. They were going to do a remake. Somebody started a rumor I wanted more money. I said, 'This is ridiculous. I'd kill for this project!'","I never think I'm old enough to play someone's dad, even though I have a daughter of my own and a grandson.","I did a show called 'Lois & Clark' - it was about Superman - years ago. They wanted someone to play the president of the United States. The plot was the president got kidnapped by a group, and they made a clone of him, who was very irresponsible and silly.","I've found over the years that for some reason, people either are big fans and have to use me, or they don't quite understand what I'm doing.","God bless Chris Guest... and I mean it sincerely.","I guess it's from going to Virginia Military Institute. I'm a good person to follow orders.","My first improv was Second City in Chicago. Before that, I worked at - with a partner, doing comedy sketches.","It scared me to death to think about improv, but I got hired for a year at Second City in Chicago, which made me nervous, but I found I could improvise. Then I was in a group called the Ace Trucking Company, which we'd do, like, a half hour set of material, then open up for improvisation.","The 'Tim And Eric' experience was very strange.","Christopher Guest, he'll call and say, 'We're doing this movie, and I'd like you to play _' and he gives you the character, then I always like to enlarge on the character.","That's always a funny thing, when people think they're known for every little thing they ever did, and they're really not.","Tobe Hooper - he did my favorite horror movie, 'Texas Chain Saw Massacre.' It's still one of my favorite horror films.","If I have to play an obnoxious character, try to find a redeeming feature of him. The most obnoxious people in the world were people, and they had had a reason for doing what they did. So you try to find that and let the obnoxiousness come out.","I never got any advice in acting.","Let me say this: I have said, any time, if it's Martin Mull, I will say yes. If it's Christopher Guest, I will say yes.","I guess if you're a professional mascot, you're doing it for the money, but a college mascot just wants to be out there.","When you think about accountants, who would want to be an accountant? But, what would we do without accountants? Whether it's soldiers or garbage men or doctors, everyone has the thing that they love.","Bob Balaban is so perfect that the first movie I did with him, I couldn't talk to him because I was so intimidated by him.","All America is familiar with the Yankee-Dodger-Giant trivia, but so many other teams had great moments.","I first became interested in 'great moments' when I read about the famous Feller-to-Boudreau pickoff play in the 1948 World series.","I still think 'Texas Chain Saw Massacre' was what they call one of those watershed movies. That and 'The Exorcist' and 'Psycho' were just landmarks for those horror films.","One of the first shows I ever did was 'Laverne & Shirley.' I played this sleazy guy that came into town with a friend and was going to date Laverne and Shirley, but we really wanted to get into the bowling alley because it was next to the bank we wanted to rob.","Some of the Christopher Guest movies, when I'm not really like myself, when I have my hair dyed blonde or had a faux-hawk haircut. Those I like to watch because it takes you away from your real self.","I think if you have a funny thought, and you want to get off a funny point, try to do it as realistically as you can. If you try to act it funny and accent the funny points, or do it in a funny style, you kind of lose it.","I love sketch; it's my favorite form. But if it's all improv, they're either very good, and it's annoying how good they are, and it makes you feel bad, or they're not too good; then you're sweating for them.","I'll go in a minute to see a sketch show.","It's not a bad typecast: the goofy guy.","I had just done a movie called 'How to Beat the High Cost of Living,' and it didn't get a good review. And the same people sent me the script for 'Airplane!' for the Robert Hays part. I read it, and there were a lot of plays on words, and I said, 'I don't like this kind of comedy.'","I just look back, and I say, you know, Christopher Guest just raised my whole career to another level.","People still quote my lines from 'Best in Show.'","I've been in a lot of shows, I will say that. Every once in a while, I'll look at a tape of something I've done, and I won't even remember having done it.","Getting those parts in the Christopher Guest movies was the second biggest helper to my career after 'Fernwood.'","When I started, there was a phase where I wanted to be a cowboy star. I didn't want to do deep, serious parts.","I loved Bob Hope and the way he would turn to the camera and break the fourth wall.","Comedy always came easier for me. But I would have loved to have been an action hero.","If you're going to take a risk as a comic, make sure it's surrounded by other things that you're certain are funny.","Comedy relieves you. A lot of times, we think we're the only people bothered by certain things. Then you hear a comic say, 'Don't you hate it when...' And it's, 'Oh, my God! Of course!'","A great director is someone who makes you feel like you're moving forward.","One of the great things about kids is they haven't heard a lot of the old jokes. You can get away with the corny ones.","I love to draw, although I wish I was better at it.","I have great respect for the authorities.","As an actor, and as you get to a certain level... and it's pilot season and you read the trades, you could have a nervous breakdown. 'So-and-so's signed for a pilot. Why aren't I?'","Everybody I run into goes, 'Hey, 'Best in Show!'' Or, 'Hey, that dog movie!' which I don't mind because I'm not too good on titles.","In most cities, it doesn't cost much to put your own show on a local access channel, so you get all sorts of strange stuff on the air.","There's this whole underground world of amateur television production.","How can we say any one actor's work was better than another's?","Martin Landau in 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' - he gave me chills.","If I like a movie, I see no reason not to go back for Parts 2, 3, 4, etc.","'Field of Dreams.' Definitely one of the best baseball films of all time. When Kevin Costner spoke to his dad, and his dad answered, I, um, I mean a lot of guys I know couldn't help crying.","I like to play the guy that has no self-awareness.","'Fernwood 2-Night' didn't help me too much when it was first on.","I've never crossed over to be a big star. I'd like to be in a big $100 million movie, though. 'Cause I was in an 'Austin Powers,' I think I had two lines, and every once in a while, I get a check, a really nice check, for that movie.","Comedy is harder, because if there's no laughs, it's pretty bad. But drama, if there's no reaction, you can say, 'Well, it's not their cup of tea. Maybe it's too heavy for the audience.'","With improv or a full length play - you know how you go to a theater, and after 10 minutes you say, 'Oh, I don't like this thing,' but you don't want to get up and leave? At a sketch show, it's always something new every few minutes.","Looking back, I was a very good kid, very studious and all. But I would always come out with a quip - and I was sent to the principal's office several times.","If you're not doing something right, you can feel it on stage, and if it isn't going well, the audience will tell you. A teacher can teach you sense memory and this and that, but until you get in front of an audience, you don't really feel it.","I always loved comedy growing up - Bob Hope, Red Skelton and Danny Kaye.","I have always been more relaxed around comedy.","I used to collect autographs outside of the old Cleveland Stadium. I can still remember everyone who took the time and spent a few minutes to make your day. That sticks with you.","I'll talk your ear off if you recognize me.","After working with Wayne Brady, Colin Mochrie, and Jonathan Mangum, I said, 'I am never going to talk about improv again.'","I think everyone has a door in their brain that says, 'Do not exit here.' If you go past it, you'll find all the dumb thoughts in there, all the stupid things that shouldn't be said. I've probably gone there more than anyone should in a given lifetime.","I've always wanted to be on a soap opera.","I love working with Ty Burrell."],"Fred Wilson":["Venture capital is about capturing the value between the startup phase and the public company phase.","I believe Android will be stronger in the developing world than it is in the developed world.","To see things differently requires you to be wired a little differently.","Building product is not about having a large team to manage. It is about having a small team with the right people on it.","We need new medical approaches to preventing and/or curing disease. We need new scientific approaches to generating, storing, and being more efficient with energy. Maybe we need more space exploration. Maybe we need more undersea exploration.","Given New York City's cultural diversity, it has always attracted creative people.","I don't like to talk about myself. I like to talk about stuff that's happening, stuff that's going to happen, and the people who are going to make it happen.","When I see people laughing at ideas and companies we have backed, I smile. It means we are going to make a lot of money on that investment.","The venture business is a bit of an apprenticeship business, so the firm I worked for didn't let me make an investment until I was 30. That was probably a very smart thing.","Start-ups should be hunch-driven early on and data-driven as they scale.","So many folks in the venture capital business are sheep that just want to follow the herd. They are momentum investors purchasing highly illiquid investments. That is a recipe for disaster.","Customers are a great way to finance a business for many reasons. First, customer financing is typically non dilutive. They want something from you other than equity in your business. Customers also help you fit your product to the market. And customers will help debug and improve the quality of the product.","Investing in management means building communication systems, business processes, feedback, and routines that let you scale the business and team as efficiently as possible.","All markets have boom and bust cycles, and I think venture capital market has even more exaggerated boom and bust cycles.","The Internet is a computing platform built on top of core technology. Applied technology is what gets built on top of that: It's Web services.","It's not easy for an entrepreneur to find the time to blog. But for those who do it, it is a great tool to communicate with the various stakeholders in their business and build a reputation for thought leadership.","I generally blog between 5:30 A.M. and 7 A.M. I will from time to time add something during the day, but for the most part blogging is an early morning activity for me.","My venture investing career has three phases, all roughly 6-8 years long. The first, at Euclid, was software to Internet. The second, at Flatiron, was Internet to bubble. And the third, at USV, has been web 2 to mobile. I have always used a new firm to denote a new investment phase for me. Throw away the old. Start with the new.","One of the great things about young entrepreneurs is that they don't know that something can't be done. So they try something that's so audacious and usually end up pulling it off.","I'm a free speech bigot. I don't like censorship; I just don't think it's a good thing.","Twitter wasn't planned. It just happened.","If you have a native monetization system where the atomic unit of content is the ad unit, that scales down all the way to a small screen experience. That's why Twitter is performing so well on mobile.","It's upsetting to me that you have to be a millionaire to invest in your friend's start-up.","The more entrepreneurs in the world that are getting their ideas financed, the more great companies there are going to be that we can all invest in.","I think 'crazy' is a compliment. I think you make money with people who are crazy.","There is a difference between hiring a CEO and turning over control of the business.","The companies that do the best job on managing a user's privacy will be the companies that ultimately are the most successful.","Venture capitalists are professional money managers. We are provided capital to invest as long as we can return it to our investors with a strong return in a reasonable amount of time. A strong return is three times cash on cash. A reasonable amount of time is ten years max.","Internet and mobile product development cycles are measured in months, not years. And the capital required to get a product built and into the market is less than $1 million. And the returns, when things work out, can be enormous.","I believe the mobile OS market will play out very similarly to Windows and Macintosh, with Android in the role of Windows. And so, if you want to be in front of the largest number of users, you need to be on Android.","Facebook is not an unstoppable juggernaut. There are a lot of other things people can do on the web.","The most common way customer financing is done is you sell the customer on the product before you've built it or before you've finished it. The customer puts up the money to build the product or finish the product and becomes your first customer. Usually the customer simply wants the product and nothing more.","It takes great salesmanship to convince a customer to buy something from you that isn't built or isn't finished.","Equity capital is expensive. Every time you do a raise, you dilute.","Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr are all 'User First, Brands Second' services. The brands are all over these services now. But for the most part, these services didn't do much to bring them. The engaged users did.","There are so many startups out there raising money. I don't think this is a bad thing. It's a good thing. Entrepreneurship is in vogue. Innovators are innovating. Makers are making.","Being an entrepreneur is hard. Having supportive and caring investors helps.","Skyping with your spouse works well enough, but apparently it is hard to get the kids to hang out on Skype for long.","When my dad was in Vietnam, we lost a parent for a year. Thank God we didn't lose a parent for good.","Not only do you have to put yourself in harms way in service of your country, you have to leave your families at home. It is a great sacrifice.","Startups are rapidly changing systems. If you use an annual review cycle, you aren't getting feedback at the same pace that you need to adapt and change the business.","If you are successful, you will be cloned. That's life. In fact, it's a sign that you've made it when clones of your website, mobile app, and business start cropping up.","Many artists stick to making and hire a manager to focus on their business. Artists that build websites and mobile apps can do that, too.","The entire world is now a rival to Silicon Valley. No country, state, region, nor city has a lock on innovation in technology anymore.","Games are the most social of all things on the web.","Foursquare's adoption of a game dynamic when it launched is a particularly clever implementation of a social hook.","Marketing is for companies who have sucky products.","Board meetings should not be for the benefit of the board. They should be for the benefit of the CEO and the senior team.","Politics and government have been a terrible place to invest; education has been a terrible place to invest, but that is because the entrenched interests make it a terrible place to invest. The way you invest in those sectors is you go against the entrenched interests; you try and disrupt the entrenched interests, not to service them.","New York's niche is content, and content is becoming more valuable. Just think about what is more valuable: MTV or the cable system that you use to get MTV? Howard Stern or the radio station you use to listen to him? Ultimately, technology becomes a commodity, and content - real, true branded content - becomes more valuable.","Certainly anything that is news or opinion needs to be free on the Web, because the Web is this very fluid medium that is very much driven by links and the flow of visitors through a discussion via links.","Most adults I know start their Internet session at Google, and most kids I know start their Internet session at either Facebook or MySpace.","When there were not very many Internet companies, the supply of Internet companies to the market was small and the appetite for them was large. Therefore, if you were in the business of creating Internet companies in 1996-98, you had a market that provided massive demand for that.","People already love to play casual games. But when you take a casual game and stick it inside a social network, it becomes way more exciting.","When people laugh at a company or say, 'This is the stupidest thing I have ever heard,' you are listening.","Yahoo is free, it's fast and it's Web-centric. AOL is slow, it costs money and requires proprietary software.","The best talent in the venture industry doesn't work in large companies and won't work in large companies.","The Web is going to capture an increasing share of people's attention, and billions of dollars are going to flow in. What Web 2.0 is about is harnessing those dollars in highly leverageable ways.","I'm not saying M.B.A.s can't be great entrepreneurs. They can. But you don't need a degree to figure out it's costing you $5,000 per month to run your business, so you need $30,000 to keep it going for six more months.","Money is information, like bits.","Blog-based businesses have lower cost structures and are more 'authentic,' and as a result are drawing larger shares of ad budgets.","I would like to reiterate that I don't want any profiles of me. I am not newsworthy.","Profiles aren't journalism.","I'm really interested in the intersection between reputation, identity, and knowledge."],"Fred Woodworth":["Government is an unnecessary evil. Human beings, when accustomed to taking responsibility for their own behavior, can cooperate on a basis of mutual trust and helpfulness.","It seems like such a terrible shame that innocent civilians have to get hurt in wars, otherwise combat would be such a wonderfully healthy way to rid the human race of unneeded trash.","If human beings are fundamentally good, no government is necessary; if they are fundamentally bad, any government, being composed of human beings, would be bad also."],"Freda Adler":["Rape is the only crime in which the victim becomes the accused.","Major social movements eventually fade into the landscape not because they have diminished but because they have become a permanent part of our perceptions and experience.","Woman throughout the ages has been mistress to the law, as man has been its master.","Stripped of ethical rationalizations and philosophical pretensions, a crime is anything that a group in power chooses to prohibit.","The passionate controversies of one era are viewed as sterile preoccupations by another, for knowledge alters what we seek as well as what we find.","That man is a creature who needs order yet yearns for change is the creative contradiction at the heart of the laws which structure his conformity and define his deviancy.","The Rubicons which women must cross, the sex barriers which they must breach, are ultimately those that exist in their own minds.","There is another side to chivalry. If it dispenses leniency, it may with equal justification invoke control.","The type of fig leaf which each culture employs to cover its social taboos offers a twofold description of its morality. It reveals that certain unacknowledged behavior exists and it suggests the form that such behavior takes."],"Freddie Freeman":["I love coming home.","For me, feeling good is line drives to left field.","There's nothing I can really do but keep going out there and swinging.","In the past, my success has come with sticking to one plan. That usually works. Obviously it's going to falter, and I'm going to go into slumps here and there, but stick with the plan, and hopefully it will come out successful more times than not.","Just got to keep going out there and keep swinging. That's all I can really do. Getting work in, doing everything I can to get ready for the game.","When you come back on top after you've fallen, it's a better story.","I always like going to the West Coast. I don't know if it's a certain field, team, whatever it is, but I usually seem to do well here.","When you lose a mother or father, it's still the hardest time of your life.","I want to represent Canada so I can represent my mother.","I stick to what got me here and what I know best. That's the same routine. I'm not going to vary it.","You think about when you're kids and see these guys on TV, and now you're in the same clubhouse as Chipper Jones and Bobby Cox.","It's just so much fun to relax and just play baseball for a living. It's a great time in my life. I'm never going to forget it, and it's very humbling.","They said if I could deal with the pain, I should play. So, I did, and for some reason, I started hitting. It was a weird thing. I don't know if it was because I couldn't do too much, and I was just trying to stay up through the middle and not hurt myself.","Sometimes, you can get too big when you feel too good.","Usually, my track record's pretty good with guys on base.","Usually, I can get the job done with guys in scoring position.","I would like to be out there every day and be that one steady guy that everybody can lean on.","I have one goal every single year, and that's to play every single game.","Enjoy and have fun when you're a kid, because you are a kid.","Just have fun, and just play hard, and just practice a lot.","When I played Little League, I looked up to the big leaguers, too, and collected their baseball cards.","Thrilling, thrilling to see yourself on a baseball card for the first time.","Leading off an inning you never know, I could get a bunt base hit and start a rally.","I think this world needs a little more hugging in their lives.","Coming in here and having fun with the guys, loving everyone, playing this game - it's a lot of fun.","If I don't get hits, I don't get hits, but I'm trying to get hits.","I'm going to go out there and just keep trying to get better.","I don't really watch video, but I see the replay; like when I do strike out, and I'm walking back to the dugout, I look up and see if they do show the replay of me swinging and missing.","I've never been a guy that's consistently hit home runs. It's always seemed to come, like, three or four in a week or two, and then I'll shut it down for a couple of weeks.","Obviously, being a first baseman, you're kind of expected to hit some home runs. Obviously, that goes into your head; it gets into my head a little bit.","You've just got to keep grinding, putting good ABs together; just stop trying to look at the record, your batting average. You've got to go out there and just keep playing.","I'd like to finish my career as a Brave.","I'm one of those guys who loses weight during the season.","Growing up in California, I grew up a JT Snow fan.","Darren Erstad was special to watch when he moved from center field from first base.","I grew up an Angels fan.","There are certain guys you just take from different teams that you watch.","You got to put the personal stuff away and see the business side of it.","You're going to be friends with people longer than you're going to be teammates in this game.","I think about my mom every day.","It's something I'd never wish anybody to have to go through, having a mother pass away at a young age. But it's made me realize that people need help.","I have a platform to be able to do something to help other people beat cancer."],"Freddie Highmore":["When you're happy you don't always have to be laughing, and when you're sad you don't have to be crying; sometimes it's the opposite. You laugh when you're the most upset.","I'm not a sad person, upset the whole time, but I seem to be quite emotional.","As always, with acting, you can't be too self-conscious. You shouldn't care about what people are thinking about you at the time because they're not caring about you, they're caring about the character.","I like all sorts of chocolate. Milk chocolate, dark chocolate, anything.","I'm pretty rubbish, as we say in Britain, artwise, and I always envy people who can pick up something and even do just a little doodle of someone that looks vaguely like them. It's impressive.","I like to go to bed early so I can get up early.","Don't get too set on becoming an actor at an early age. I think that's where some people get into trouble. Acting becomes their life. I don't want that.","I have a younger brother.","Every day is a different day in New York; there's always something new going on.","I like hot weather. I think it might be a bit better if England was a bit hotter.","I wish I could draw.","I think in some ways I'm quite lucky to be living in London, there's this certain separation from the movie business. In that way, it's been quite easy to separate acting and going back to a normal life.","For every different role you play it's nice to have different challenges for each one.","People have different expectations when you're younger - it's less about changing yourself into a character; they want a more natural thing. And they just want you to be able to turn up every day and carry on working. They have a horrible fear of 10- or 11-year-olds, that they're going to say 'I don't want to play today.'","People build up a picture of Johnny Depp as being some sort of weird pirate character. In reality he's incredibly nice... one of the nicest people I've ever met.","It's very nice having my mum as my agent. You know that she's always doing what's best for you.","I've never been a great cook.","'Cinema Paradiso' is a fantastic film, I love that.","I never really acted at school. It was doing small parts on TV that really got me started.","There's never been a particular band that I've followed religiously. But I do tend to listen to sadder music.","I think a lot of the time having someone who you, not base yourself on, but can see yourself being after a few years, you can get quite blinded by that, in the same way love can be.","I always tend to see, right after reading the script, the character and how I want to play it. I guess that's sort of most of the work, preparing for the role, but almost the creation of the character seems to go on as I read through the script.","I've got a good family to support me, so I'm grounded in that way.","Scary is good. Kids like going to a movie and being really scared rather than fake scared.","Johnny Depp is probably the best actor.","I'm sure everyone has many types of music that they enjoy.","I guess I'm just a normal kid apart from the acting."],"Freddie Hubbard":["I advise all the young kids to not overwork. You can't be out there blowing hard. You have to pace yourself.","I quit drinking, so I can think clear. When you have chop trouble, drinking doesn't help the healing process.","We all kind of grew up together with Art Blakey because we all were young and he gave us a chance to write. We had to write something that was good and to sit up with a great guy like Art Blakey and watch him.","Dizzy used to tell me that I am playing too hard. He used to say to not give everything. Miles used to tell me that too.","I am in discussions with a label. We are talking about doing something.","I had heard Ornette a couple of times, but I didn't really know where he was coming from until we started the record and it was beautiful, Fred. It opened up my mind.","I'm going to Yoshi's. I'm taking a few gigs. I'm playing. I'm not going to play all the time. I'm going to take it easy and take it slow and warm up so I can come back.","That was the biggest thrill, going over to these guy's houses and having them want me to practice with them and they would show me a lot of stuff, which was really advanced stuff to me at my age.","They always want to sell me as a hard bopper.","Well, my sister played trumpet. Can you imagine having a sister blowing the trumpet around the house, Fred? And my brother, he played piano. Everybody was playing some kind of music, so it was natural for me to get into it.","When I got started in New York, it wasn't like it is now. If you were different from Miles and Dizzy, it was very difficult to make gigs and make money with your own style.","Yes, I can play. I can play. I can't play as long as I did and as hard, but I don't think I have to."],"Freddie Mercury":["I won't be a rock star. I will be a legend.","I dress to kill, but tastefully.","When the whole point of Queen was to be original.","I'm just a musical prostitute, my dear.","A concert is not a live rendition of our album. It's a theatrica! event.","Who wants to live forever?","I have fun with my clothes onstage; it's not a concert you're seeing, it's a fashion show.","When I'm dead, I want to be remembered as a musician of some worth and substance.","What will I be doing in twenty years' time? I'll be dead, darling! Are you crazy?","I'm very emotional; I think I may go mad in several years' time.","The reason we're successful, darling? My overall charisma, of course.","I always knew I was a star And now, the rest of the world seems to agree with me.","I want to lead the Victorian life, surrounded by exquisite clutter.","In the early days, we just wore black onstage. Very bold, my dear. Then we introduced white, for variety, and it simply grew and grew.","The others don't like my interviews. And frankly, I don't care much for theirs.","I'm hopeless with money; I simply spend what I've got.","Is Billy Idol just doing a bad Elvis pout, or was he born that way?","Money may not buy happiness, but it can damn well give it!","I like to be surrounded by splendid things.","It destroys the soul to hear that you're all hype, that you have no talent, and that your whole career has been contrived.","And, we have no such thing as a budget anymore. Our manager freaks when we show him the bill. We're lavish to the bone, but all our money goes back into the product.","I was never too keen on the British music press. They've called us a supermarket hype, and they used to suggest that we didn't write our own songs.","The lavish presentation appeals to me, and I've got to convince the others.","We're a very expensive group; we break a lot of rules. It's unheard of to combine opera with a rock theme, my dear .","Years ago, I thought up the name Queen. It's just a name. But it's regal, obviously, and -sounds splendid.","You know, I designed the Queen crest. I simply combined all the creatures that represent our star signs-and I don't even believe in astrology.","I guess I've always lived the glamorous life of a star. It 's nothing new - I used to spend down to the last dime.","If we're weird onstage, I don't know what you'd call the Tubes.","Onstage, I am a devil. But I'm hardly a social reject.","We were disliked by the press in the early days because they couldn't put their finger on us, and that was the case with Zeppelin as well.","One night Roger was in a foul mood and he threw his entire bloody drumset across the stage. The thing only just missed me - I might have been killed.","But, you know, we spent two years putting our act together.","Back in the old days, we were often compared to Led Zeppelin. If we did something with harmony, it was the Beach Hoys. Something heavy was Led Zeppelin.","I think my melodies are superior to my lyrics.","I'm not into business at all.","We're a bit flashy, but the music's not one big noise.","We've gone overboard on every Queen album. But that's Queen.","I got my diploma from Ealing College of Art, in graphics and illustration."],"Freddie Prinze, Jr.":["Personally, when things upset me, I get quiet and closed off. I have nothing to say, and a chill sets in while I think about what's going on.","Living life at a young age is like being a sponge thrust into the ocean. You absorb what's around you. If you're around people who are supportive and positive, that's how you look at the world.","My old man taught me a lot of stuff in his death that I don't even know if he would have been able to teach me had he been alive. And that was to never do stuff that can jeopardize the people you love and hurt them.","I played Little League. I was a 'pitcher.' But we had a pitching machine, so I was just basically an 'in-infield' shortstop because all I got to do was field bloopers six feet from the plate. I couldn't hit, so that was pretty much my entire job.","Life is not about making dough or how many movies you can make in a year. It's about finding someone that you can share things with.","I know how to create and make people feel something. Honestly, if I didn't do this, I would just have some minimum-wage job in New Mexico, and I would go out on the weekends and make just enough money to pay my insurance and pay for a couple beers, and that would be it.","One person who has taught me a lot and inspired me a lot was Peter Falk. I was fortunate enough to have worked with him in this movie called 'Vig.' He brought my work to a place where it literally shouldn't have been for another two or three years.","I'm a full-time dad; I'm a part-time actor.","When I was in school I read a lot of comic books and pretend I was in them and kids would tease me and call me names. But now I do the same things and people say that I'm artistic and cool and I'm doing the exact same thing I did in high school.","I was raised to believe in myself. I know I'm cool. I'm not trying to brag or say I'm the man or anything like that. I don't lie or cheat, and I'm not mean to anybody. I treat people with respect.","I grew up all over the place, but the majority of my years were spent in Albuquerque, New Mexico.","Speaking Spanish isn't a benefit in Hollywood.","Shooting in Brooklyn is like opening a time capsule. Nothing has changed. Everything looks like it did in the eighties.","I really fight hard to make things film where they're supposed to be filmed. If something is supposed to be in New York, then it has to be in New York.","I've heard, 'May the Force be with you' about as many times as, 'Hey, how you doing?'","I don't know if acting is genetic. Maybe it's environmental.","A couple of years ago, right before I made 'Down to You,' there was a moment when I questioned what I was doing and if it meant anything. I felt like I wasn't accomplishing anything, that the goals I'd set were silly goals. Finally, I realized I just loved acting. It was a very clear moment, and my whole life changed then.","I think success shows a person's true colors.","I would have loved to have played Spider-Man.","I don't really read magazines that much. I read comic books.","I really don't like hurting people; I like making people feel good.","High school's like another planet.","My god-father, Bob Wall, was in a couple of Bruce Lee movies, and he trained Bruce Lee when he came to America.","It's so easy to be selfish in your 20s and not want to sacrifice.","I always appreciated that connection between a parent and a kid because I yearned for it so much. Growing up, I wanted a father, and because I've had this idea of what a father should be, it's exciting to finally have the opportunity to try and be that guy, to see if I can actually do it.","I know throughout my childhood, there were many times I couldn't stand being a 'Jr.' I wouldn't want anybody else to go through that. If we'd had a boy, he wouldn't have been another Freddie Prinze.","The Latinos were doing the five-name thing long before celebrities made it cool. We've been doing things like Antonio Ricardo Luis Raoul Hector Rivera for a while now.","I did '24;' it was terrible. I hated every moment of it.","It only takes 30 seconds to pluck my eyebrows, but it hurts. I have to tweeze 'em in the middle once a week. Otherwise, I look like Bert from 'Sesame Street.'","Tap dancing is something I love, and I've been working on it to get really good.","I love food, man! If it doesn't eat me first, I'll pretty much eat it.","A car just gets me from A to B. I really don't spend that much time driving.","The first thing I did when my career started moving was to buy a small house.","My first job was four words in 'Family Matters.' It was huge!","People don't think I can construct a sentence, let alone write a script.","I follow my heart in almost every instance, and it gets me in trouble most of the time. But I don't care. I think that's the best way I can live.","I was just after Generation X. I missed the John Hughes movies; I had to watch them on TBS.","Girls in L.A. don't eat anything! I'll say, 'You look hungry. I'm not kissing you till you're full because I'm afraid you're going to bite my lip.'","People who have seen my movies don't look at me like an idol. They just give me a lot of love and respect.","I really don't go to any parties.","I just want people to recognize my father as an artist who was way ahead of his time. He was a genius. His life just burnt out quicker than it should have. And that is unfortunate, but what is more unfortunate is that everybody focuses on the nature of his death as opposed to the nature of his life, which was so much greater and more important.","When I was a kid, 'Star Wars' was it. Like, it's in your DNA. I'm old enough to have seen the original one.","I've never seen 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'","I don't know what my daughter will become.","I didn't see 'Star Wars' in theaters until George Lucas re-tweaked it.","When I was a kid, everybody loved Hulk Hogan, right? 'Eat your vitamins. Eat your vegetables.' Everybody over 25 hated him because he was corny, right?","The '80s were all about 'Saturday Night's Main Event.'","When I was in high school. I was considered really weird and strange, and people kind of kept their distance."],"Freddie Prinze":["I must end it. There is no hope. I will be at peace. No one had anything to do with it. My decision totally.","I couldn't fight, and I wasn't particularly interested in the academic. So I started doing satiric bits in the school bathroom. Guys would cut class to come and see me.","I was mugged when I was 12. I had a portable radio, and I ran into this building and these two guys came in and hit me, busted me up and took the radio. After that I was very paranoid and I started taking kung fu and karate. But I didn't want to fight.","When I was little I was always getting hit. Kids would take my hat and throw it around, and it upset me. So I got to be very revengeful.","In fourth grade I had a high school reading level, but I didn't want to go to school and I didn't feel I belonged there.","I was in seventh grade at St. Matthew's. The teachers would tell me, 'God loves you,' and then whack a ruler across my hand. 'Well,' I'd say, 'if God loves me, can you call God? Can you ask Him if it's all right that I didn't do my homework? If it's not, then let Him hit me.'","But the only comparison that I want to Lenny Bruce is that I'm funny. I'm Freddie Prinze, Puerto Rican all the way."],"Freddie Stroma":["I think it's really important for your mental health to think about the big questions, to discuss them and open your mind, in order to prepare you for both life and death.","Americans always ask how much I love my accent, and I don't get that - I think I sound like a school teacher.","Education has always been very important to me.","I left Facebook after Facebook groups began appearing about me and suddenly your personal photographs start becoming public property.","If my dramatic career doesn't work out, I will go on to research and find cures for Alzheimer's or Parkinson's and other motor neuron diseases. It's a very exciting field of research. But I'd like to continue in drama, so it wouldn't be very smart of me if I blew this amazing opportunity with an inappropriate lifestyle.","I would most like to do film or TV. Possibly theatre in the future, but I'm in L.A. a lot of the time at the moment and if I was going to do theatre it would be in London.","I really enjoyed my degree, for me it was the best course you can do. To be able to study the brain and nervous system and the mind with a scientific approach is just incredible! Its philosophical, psychological and biological, three very interesting areas to me.","What attracted me to acting, from the start, was playing different characters. I'm not a massive fan of just playing myself on screen.","If you can play lots of different characters, that's fun. As long as the material is good, that's what the attraction is for me.","It was fun playing a horrible, snotty kid in 'Harry Potter', and then playing Prince Charming where I was also singing and playing guitar, and then playing a completely different character.","There are plenty of actors who've caught the singing bug and vice versa, but with musical performers, you're constantly a persona - which is something I love about acting: you play a character, you leave and you get to be yourself again.","In England, I suppose I have been known to once or twice tune into 'Big Brother', which is a pretty terrible guilty pleasure.","Acting. It's the number one thing I love to do. That's why when people ask me what else I'd love to do, I have no answer - this is all I ever wanted to do.","I've got a pretty close bond with everyone in my family. I've got a brother and a sister whom I'm very close to, and my parents have always been the world's best parents.","I never remember my dreams."],"Freddie Wong":["Gamer humor ranges all over the place. What it comes down to is taking a lot of what we see in gaming and we're familiar with in gaming and being like, 'OK, hold on, let's re-examine this for a second. Isn't this funny? Isn't this strange? Isn't this a little bit ridiculous?' That's where it is.","Straight-up digital delivery will be the way the future works.","There's a lot of history here. In terms of Asians in this country, you have a big influx after the Cultural Revolution, a big influx after the Korean War, a big influx after the Vietnam War.","YouTube is the place where people go to consume advertisements willingly. It's some capitalist dystopian nightmare.","A lot of people have difficulty wrapping their heads around what VR is good for. And the direction people go first is wrong. The wrong place is always: How can we do something we've done before, but on this?","Defying genre conventions is instantly a risky move.","Content financing is a difficult beast no matter what era of Hollywood we're talking about.","I think some people have a vague idea, but the general public has no clue what the actual behind-the-scenes of filmmaking is and what this profession is.","I want to see more people push what it means to be a web show... because it's very difficult to make a living making those types of shows.","While it's easy to sit back and cherry pick bad visual effects and blame the industry for making movies the way they are, you're really not seeing the whole picture.","Great visual effects serve story and character and in doing so, are, by their very definition, invisible.","Everyone talks about, 'Get your foot in the door,' but I never understood that mentality. Why would I want to go in that house? Why not build my own house? Why not take a chair and smash a window?","Drift racing is expensive.","I'm not even very good at most video games.","Non-studio entities can experiment with storytelling that might be too niche... for a studio.","As you reach more people, there is a potential to make a living with what you are creating, and that's the goal.","Online is another way for all of us to reach people.","Film gives us the luxury of deciding where the viewpoint of the audience is, and by knowing that, we can very effectively design around what is actually seen on camera.","Shooting on location and dressing locations in Los Angeles is shockingly expensive, especially when you're talking about webseries-level budgets, so the opportunity to build our sets in YouTube's space gives us a lot more room in our budget in being able to create the world of 'VGHS' properly.","YouTube's a funny place because so many creators fall into their aesthetics out of necessity and the visuals are driven out of an urge to create. You get a lot of interesting examples of interesting design choices that have roots in practicality as well as an artistic sentiment.","Thanks to Netflix and Hulu, people are getting more and more used to consuming longer stretches of content on their televisions or computer screens.","People predicted in the 1910s that live theater was going to be all gone and that we'd just be watching movies. No, live theater is still around, because it does things that are specific to it.","VR has a whole range of things it's very good at, and there's a lot of things that it's going to be deficient at.","If you can't answer the question 'What is VR adding to that experience?' - and it should be more than just a gee-whiz thing - then that project shouldn't be in VR. You're not taking full advantage of your medium.","I get occasional tweets from people asking what shampoo and conditioner I use. I go straight for the Costco brand, Kirkland brand, the bulk shampoo. That's as far as I go.","The Asian male has an interesting history as far as Western appropriation. At one point, we were completely sexless Chinamen building the railroads. Then, World War II came around, and it was like, Asian guys are coming after the white women. We became a menace for a second.","One of our goals is to figure out ways of diversifying where we are.","Venture capitalists don't pay attention to you unless you have an app or a widget.","The goal is not to just do 'Video Game High School' every year. We want to grow into a real content production company. We want to be Pixar or HBO. We want to make five series a year or 10 series a year.","At the end of the day, we still make the things that we make. And we found that the best strategy in this very fluid marketplace is to not be tied into any given platform, but to be able to make good content, and good content will be able to live anywhere.","When we started out doing YouTube videos, I think we were very, very early on in terms of people doing a behind-the-scenes component.","From a creative perspective, we've been very fortunate in that doing it the 'VGHS' way gave us unlimited freedom. Whatever we wanted to do, however we wanted to do it, we had that.","Five years is a very long time. If you think about it in terms of just people's lives, in terms of who our audience is: if you were in high school when you first saw our stuff, you're in college now.","We want to be a studio that makes a whole bunch of stuff we believe in, in all ranges of scale and time and length, and own as much as that IP ourselves and generate as much of that IP ourselves as possible.","If it doesn't feel organic to the audience, you gotta trust your gut.","A better quality of video is better for everyone.","We don't believe in competition.","I don't think a lot of people really know what goes into something that they see.","A vlog look is a very specific look, and it's basically a phone look.","We're able to push the envelope with what we're doing, both on a technical and artistic level, which is the most that any filmmaker can ask for.","We take a lot of pictures with fans, and when they walk away, their parents say, 'Who was that?'","I think if you make good, interesting content with compelling story lines and good characters, people will tune into the web for as long as you want them to.","Views online is a real weird and sticky subject. One view on a 30-second piece of content is not equivalent to one view on a 30 minute video. In my mind it's not quite the same thing.","The consumer is the absolute king in everything you do.","Hollywood is just a bunch of middlemen, people trying to facilitate content transfer between creators and viewers.","I don't think any reasonable person would object to you, as the advertiser, having say in who and what you want to pair your ad with.","A user who essentially costs YouTube money has very little say. The way to have a say is to concretely support the creators and channels you watch directly by giving them money.","Deep engagement is much more powerful and valuable than fleeting mass market engagement.","On the advertising side, view count is not the most important thing. It's engagement.","The moment you've brought a toothbrush to work, then you're getting into crunch time.","When we think about a great movie, I mean, what do we think about? We think about story, we think about character. And when the visual effects aren't perfect, we forgive it.","I have to credit high school for allowing us to mess around with movie stuff at a time when it was a novelty. Experimenting with that and having a very good group of friends to work with made it a very easy decision that this seemed like something I wanted to do with the rest of my life.","When we started doing YouTube, the goal was, hey, let's make stuff that we want to see, that entertains us.","We have an audience, the ability to fund our own projects, own our own projects, the ability to display our projects unencumbered by any middlemen. That's the perfect scenario.","We firmly believe the future of television is online, and Hulu has recognized the value of quality long-form series.","We believe that the future for content-creators such as ourselves lies in being able to source project money from an audience and deliver on those projects in a timely and cost-effective manner.","We've always wanted to control the video player for our videos. We really want to evolve how comments on videos work.","We always said that directors work their whole lives to get final cut on a movie. We have that. So why would you want to run away from what every other director is sprinting toward their entire careers?","In general, a lot of content creators find that their success is unable to support any sort of organization of scale. It's pretty difficult to support even three or four employees.","The Lionsgate deal came at an opportune time. It allows us to get our projects financed and create long-form content without needing to be reliant on brand deals or crowdsourcing for external financing.","Hulu understood how much content costs. By remaining defensive, YouTube is losing various aspects of video - long-form, for example - to other companies.","I feel like we cheated... because you read about these other directors, just like, 'Damn! They paid dues for 10 years before they got to get behind the camera.' We cheated because technology was in the right place at the right time, and we were alive at the right age at the right time for us to take advantage of that.","Video content yearns to be free.","You have to figure out some way of making money without relying on video ads or people paying to download.","Visual effects have always been a part of this art form. And CG is simply a tool on the filmmaker's tool belt to tell a story, but when the end result is bad - maybe it's not the tool's fault.","People always ask us, 'When are you guys gonna do a movie? When are you gonna do a TV show?' And to me, that feels like such a step backwards from where are.","We have full creative control, we have a giant audience that loves what we do, and we can make whatever we want.","We are not frou-frou creative types. We have done both sides of the business and are constantly asking ourselves, 'How are we going to pay for this?' But the criteria is that it must fit with our world.","We are video consumers first and foremost, and we hate anything appearing in the videos that isn't organic.","It's hard to sell merchandise off YouTube.","When you have a home and create a brand people believe in and want to support, it makes it easier for you to control merchandise and sell it.","We were looking for representation that was creatively and commercially in synch with our core DNA. The team at WME understands where we're going, and we're looking forward to taking our company to the next level with them by our side.","Kickstarter has shifted from funding creative projects to funding products and videogames; the biggest funded are consumer electronics and video game projects.","We founded RocketJump for two reasons: to provide quality entertainment and to reach as many different audiences as possible.","Youku Tudou gives us the reach into China that we've been looking for, and we look forward to sharing even more content with international audiences in the near future.","It's rare to find a corporate partner who encourages true creativity, but our meetings with Lionsgate's creative team convinced us that this is the right move for RocketJump and our millions of fans."],"Freddy Adu":["All I can say is, hey, if you have fun doing what you do, if you have fun playing soccer, the creativity is just going to come as time goes on.","A lot of people have been hyped up to be great but just disappeared. I promised myself I wouldn't be one of them.","I think everything happens for a reason and all the things that happened to me - good, bad - I'm glad they did. It's made me ready for life, for adulthood.","Obviously, everybody has their own expectations of you, but you have to have your own expectations for yourself. For me, I'm right on track.","I've always been one of the youngest guys on the team. But now I'm one of the older guys, one of the more experienced guys, and I have to be more of a leader. The guys are looking up to me, asking me questions and looking at me to step up.","I just want to go in with the right attitude and from Day 1 make a difference.","I honestly didn't expect this much attention, but it just keeps happening so I must be doing something right.","Nothing has been given to me.","You can't do anything to help your team win when you don't play.","Obviously, I'm at the beginning of my career, contrary to what anyone else thinks. I'm 19 years old. In any other country, everywhere else, you're a prospect. And that's what I am right now in Europe. I'm a prospect. I'm not a seasoned veteran.","When I'm out there on the field, I'm in a whole different world, you know? It's like, I'm just having so much fun.","My mom was always the supplier of soccer balls, and so people were always knocking on my door, and trying to get me out so we could play.","What do I have to cheat for? I've always been playing against people older than me anyways. So what do I have to cheat for?","I wanted to get us a place of our own with a little bit more space. The kitchen is just huge, because my mom... lives there, man, and she loves being in the kitchen.","I couldn't ask for a better life.","I play a lot of Playstation, and always trying to look pretty for the girls.","I need to be in a stable environment right now in my career. What I mean by that is a place where I can play and not have too much pressure on me and a place I can develop. Monaco wanted me and did whatever they could to get me so I feel very very good about that.","I don't know French at all. I took some lessons when I was younger but all I know are the numbers. I've been told basically everyone in Monaco speaks English because of it being a huge vacation spot so I'm excited about that. I might not need to learn French after all.","I need to go play football. I don't care about anything else.","It's frustrating at times when you think you've earned a chance to play on the field and you're over there sitting on the bench. That's not the kind of player I am. I'm the kind of player who wants to be out there on the field and needs to contribute every minute of every game.","It's one of the best leagues in Europe in football. Benfica in my opinion is one of the top 10 biggest clubs in the world.","I'm going to go in and play, because the most important thing is playing on the field and being able to contribute.

He would take me - I had two brothers - and we used to go in the early '80s and check out these grindhouse movies - a double feature, sometimes a triple feature.","I came from the stage so it was a different kind of acting, or a different arena of acting, and I just loved to do it as a kid. It's really gratifying to get to create these different characters and to get to create different voices and to get to wear different clothes.","No, there isn't a particular type of genre that I'm drawn to. I'm more drawn to the possibility of creating different characters, or being able to go from one genre to the other and to show that I could do it, that I could be good at it.","I'm drawn more to quality, and so if the quality is in television, I go in that direction. If it's in film, I go in that direction. But I don't limit myself or discriminate against any of the mediums.","I would absolutely recommend for actors to start in the theater because it establishes a foundation in your craft that you can build off of.","Personally, I need to learn every word on the page before I go in and audition. I have not mastered the skill of holding pages in my hand and acting with pages in my hand.

Get really, really good so that when people say your name, your name is associated with quality, with integrity."],"Frederic Bastiat":["Each of us has a natural right, from God, to defend his person, his liberty, and his property.","The state is the great fictitious entity by which everyone seeks to live at the expense of everyone else.","Everyone wants to live at the expense of the state. They forget that the state wants to live at the expense of everyone.","Life, liberty, and property do not exist because men have made laws. On the contrary, it was the fact that life, liberty, and property existed beforehand that caused men to make laws in the first place.","Often the masses are plundered and do not know it.","Is not liberty the destruction of all despotism - including, of course, legal despotism?","And what is liberty, whose very name makes the heart beat faster and shakes the world?

After one has played a vast quantity of notes and more notes, it is simplicity that emerges as the crowning reward of art.","Oh, how miserable it is to have no one to share your sorrows and joys, and, when your heart is heavy, to have no soul to whom you can pour out your woes.","Vienna is a handsome, lively city, and pleases me exceedingly.","Sometimes I can only groan, and suffer, and pour out my despair at the piano!","I wish I could throw off the thoughts which poison my happiness, but I take a kind of pleasure in indulging them.","I shall create a new world for myself.","As long as I have health and strength, I will gladly work all my days.","Man is never always happy, and very often only a brief period of happiness is granted him in this world; so why escape from this dream which cannot last long?","The crowd intimidates me, its breath suffocates me.

Yet it contains the one thing needful for every human life: the good news of Resurrection.","Easter tells us of something children can't understand, because it addresses things they don't yet have to know: the weariness of life, the pain, the profound loneliness and hovering fear of meaninglessness.","Somehow we just don't make the same boisterous fun of Holy Week that we do of Christmas. No one plans to have a holly, jolly Easter.","God is not looking for repayment, but repentance. What heals a broken relationship is sincere love and contrition.","God's presence is not just Light, and Life, but Love. And Love invites, but does not compel.","The devil's main purpose is not to scare us, in a horror-movie way; when we're scared of him, we're alert to him, and that might undermine his plans. Instead, he wants to quietly, subtly lure us into stepping away from God.","Temptation coaxes us toward sin, and sin leads to sickness and death, and ultimately confinement in the realm of the evil one.","My mother was an unbeliever - and still is. My father was a nominal Catholic. We would go in to church at the last minute before the gospel reading, take Communion, and walk right out again.","Of the seven deadly sins, anger has long been the one with the best box of costumes. When the guy in the next car rages at you, he's dangerous. When you rage at him, you're just. We can usually recognize the results of anger, especially in others, as destructive and evil.","What's wrong with us isn't a rap sheet of bad deeds, but a damaged heart, a soul-sickness, that plunges us into fearful self-protection, alienation from God and others.","I've been able to dig deeper into awareness of my own sinfulness, and take baby steps toward spiritual healing. I'm able to worship in an ancient communion full of awesome beauty, one that is now being blessed with quiet revival.","There are lots of things to like about being Eastern Orthodox - incense, liturgies, all the baklava you can eat - but you know what I like best? None of that stupid 'women's ministry' stuff.","I was raised in a nominal Roman Catholic home, but without any really strong faith there.","As a teenager and a student, I totally cast away the Christian faith. I just believed it was stupid, and only stupid people could believe it. I actually became an anti-Christian, and very antagonistic.","After I graduated from college, while traveling around Europe, hitchhiking, doing the tourist thing, I went into a church in Dublin.","The Christmas story has such power and such appeal every year. There are other stories we get tired of. You think of your favorite movie; you don't want to watch it 15 times.","Jesus showed us how to be courageous and sacrificial while we die for our beliefs, not while we kill for them.","People don't do theology in a vacuum but in a community with other theological thinkers, where there's jealousy, vanity, hurt pride, all those things.","You can latch onto theological ideas that are, in fact, not accurate, and refuse to let them go. I think we've seen this a few times in church history.","The Church is the safe place to be. I can safely believe everything the Church teaches. It will not harm me, and in fact it will equip me to grow and grow and have a better and better ability to experience that direct presence.","I know by experience that Jesus Christ is a very powerful spirit - I know by experience that he is probably the most powerful spirit in the universe. I know by experience he is not a mere human being. He is something beyond that.","The Church's teaching isn't an official statement, but the cumulative understanding of all the people who have loved and experienced Jesus through time.","I think intellectualizing annoys me because it is the enemy of experience; you cannot experience the presence of God and analyze it at the same time. You can't analyze anything and experience it simultaneously.","The Orthodox hierarchy doesn't have the kind of power that high-ranking clergy do in other churches. There isn't even a worldwide governing board to hold all the various Orthodox bodies together.","Someone who wanted to challenge Orthodoxy would not be able to locate a building to hold a protest march in front of. The faith is too diffused.","Lots of Orthodox go to church every Sunday but don't know much about the faith. Yet they know that there is something that they don't know much about.","The New Testament Scriptures are full of references to the malice of the devil, but we generally overlook them. I think this is because our idea of salvation is that Christ died on the cross to pay His Father the debt for our sins.","Women and men just aren't that different. Oh, we're different in some intriguing ways, and it can be fun to band together for all-gal or all-guy projects. But when it comes to the tragic mess Christ came to heal, we're pretty much the same.","Women don't need to have our own little corner of the church where we can feel precious or, alternatively, cranky. In every essential thing, as far as life in Christ is concerned, the differences between men and women are irrelevant.","A segregated spiritual subculture does women no good, even if it does have adorable butterflies in the logo.","It is tragic that some Christians have been so battered with stories of a prideful, vindictive God that they have fled from Jesus' fold.","The Bible, that powerful book, has many effects: it comforts, counsels, instructs, and brings us into the presence of God. But trying to erase offense as one of its functions is a fundamentally misguided task."],"Frederick Banting":["Insulin is not a cure for diabetes; it is a treatment. It enables the diabetic to burn sufficient carbohydrates so that proteins and fats may be added to the diet in sufficient quantities to provide energy for the economic burdens of life.","I lived in constant terror of being asked a question in class. Even if I knew the answer, I was never able to tell it before the class.","Diabetes mellitus is due to a deficiency of the internal secretion of the pancreas. The main principle of treatment is, therefore, to correct this deficiency.","Especially during the hot weather, we have been so greatly hampered by infections despite our utmost care, and since we have lost so many dogs, I strongly desire more help to keep the place clean and gloves and gowns and a thorough fitting up of our operating room.","In the U.S., the incidence of diabetes has increased proportionately with the per capita consumption of sugar.","In the past, war was confined for the most part to men in uniform, but with increased mechanization of armies and the introduction of air forces, there is an increased dependence on the home country, and eight to ten people working at home are now required to keep one man in the fighting line.","Best said possibly the only thing that would have changed my attitude: 'What will happen to me?' 'Your friend MacLeod will look after you,' I said. Best replied, 'If you get out, I get out.' There was silence for some moments. I thought of all the joy of the early experiments which we had known together. Here was loyalty.","It was because of Henderson that I stayed... It was he and he alone who kept me in Toronto and in Canada. Were it not for Henderson, I believe insulin would have been a product of the United States.","The method of estimating the potency of insulin solutions is based on the effect that insulin produces upon the blood sugar of normal animals.","During the first couple of years at school... I used to take my lunch and go down by the old fair grounds & sit alone by the side of the road & eat it... Those lovely, lonely lunches stick deep in my memory as unhappy times.","I very deeply appreciate the honour which you have conferred upon me in awarding the Nobel Prize for 1923 to me and Professor J.J.R. Macleod.","Father was very sympathetic, and if the hero of a romance was good or to be pitied, his eyes would fill with tears until he could not see.","If a patient became sugar-free and blood sugar normal on a basal requirement diet, the caloric intake was gradually increased until sugar appeared in the urine. The tolerance was thus ascertained.","I had been taught that if I cried, to be quiet about it, so whereas I never howled, the least thing made me cry both at school and at home. Crying tends to separate a child from other children, for even children dislike a cry baby, and I had no friends in the world.","My work is entirely surgical, and Col. Starr has given me a very interesting task of collecting nerve cases that have had the nerves sewn together. I may also do some experimental work for him.","I looked at one little print for a long time. It was called 'The Landing.' It showed men tugging on a rope, pulling a boat up onto skids out of the water. The thought occurred to me that I might paint such a picture.","When I go in, I find that it is not a lab but an office. There are a pile of letters to answer, phone numbers to call up, people waiting to have an interview, routine work that must be done.","British Forces should be in a position to give back in a ten fold measure any attack that the Germans may attempt.","The place where we were operating was not fit to be called an operating room. Aseptic work had not been done in it for some years. The floor could not be scrubbed properly, or the water would go through on the laboratories below.","Mr. Best has expressed the desire to work with me, and I should be more than pleased to have him. His work has been excellent, and he is absolutely honest, careful, and impartial and has taken a great interest in the work.","Henderson had a thousand times more to do with the discovery of insulin than had Macleod. In the first place, he knew more about it. In the second place, he was consulted before every series of experiments, and he advised, criticized, or commended.","Professor Macleod, in his remarks, gave everything that I was going to say and used the pronoun 'we' throughout. The following day, students were talking about the remarkable work of Professor Macleod.","On February 19th, Dr. Collip found that he was unable to refine the extract by his method and was unable to keep up his supply to the wards. During the following six weeks, or longer, no extract was available for clinical tests. I believe the reason for this to be that Collip, wishing to keep his process a secret, had not kept careful records.","It was an extremely trying time for me. Best was still intimate with MacLeod and the others about the laboratory. I was out of the picture entirely. MacLeod had taken over the whole physiological investigation. Collip had taken over the biochemistry. Professor Graham and Dr. Campbell had taken over the whole clinical aspect of the investigation.","Best and I worked in the sub-basement of the old medical building day and night. Time, meals, sleep - all were of secondary consideration. We had to get insulin into a form that was refined enough for continued clinical use."],"Frederick Buechner":["If it seems a childish thing to do, do it in remembrance that you are a child.","Religion points to that area of human experience where in one way or another man comes upon mystery as a summons to pilgrimage.","In his holy flirtation with the world, God occasionally drops a handkerchief. These handkerchiefs are called saints.","The grace of God means something like: Here is your life. You might never have been, but you are because the party wouldn't have been complete without you.","It is as impossible for man to demonstrate the existence of God as it would be for even Sherlock Holmes to demonstrate the existence of Arthur Conan Doyle.","Compassion is sometimes the fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It is the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too.","Pay mind to your own life, your own health, and wholeness.

Although not a scientist herself she has contributed more to my work than anyone else by providing a peaceful and happy home.","I believe that we have been doing this not primarily to achieve riches or even honour, but rather because we were interested in the work, enjoyed doing it and felt very strongly that it was worthwhile."],"Frederick Scott Oliver":["No politician has ever yet been able to rule his country, nor has any country ever yet been able to face the world, upon the principles of the Sermon on the Mount.","Men who are engaged in public life must necessarily aim at reducing opposition to a minimum, and one of the most obvious means to that end is by misrepresenting, discrediting or ruining their opponents.","It is true that the politician, in his professional character, does not always, or even very often, conform to the most approved pattern of private conduct."],"Frederick Soddy":["The pure air and dazzling snow belong to things beyond the reach of all personal feeling, almost beyond the reach of life. Yet such things are a part of our life, neither the least noble nor the most terrible.","Nature is in austere mood, even terrifying, withal majestically beautiful.","Chemistry has been termed by the physicist as the messy part of physics, but that is no reason why the physicists should be permitted to make a mess of chemistry when they invade it.","Now whatever the origin of this apparently meaningless jumble of ideas may have been, it is really a perfect and very slightly allegorical expression of the actual present views we hold today.","On our plane knowledge and ignorance are the immemorial adversaries.","An honest money system is the only alternative.","But what sin is to the moralist and crime to the jurist so to the scientific man is ignorance.","In the first place, the preparation of the Nobel lecture which I am to give has shown me, even more clearly than I knew before, how many others share with me, often, indeed, have anticipated me, in the discoveries for which you have awarded me the prize.","It is curious to reflect, for example, upon the remarkable legend of the Philosopher's Stone, one of the oldest and most universal beliefs, the origin of which, however far back we penetrate into the records of the past, we do not probably trace its real source.","Man cannot influence in this respect the atomic forces of Nature.","Scientific men can hardly escape the charge of ignorance with regard to the precise effect of the impact of modern science upon the mode of living of the people and upon their civilisation.","The whole profit of the issuance of money has provided the capital of the great banking business as it exists today.","There is nothing left now for us but to get ever deeper and deeper into debt to the banking system in order to provide the increasing amounts of money the nation requires for its expansion and growth.","There is something sublime about its aloofness from and its indifference to its external environment.","To-day it appears as though it may well be altogether abolished in the future as it has to some extent been mitigated in the past by the unceasing, and as it now appears, unlimited ascent of man to knowledge, and through knowledge to physical power and dominion over Nature.","With all our mastery over the powers of Nature we have adhered to the view that the struggle for existence is a permanent and necessary condition of life."],"Frederick Tennyson":["Softly the loud peal dies, In passing winds it drowns, But breathes, like perfect joys, Tender tones.","What would it profit thee to be the first Of echoes, tho thy tongue should live forever, A thing that answers, but hath not a thought As lasting but as senseless as a stone."],"Frederick W. Smith":["Leadership is simply the ability of an individual to coalesce the efforts of other individuals toward achieving common goals. It boils down to looking after your people and ensuring that, from top to bottom, everyone feels part of the team.","A manager is not a person who can do the work better than his men; he is a person who can get his men to do the work better than he can.","Information about the package is as important as the package itself.","Every time we make an investment decision at FedEx, we ask ourselves: 'What is the return on this investment?'","A Yale University management professor in response to student Fred Smith's paper proposing reliable overnight delivery service: The concept is interesting and well-formed, but in order to earn better than a 'C', the idea must be feasible.","There is no free market for oil. It's controlled by a cartel, OPEC.","Leaders get out in front and stay there by raising the standards by which they judge themselves - and by which they are willing to be judged.","Fear of failure must never be a reason not to try something.","I'm not afraid to take a swing and miss.","If you look historically, what creates growth and wealth is innovation and investment, and increase in scale - more customers.","My four years in the Marine Corps left me with an indelible understanding of the value of leadership skills.","My innovation involved taking an idea from the telecommunications and banking industries, and applying that idea to transportation business.","I am not someone who tends to advocate for increased government involvement in the private sector.","Beginning in 1973 and then acts in '77, '78, 1980, 1994 and then into the 21st century in the international arena, governments have steadily gotten out of the transportation business.","I do not believe I could have built FedEx without the skills I learned from the Marine Corps.","The biggest part of our business has always been moving things, not paper. With the Internet, people in Mississippi can buy things from Macedonia, without regard to time or place or quantity.","A lot of the economy is indeed being supplied by goods that are produced offshore. And much of the reason for that is societal.","Only electricity can give the transport sector the flexibility to switch fuels when one or more become too expensive.","The tax rate of 35 percent is impossible to provide an incentive to the large corporations, that have $1.7 trillion offshore, to put their money back in the United States.","The United States tax system today is very prejudiced towards financialization, leverage, and lack of investment."],"Frederick W.

How often have we ourselves been made happy by kind words, in a manner and to an extent which we are unable to explain!","Kind thoughts are rarer than either kind words or deeds. They imply a great deal of thinking about others. This in itself is rare. But they also imply a great deal of thinking about others without the thoughts being criticisms. This is rarer still.","Kind words are the music of the world. They have a power which seems to be beyond natural causes, as if they were some angel's song, which had lost its way and come on Earth, and sang on undyingly, smiting the hearts of men with sweetest wounds, and putting for the while an angel's nature into us.","Happiness is a great power of holiness. Thus, kind words, by their power of producing happiness, have also a power of producing holiness, and so of winning men to God.","Many a friendship, long, loyal, and self-sacrificing, rested at first on no thicker a foundation than a kind word.","Kindness has converted more sinners than zeal, eloquence, or learning.","They always win who side with God.","The buried talent is the sunken rock on which most lives strike and founder.","If I may use such a word when I am speaking of religious subjects, it is by voice and words that men 'mesmerize' each other. Hence it is that the world is converted by the voice of the preacher.","It has always seemed to me that a love of natural objects, and the depth, as well as exuberance and refinement of mind, produced by an intelligent delight in scenery, are elements of the first importance in the education of the young."],"Frederick William Robertson":["There are three things in the world that deserve no mercy, hypocrisy, fraud, and tyranny.","Instruction ends in the schoolroom, but education ends only with life. A child is given to the universe to be educated.","We win by tenderness.

No work truly done, no word earnestly spoken, no sacrifice freely made, was ever made in vain.","It is not the situation that makes the man, but the man who makes the situation.","No one can be great, or good, or happy except through the inward efforts of themselves.","The true aim of everyone who aspires to be a teacher should be, not to impart his own opinions, but to kindle minds.","Pray till prayer makes you forget your own wish, and leave it or merge it in God's will.","Men... are bettered and improved by trial, and refined out of broken hopes and blighted expectations.","Two thousand years ago there was One here on this earth who lived the grandest life that ever has been lived yet - a life that every thinking man, with deeper or shallower meaning, has agreed to call divine.","The office of poetry is not to make us think accurately, but feel truly.","Only so far as a man believes strongly, mightily, can he act cheerfully, or do anything that is worth doing.","Love is not a union merely between two creatures, it is a union between two spirits.","To turn water into wine, and what is common into what is holy, is indeed the glory of Christianity.","The humblest occupation has in it materials of discipline for the highest heaven.","The Divine wisdom has given us prayer, not as a means whereby to obtain the good things of earth, but as a means whereby we learn to do without them; not as a means whereby we escape evil, but as a means whereby we become strong to meet it.","A silent man is easily reputed wise. A man who suffers none to see him in the common jostle and undress of life, easily gathers round him a mysterious veil of unknown sanctity, and men honor him for a saint.

You have to organize your thoughts.","Anybody whose mind is functioning at all can't be content with the way the world works.","I don't like to read novels where the novelist tells me what to think about the situation and the characters.

The answer is, I never do any research.","Stories where the author has known very little, but run a computer program that tells him how to construct a planet, and looked up specific things about rocketry and so on, really suck.","If you don't care about science enough to be interested in it on its own, you shouldn't try to write hard science fiction. You can write like Ray Bradbury and Harlan Ellison as much as you want.","I don't think the scientific method and the science fictional method are really analogous. The thing about them is that neither is really practiced very much, at least not consciously. But the fact that they are methodical does relate them.","I'm doing a book, 'Chasing Science,' about the pleasures of science as a spectator sport.","It's clear that science and science fiction have overlapping populations.","Stephen Hawking said he spent most of his first couple of years at Cambridge reading science fiction (and I believe that, because his grades weren't all that great).","A lot of the cosmologists and astrophysicists clearly had been reading science fiction.","The head of Fermilab was reading Astonishing Stories when he was ten.","A large fraction of the most interesting scientists have read a lot of SF at one time or another, either early enough that it may have played a part in their becoming scientists or at some later date just because they liked the ideas.","My old English buddy, John Rackham, wrote and told me what made science fiction different from all other kinds of literature - science fiction is written according to the science fiction method.","You look at the world around you, and you take it apart into all its components. Then you take some of those components, throw them away, and plug in different ones, start it up and see what happens.","That's the method: restructure the world we live in in some way, then see what happens.","In terms of stories I would buy for a science fiction magazine, if they take place in the future, that might do it.","I'm pretty catholic about what constitutes science fiction.","I was thinking of writing a little foreword saying that history is, after all, based on people's recollections, which change with time.","The big new development in my life is, when I turned 80, I decided I no longer have to do four pages a day.

The US thinks it is, and wants you to agree; and, moreover, to consider US interests as being universal ones.","Often, these downplay the power of cultural imperialism - in that sense, playing the game of US interests - by reassuring us that the global success of American mass culture is not as bad as all that.","In most of the European countries - France stands out in its resistance to this particular form of American cultural imperialism - the national film industries were forced onto the defensive after the war by such binding agreements.","If it is, in reality, capitalism that is the motor force behind the destructive forms of globalization, then it must be in their capacity to neutralize or transform this particular mode of exploitation that one can best test these various forms of resistance to the West.","A further point is that, little by little, in the current universe, everything is slowly being named; nor does this have anything to do with the older Aristotelian universals in which the idea of a chair subsumes all its individual manifestations."],"Fredric March":["Keep interested in others; keep interested in the wide and wonderful world. Then in a spiritual sense you will always be young.","An actor has no more right to be temperamental than a bank clerk.","I liked the name Frederick Bickel and I wish now I had left it as it was. After all, Theodore Bikel, whose name was similar though spelled differently, didn't change his, and he did all right.","Stardom is just an uneasy seat on top of a tricky toboggan. Being a star is merely perching at the head of the downgrade. A competent featured player can last a lifetime. A star, a year or two. There's all that agony of finding suitable stories, keeping in character, maintaining illusion.","It has been my experience that work on the screen clarifies stage portrayals and vice versa.

That is why people assemble: to hear different opinions, rather than to pass resolutions.","I would rather propose a bureau somewhat similar to that which we have in the Universal Postal Union.","Indeed, whenever a new idea is developed, as for example ballooning, warfare immediately takes possession.","On the other hand, the waging of peace as a science, as an art, is in its infancy. But we can trace its growth, its steady progress, and the time will come when there will be particular individuals designated to assume responsibility for and leadership of this movement.","Peace congresses often start by dealing with some of the less important questions in excessive detail, so at the end there is no time to discuss the most important problems.","The interparliamentary conference should, in my opinion, direct its particular attention to the preparation of the next Hague Conference, the diplomatic conference, the conference of governments.","Today's date, the eighteenth of May, should sometime become an occasion of great international celebration, for on this day ten years ago the first Peace Conference opened at The Hague.","Waging war we understand, but not waging peace, or at any rate less consciously so.","A sign that a peace association is going adrift is its exclusion of other political parties, with whom it could collaborate effectively on most of the problems besetting the cause of peace.","As a result of my study, I came to the conclusion that a common supreme authority was undesirable.","But I feel convinced, and I venture even to prophesy in this regard, that the time will come when there will also be a minister of peace in the cabinet, seated beside the ministers of war.","I would have thought it possible to choose delegates for these larger conferences who, even if they could not speak the principal languages, could at least understand them or could have friends seated beside them who could keep them informed on essential points.","It has since been agreed that speeches given in English will be translated into French and vice versa, and even into German and Italian when necessary. No doubt translations into Esperanto will also soon be in demand.","Naturally, business and pleasure can be readily combined, but a certain balance should exist, and the latter should not predominate over the former.","Nevertheless, this type of propaganda has a special value, for it serves to convince those who sign the appeal, of the necessity for carrying on propaganda; so a corps of propagandists, if I may use the term, is thus trained.","Indeed; peace literature is almost exclusively read, though to good effect, by pacifists, while what is needed is the canvassing of those who have not so far been won to the cause.","The last Hague Conference has in the meantime expressed its opinion that a body should be established which could prepare for the work involved more effectively than has hitherto proved possible.","There are in most states one or two ministers of war, one of whom is the minister of naval affairs.","There are many members of parliament present here who know as well as I do that, if a man has not already been converted, it will require a great deal more than a letter of appeal to achieve conversion.","There are those who believe we have need of more literature, of a large international publishing house, of a great peace newspaper, or the like. I am rather skeptical about this idea.","There is one criticism which cannot be leveled at interparliamentary conferences but which is applicable to a great extent to peace congresses: the meetings waste time.","This is the task, I think, of a letter movement. But it should be set up only in states where a significant response can be achieved, for a letter movement necessarily presupposes a strong organization.","To read the report of a discussion in which arguments for and against are presented, in which a subject has been covered from different points of view, with new ideas advanced - this is far more instructive than to read a brief account of the resolution passed on the matter.","Warfare has been marvelously developed. It will soon be impossible to raise it to further heights.","We have had such a letter movement on two occasions in Denmark when more than a quarter of the adult Danish population participated.

After the gift of life it is perhaps the greatest of God's gifts. It is the mother of civilizations, of arts and of sciences.","Unfortunately the global warming hysteria, as I see it, is driven by politics more than by science.","The public knows that human beings are fallible. Only people blinded by ideology fall into the trap of believing in their own infallibility.","The marketplace judges technologies by their practical effectiveness, by whether they succeed or fail to do the job they are designed to do.","The PhD system is the real root of the evil of academic snobbery. People who have PhDs consider themselves a priesthood, and inventors generally don't have PhDs.","I'm a mathematician, basically.

John Randall wasn't a great scientist, but he was a great inventor. There's been lots more like him, and it's a shame they don't get Nobel Prizes.","We have no reason to think that climate change is harmful if you look at the world as a whole. Most places, in fact, are better off being warmer than being colder. And historically, the really bad times for the environment and for people have been the cold periods rather than the warm periods.","The fact that the climate is getting warmer doesn't scare me at all. There's no reason why one should be scared.","Just because you see pictures of glaciers falling into the ocean doesn't mean anything bad is happening. This is something that happens all the time. It's part of the natural cycle of things. We know from measurements that glaciers have been melting for 200 years at least.","The technologies that raise the fewest ethical problems are those that work on a human scale, brightening the lives of individual people.","Lucky individuals in each generation find technology appropriate to their needs.","The important thing is that we now have the tools to sequence all kinds of animals and plants and microbes - as well as humans. It is not important that we didn't actually finish the human sequence yet.","I like people who are working on practical things and who are working in teams. It's not so important to get the glory. It's much more important to get something that works. It's a better way to live.","Unfortunately, things are different in climate science because the arguments have become heavily politicised. To say that the dogmas are wrong has become politically incorrect."],"Freeman Thomas":["Good design begins with honesty, asks tough questions, comes from collaboration and from trusting your intuition.","We were promised a simpler life, and technology has only complicated our lives.","We think there's a huge opportunity in smaller vehicles. Smaller vehicles done in an American way."],"Frei Otto":["Most architects think in drawings, or did think in drawings; today, they think on the computer monitor. I always tried to think three dimensionally. The interior eye of the brain should be not flat but three dimensional so that everything is an object in space. We are not living in a two-dimensional world.","I have only one dream. It is the oldest of humanity, of man, in time. It is paradise. I would like to give paradise to everyone.","My architectural drive was to design new types of buildings to help poor people, especially following natural disasters and catastrophes... I will use whatever time is left to me to keep doing what I have been doing, which is to help humanity.","Everything man is doing in architecture is to try to go against nature. Of course we have to understand nature to know how far we have to go against nature. The secret, I think, of the future is not doing too much. All architects have the tendency to do too much.","Buildings are 'humane' only when they promote peaceful human co-existence.","My architecture is the architecture of survival.","We have big, big problems - flooding, earthquake, and many foolish things which now people are doing - I mean, these self-made catastrophes. We are able to give to every man on the street the possibilities to help himself. And to fight for this was one of my duties.","Why should we build very large spaces when they are not necessary? We can design halls spanning several kilometres and covering a whole city, but we have to ask, what does it really make? What does society really need?","My hope is that light, flexible architecture might bring about a new and open society.","I have never been satisfied with a piece of work I have been actively involved in, and would never want to be."],"Freida Pinto":["I'll never forget where I'm from. It's essential to remain humble and evolving.","As the world's getting filled with temptations, we're getting a bit frivolous and a bit fickle.","All people - African, European, American - worry about being different. But I've learned that the traits we'd rush to get rid of are the very ones that others desire. People always covet what they don't have. That's why we should look at ourselves every now and then and say, 'I'm proud of myself. I like the way I'm made.'","I think even the most beautiful person looks stupid on Skype.","A lot of the younger Indian generation are either IT geniuses or doctors - the number of doctors I've seen in L.A. who are Indian is just crazy. So it is a very common thing. Or an accountant! That again is a very, very big thing.","I definitely need to date someone who is calm.","I keep saying I'm not at all famous in my own country, because people do not think I have done anything for India.","I did not particularly enjoy modeling. I felt I was only utilizing 10 or 20 percent of my abilities. In India, it's just another job.","I always imagined that I would learn something each time that I would take to a new project, then I realized that each new project poses a completely different challenge.","I guess confidence is the only thing that I take from project to project, but I'm always open to learning everybody's style - the director, the actor I'm working with.","I tell you why I like Chanel so much: when I started off, no one wanted to give me clothes to wear. Absolutely no one! All the labels said, 'Who is she?' But Chanel believed in me from the very beginning.","I've learned to develop a thick skin, but you're bound to be affected when you read something bad about yourself in the paper and it's rubbed in your face over and over.","When a doctor is performing an operation, his mind cannot be somewhere else. And it's the same with actors. You have to commit yourself mind, body and soul to a project in order to do justice to it.","I'm glad I'm a strong person.","I feel like the history between Israel and Palestine has a lot in common with the history between India and Pakistan.","Anybody, anywhere in the world, all they want is to be free, to choose what they want to do without having someone tell them how to do it.","There's one disturbing notion throughout India that light skin is more attractive than dark.","When you doubt one thing about yourself, you start thinking there's also something wrong with your hair, your body, your clothes, your accent.","In L.A. you hear all these stories of people being filmed in their own homes through their windows. I think that is so scary.","I think it's important to be extremely proud of one's origins, especially when you are a foreign actress with ethnic features.","I am first and foremost an actress of Indian origin.","I love going into a country and just blending.","Having grown up in Bombay, from the day you're born, you have absolute freedom to choose who you want to be.","I'm a human being before anything else.","I actually didn't mind school, and I enjoyed university and college.","If a cream can give you confidence then you really have to check your whole confidence department in the first place.","I feel like this whole idea of wanting something that you don't really have is also very American in a way.","Everything big-budget or stereotypical I was offered after 'Slumdog Millionaire' was a huge no-no.","I wouldn't want to do a Bollywood film per se, but I would like to do an Indian-language film. For some reason I think Bollywood has become synonymous with commercial cinema, which is song and dance and everything that is larger than life, and I am interested in the reality.","I don't think Bollywood is only mindless cinema, but a lot of films they churn out are not films that I completely enjoy watching.","I absolutely love London; it is one of my favourite cities in the world.","I find it very interesting these days that films are bringing in so many people of different ethnicities, and I'm proud to be a part of that cultural shift.","Of course I'm going to marry, but I don't know when.","I feel being an actress is probably not half as difficult as being a mother, and I do not know when I will be ready for that kind of a decision.","In terms of romantic films, all-time romantic films, I really like 'Gone With the Wind.' And I realize I sound so cliched saying that, but there's something so absolutely romantic about it.","I like working on big budget films.","One of my favorite actors is Javier Bardem, he always challenges his previous roles, and basically does the unexpected.","I went to an all-girls' Christian convent school run by nuns. It was fun, but when I was 15, I said, 'Mum, that's it - I need to go where there are some boys.'","I've never told anyone this before, but I'm an obsessive-compulsive. I go back to my hotel room every evening and put the coat hangers back in order and open my bag and rearrange it. It takes a lot of my time, but if I don't do it I can't sleep.","Here's another secret - I have really big feet. I'm a size ten, so every opportunity I get I buy myself shoes.","Indian celebrities have the media and fans permanently outside their homes, and that would make me really uncomfortable.","I'd like to jump out of a plane. I have a fear of heights I'd like to face."],"Freja Beha Erichsen":["It's important to think about the bigger picture, especially if we are given these platforms. We can make a difference.","My routine is really simple. I wash my face with Bioderma Sensibio H2O, and I exfoliate around once a week. I then use an oil-free moisturiser, and that's pretty much it.","I never really wear any make-up on my face, like foundation or anything - and I really wouldn't advise that you leave that on your skin at night - but I do often leave on my eye make-up overnight. I actually prefer it the next day; it looks more worn-in.","I love to have massages, I think it's really important to relax. In New York, I usually go to Massage Williamsburg or Great Jones Spa.","I get out of bed, brush my teeth, wash my face, put on moisturiser, put on clothes, and leave. Four minutes. I like to shower at night so I can roll out of bed.","I would like to sit down with Emily Dickinson, Virginia Woolf, PJ Harvey, and Bjork. That would be a good dinner in my mind. Strong women. I think I would enjoy that.","I guess I like more of the skinny jeans. I'm not very fond of all the stretch, so I try to avoid too much stretch fabric.","I was a little biker girl. I thought it was cool; everyone else thought it was really weird. The other little girls were all in these pretty dresses, and my mum bought me this black, studded leather jacket, which I loved.","Being a tomboy worked to my advantage in fashion. I'm known as the androgynous girl - I've used it in a way that works for me. I've never felt a pressure to change myself. I do own a few Rick Owens dresses - they're more like long tank tops, though.","I've been travelling around the U.K., actually getting to see places. I'm so lucky that I am able to travel with work, but you don't often get to experience them properly.","I want to carry on modelling for years to come.","You can pull off anything if you have the right attitude. Being cool is whatever you think it is. Own your style.","I've been so blessed to have the career I have had, so each and every shoot and job is a privilege for me to be at.","I grew up playing soccer with the boys - quite far from reading magazines.","I love the process - collaborating with the photographers, traveling, and seeing different cultures. My mother always said I would regret it if I didn't do it. And I think she was right.","Denim should always be comfortable; jeans should protect you. They are workwear."],"French Montana":["My dream pet? I like a couple of them, man: monkey, I love dogs. See, tigers, I don't know - I can't be playing with something like that. A monkey, I can handle it. A dog, yeah; I would get a monkey.","You can't expect to make all this money and not go through problems. You can't expect God to give you everything you want without taking something away.","I speak from the heart. Certain people follow lyricists and people that put words on a dictionary together, and this and that. I'm more of a rapper that speaks how I feel. I just tell it how it is.","When I had a kid and I went through my drama and situation, I respected my father more because it kinda made me understand what he went through with me.","Every man needs a good, solid watch. My favorite watch is the Presidential Rolex. I own many watches, but this one is usually the one on my wrist. I buy mine in the Diamond District in New York City. Classic.","I feel like, you know, some people like to wear colorful stuff. Some people like to be blacked down, and some people just want to be colorful. Some people just have weird problems. I'm never going to wear a pink sweater. Some people just do it because they feel like they can do it.","In school, my favorite subject was math. That's where I learned to count money.","Money is the most important thing because there might be a time when you have no label behind you and you have to carry yourself. Money is the only thing that can shield you.","Umm... I don't judge my relationship with Puff or Bad Boy according to other people or past artists. At the end of the day, you are in charge of your career, and you can't depend on no man to do anything for you. I've learned to judge relationships with a person on myself and that person, not what they have done with previous people.","I like colorful stuff. I like wearing stuff that nobody is wearing. That's why I wear the bear hat. I'll wear the whole mink.","I felt like for what I needed, Bad Boy got me... they got me covered. Especially Puff, man. He's going to be the first billionaire rap entertainer. At the end of the day, they need me. Other artists-labels don't need me, but Bad Boy and Puff needs me. And I need them. It goes both ways.","Besides my son, music is the most important thing to me. I always have music on in my car and playing at house, and I'm in the studio or performing every night. I like Beats by Dre for headphones, and Bang & Olufsen soundsystems.","Whatever rappers wear is cool to people.","I used to play soccer when I was in Morocco, but I was more of a basketball player. I played high school basketball, I played AAU basketball.","Coming from Morocco was just different, man. It's a third-world country, and you are trying to make it happen. That's all it is. I didn't have any problem hooking up with the black kids because I'm from North Africa. And as far as Latinos, we are all the same.","It's Fendi. French, Fendi, both start with an F... I fell in love with it. Smells like grown-man cologne.","I've tried every kind of bottled water, but Poland Spring is my go-to. I always have room-temperature bottles of it on side of stage for post-performance.","I was born in Morocco and lived there until I was 13; I'm really proud of my heritage.","Is it important to have a crew behind me? No, it's important to have me behind them. That's how I look at it. You can't just roll with a situation like you're depending on somebody to help you. You're supposed to help the situation, whatever the situation is that you're in.","Every time I look at Twitter, there's always somebody showing support.","The hardest situation to pick up a girl in is ... in church and in Morocco on Ramadan. On Ramadan or one of those religious days? Try to pick up a girl is bananas.","I have been a fan of Versace for so long, watching people like Biggie, Puff, Jay-Z.","I was never officially signed with Akon, but it was a shopping deal. That was around the time he was going through some problems with his label at Interscope. I waited, but when a deal didn't happen, I just went out on my own.","I'm not going to go to a producer that's going to take me in a studio and charge me my whole budget and give me a fake head nod. I'm just trying to make good music. I appreciate everybody that's supporting me.","Before I had a son, I used to look at my father's example: he left me, he left my mother. When I had a son, I got caught in the same situation that his mother don't want me to see him. I started looking at my father in a different light.","I don't want to sound like Ross; I don't want to sound like Puff. I want to make my own music: French Montana.","Besides buying a mansion or something, everything I wanted I always got. I'm just ready to invest it and save it. Otherwise, life can hit you, but you can't go back to working at Home Depot. That's why I always just be stacking.","Sometimes I take off my skully and wear glasses, so I've gotta brush and make sure my hairline is straight.","I came from battling, knowing about the lyrics. All that's cool, but if you want people to love you, you have to talk to them about what they go through.","At the end of the day, you got to learn from people that been through what you been through; they help you learn from your mistakes."],"French Stewart":["Everyone seems to have this awareness of Charlie Chaplin because he was a really good businessman while Buster Keaton wasn't.","Buster Keaton is my hero.","I come from a heavy-lidded people. My family, you'll see pictures of them, and it's the same thing all the way back to Scotland."],"Freya Stark":["Curiosity is the one thing invincible in Nature.","If we are strong, and have faith in life and its richness of surprises, and hold the rudder steadily in our hands. I am sure we will sail into quiet and pleasent waters for our old age.","Few are the giants of the soul who actually feel that the human race is their family circle.","Absence is one of the most useful ingredients of family life, and to dose it rightly is an art like any other.","There can be no happiness if the things we believe in are different from the things we do.","Christmas... is not an external event at all, but a piece of one's home that one carries in one's heart.","To awaken quite alone in a strange town is one of the pleasantest sensations in the world.","The great and almost only comfort about being a woman is that one can always pretend to be more stupid than one is and no one is surprised.","Pain and fear and hunger are effects of causes which can be foreseen and known: but sorrow is a debt which someone else makes for us."],"Freya Tingley":["It's about not having doubt in your mind and staying focused and not having any preconceived notion about failure. It's just looking forward and staying positive.","It's important for any child really to have somebody to back you up and let you follow your dream.","Plan B is a plan to fail. You should always give 110% to what you plan to do for plan A.","I really wanted to be a spy. I guess it's a bit like acting, where you play a role.","I knew my priority was acting, and school came second. If I had an audition and meetings, I did the school work later.","One of the great things about working for Netflix is that they haven't placed any restrictions on content or artistically.","Acting was just something that came really naturally to me, and it was just something that I knew how to do.","Whatever I ended up picking or choosing was always going to be a creative outlet for me.","I'd been going to school up to the third term of year 11 at MLC, and there was no point in dropping out. Having gone through Year 12, there's so much that helps you acquire the knowledge you need. It helps you in life."],"Frida Giannini":["Venice never quite seems real, but rather an ornate film set suspended on the water.","I don't want to be too 'classic' because it's not in the DNA of Gucci. You need to be a little bit provocative.","The idea of 'ferie,' or summer break, is a long tradition of which all Italians, including myself, participate. It's a time to relax, reflect and recharge.","My biggest satisfaction is always when I make something beautiful and well-done that I can see on a real man or woman - not only in the glossy magazines.","All the drawings and sketches and clothes of Yves Saint Laurent in the '70s were so colorful, so bright.","I think the '70s are always inspiring to me. I was born then, so I have a lot of memories about how my parents were and what kinds of movies I was watching.","I don't like to treat a piece of clothing like an object of art because I don't consider myself an artist. I'm a designer.","When I joined Gucci in 2002, I immediately wanted to make a research trip into the archives because I'd heard about how incredible they were, but I never had the opportunity to visit them.","I inherited this collection of vinyl records, which at that time numbered 6,000, and I've since continued to collect music. As you know, vinyl records can be very heavy, so every time I have to move into a new house, I need to build a complete new wall of shelves to put all these records, which is a nightmare for the architect.","I always loved the look of musicians. I've always admired them because they have a look - when I was growing up, it seemed that the ones I liked didn't need to have a stylist.","I grew up in Rome, in actually what I would say was a liberal, open-minded family. My father was an architect and my mother was a teacher of art history, so it was sort of intellectual, and maybe a bit much for me when I was a child.","I like tough relationships. I think relationships with conflict are good for you - you learn. But you can't listen too much. I have a strong point of view, and it's important that I fight for my ideas.","I am comfortable giving people direction. If something is not good enough, my job is to find a way to help them learn from their mistake, and understand that next time I expect better."],"Frida Gustavsson":["Fragrance is, to me, something very personal; because it is something you wear every day, it should represent you and be an extension of your style.","I try to be as organic and natural as possible when it comes to make up, so I always carry around coconut oil for removing and jojoba or Argan oil as a moisturiser.","I'm obsessed with vinyasa flow yoga and Pilates. And since I live in Sweden, and we have good seafood, I tend to cook a lot of fish, preferably with oven-roasted veggies and a cauliflower mash.","A Maybelline New York woman is strong and confident - I love that attitude.","I'm honored and thrilled to represent such an iconic brand and to be a part of the Maybelline New York family."],"Frida Kahlo":["I love you more than my own skin.","Feet, what do I need you for when I have wings to fly?","I am my own muse, the subject I know best.","I never paint dreams or nightmares. I paint my own reality.","I leave you my portrait so that you will have my presence all the days and nights that I am away from you.","I tried to drown my sorrows, but the bastards learned how to swim, and now I am overwhelmed by this decent and good feeling.","I paint flowers so they will not die.","The only thing I know is that I paint because I need to, and I paint whatever passes through my head without any other consideration.","They thought I was a Surrealist, but I wasn't. I never painted dreams. I painted my own reality.","My painting carries with it the message of pain.","I paint self-portraits because I am so often alone, because I am the person I know best.","I am happy to be alive, as long as I can paint.","There have been two great accidents in my life. One was the trolley, and the other was Diego. Diego was by far the worst.","To paint is the most terrific thing that there is, but to do it well is very difficult.","Since my subjects have always been my sensations, my states of mind and the profound reactions that life has been producing in me, I have frequently objectified all this in figures of myself, which were the most sincere and real thing that I could do in order to express what I felt inside and outside of myself.","The most important part of the body is the brain. Of my face, I like the eyebrows and eyes. Aside from that, I like nothing. My head is too small.","I paint my own reality. The only thing I know is that I paint because I need to, and I paint whatever passes through my head without any other consideration.","I put on the canvas whatever comes into my mind.","I was a child who went about in a world of colors... My friends, my companions, became women slowly; I became old in instants.","Really, I do not know whether my paintings are surrealist or not, but I do know that they are the frankest expression of myself.","Painting completed my life.","I find that Americans completely lack sensibility and good taste. They are boring, and they all have faces like unbaked rolls.","Of the opposite sex, I have the moustache and, in general, the face.","I don't know how to write love letters.","I am in agreement with everything my father taught me and nothing my mother taught me.","My toys were those of a boy: skates, bicycles."],"Frida Lyngstad":["Being rich and famous isn't all happiness and at times the pressures have got to me.","The kind of music I like depends very much on my mood.","I must have some sort of record in failing to get into the charts.","Money cannot buy happiness.","I like to think of myself as being fashion-conscious without being a slave to fashion."],"Fridtjof Nansen":["I demolish my bridges behind me - then there is no choice but forward.","Never stop because you are afraid - you are never so likely to be wrong.","It is better to go skiing and think of God, than go to church and think of sport.","The difficult is what takes a little time; the impossible is what takes a little longer.","Alas!

an authoritarian determination of the status of each individual in the new hierarchical order.","We know, in other words, the general conditions in which what we call, somewhat misleadingly, an equilibrium will establish itself: but we never know what the particular prices or wages are which would exist if the market were to bring about such an equilibrium.","Why should we, however, in economics, have to plead ignorance of the sort of facts on which, in the case of a physical theory, a scientist would certainly be expected to give precise information?","Freedom granted only when it is known beforehand that its effects will be beneficial is not freedom.","If most people are not willing to see the difficulty, this is mainly because, consciously or unconsciously, they assume that it will be they who will settle these questions for the others, and because they are convinced of their own capacity to do this.","The credit which the apparent conformity with recognized scientific standards can gain for seemingly simple but false theories may, as the present instance shows, have grave consequences.","I have arrived at the conviction that the neglect by economists to discuss seriously what is really the crucial problem of our time is due to a certain timidity about soiling their hands by going from purely scientific questions into value questions.","It is rather a problem of how to secure the best use of resources known to any of the members of society, for ends whose relative importance only those individuals know.","We have indeed at the moment little cause for pride: as a profession we have made a mess of things.","It can hardly be denied that such a demand quite arbitrarily limits the facts which are to be admitted as possible causes of the events which occur in the real world.","I regard it in fact as the great advantage of the mathematical technique that it allows us to describe, by means of algebraic equations, the general character of a pattern even where we are ignorant of the numerical values which will determine its particular manifestation.","This means that to entrust to science - or to deliberate control according to scientific principles - more than scientific method can achieve may have deplorable effects.","The progress of the natural sciences in modern times has of course so much exceeded all expectations that any suggestion that there may be some limits to it is bound to arouse suspicion."],"Friedrich Bergius":["Even in the investigations into direct production of calcium peroxide in an alkali melt with highly compressed oxygen, it was found to be necessary to bring the high-pressure gas into contact with the suspension of lime in caustic alkali melt by agitation or some other means of mixing.","As early as 1912, we worked on the problem of the hydrogenation of organic substances with the aid of highly compressed hydrogen.","As early as 1910, Ludwig Landsberg had suggested that I should examine the problem of splitting heavy oils and oil residues into benzines."],"Friedrich Durrenmatt":["Without tolerance, our world turns into hell.","The difference between humans and wild animals is that humans pray before they commit murder.","This inhuman world has to become more humane.

We humans are - more humane.","War has always been the grand sagacity of every spirit which has grown too inward and too profound; its curative power lies even in the wounds one receives.","The world itself is the will to power - and nothing else! And you yourself are the will to power - and nothing else!","It is good to express a thing twice right at the outset and so to give it a right foot and also a left one.

The inference is false, a gift confers no rights.","I do not know what the spirit of a philosopher could more wish to be than a good dancer. For the dance is his ideal, also his fine art, finally also the only kind of piety he knows, his 'divine service.'","Experience, as a desire for experience, does not come off. We must not study ourselves while having an experience.","Extreme positions are not succeeded by moderate ones, but by contrary extreme positions.","Women are considered deep - why? Because one can never discover any bottom to them. Women are not even shallow.","Today I love myself as I love my god: who could charge me with a sin today? I know only sins against my god; but who knows my god?","Genteel women suppose that those things do not really exist about which it is impossible to talk in polite company.","Stupid as a man, say the women: cowardly as a woman, say the men.

How many other countries would let me do that?","The accounting of the sacrifice is, more than anything else, the attitude toward war memorials in our time.","The freedom to express yourself without fear - that perhaps is something we in the U.S. take for granted. It's almost inconceivable to think we would be afraid to express our opinions or thoughts, but that's not true for all parts of the world now, and certainly not before World War II.","I remember saying that wars must not be glorified, but wars must be remembered.","I think it is fair to say that during World War II there was a high sense of purpose.

The world has known only about a half dozen geniuses. I got only fairly near.","Signs of fatigue soon manifested themselves more and more strongly, and slowly the men dropped out one by one, from sheer exhaustion. No murmur of complaint, however, would be heard.","What impressed me particularly in Vienna was the strict order everywhere. No mob disturbances of any kind, in spite of the greatly increased liberty and relaxation of police regulations.","IN trying to recall my impressions during my short war duty as an officer in the Austrian Army, I find that my recollections of this period are very uneven and confused.","One gets into a strange psychological, almost hypnotic, state of mind while on the firing line which probably prevents the mind's eye from observing and noticing things in a normal way.","The outbreak of the war found my wife and me in Switzerland, where we were taking a cure.","Although I had resigned my commission as an officer two years before, I immediately left Switzerland, accompanied by my wife, in order to report for duty. As it happened, a wire reached me a day later calling me to the colors.","My wife volunteered her services as Red Cross nurse, insisting upon being sent to the front, in order to be as near me as could be, but it developed later that no nurse was allowed to go farther than the large troop hospitals far in the rear of the actual operations.","The moral effect of the thundering of one's own artillery is most extraordinary, and many of us thought that we had never heard any more welcome sound than the deep roaring and crashing that started in at our rear.","Suddenly, at about ten o'clock, a dull thud sounded somewhere far away from us, and simultaneously we saw a small white round cloud about half a mile ahead of us where the shrapnel had exploded. The battle had begun.","We started at once to dig our trenches, half of my platoon stepping forward abreast, the men being placed an arm's length apart. After laying their rifles down, barrels pointing to the enemy, a line was drawn behind the row of rifles and parallel to it.","I saw a great many men die afterwards, some suffering horribly, but I do not recall any death that affected me quite so much as that of this first victim in my platoon.","Life that only a few hours before had glowed with enthusiasm and exultation, suddenly paled and sickened."],"Fritz Lang":["Each picture has some sort of rhythm which only the director can give it. He has to be like the captain of a ship.","For me, cinema is a vice. I love it intimately.","You cannot make a social-conscious picture in which you say that the intermediary between the hand and the brain is the heart. I mean, that's a fairy tale - definitely.","I am profoundly fascinated by cruelty, fear, horror and death. My films show my preoccupation with violence, the pathology of violence.","I was called the greatest director in Europe, but I was just a hard worker.","Women have always been my best friends.","In America, sex is preached; in France, it is done.","It is just that all my life I have been so involved in my work that I guess one could say in general that, whenever I had to balance my private life and my profession, my profession always won out.","I was something that is always hated in Hollywood - a perfectionist; nobody likes a perfectionist, you know.","My private life has nothing to do with my films.","I like folk songs, but ten horses couldn't bring me to a concert or an opera.","Music is the same to me as it was to Goethe - a pleasant noise.

And in this world war the Fuehrer refuses to allow me to serve as a soldier.","As a cabin boy on a Norwegian sailing ship I earned five kronen a week in addition to my keep.","As I, as a worker, came to know them, the aims of German trade unions were political, and there were a number of various trade unions with varied political views.","As regards personal relationships I cannot say that I had any particularly personal intercourse with anyone.","At that time we were very definitely told that under no circumstances should there be any secret chapters or any other secrecy in the life of the Party, but that everything should be done publicly.","I am very proud of the fact that many workers in my Gau, numerous former Communists and Social Democrats were won over by us and became local group leaders and Party functionaries.","I attended the elementary school at Schweinfurt and the secondary school.","I became Gauleiter in 1927.","I did that all the more, if I may say so, because I was aware of the fact that there is an inclination to go to extremes in German people, and in the German character generally.","I had repeatedly made written requests to the Fuehrer that I might be allowed to join the Wehrmacht as an ordinary soldier. He refused to give me this permission.","I joined the Party definitely in 1923 after having already been in sympathy with it before.","I was elected to the Diet in the same way as at every parliamentary election.","I was member of the Diet as long as it existed, until May 1933.","I was never informed in advance about the start of the war or about foreign political developments.","In my Gau, as far as I know, only Communists who had actually worked against the State were arrested.","It so happened that I was on a German sailing vessel on the way to Australia when the ship was captured, and on the high seas I was made prisoner by the French.","Many years before I had left a beautiful country and a rich nation and I returned to that country six years later to find it fundamentally changed and in a state of upheaval, and in great spiritual and material need.","My connection with the Reich Ministers was of a purely official nature and was very infrequent.","One day I heard a speech of Hitler. In this speech he said that the German factory worker and the German labourer must make common cause with the German intellectual worker.","The citizen parties, by an absolute majority, elected a National Socialist Government.","The controversies between the proletariat and the middle class had to be smoothed out and bridged over by each getting to know and understand the other.","The Diet was dissolved by a Reich Government decree.","The dissolution of the trade unions was in the air then.","Through the Young Men's Christian Association and principally in Australia and North America, as well as in South America, I came into contact with families of these countries.","When she became very ill with heart trouble, I saw that it would be impossible for my parents to provide for my studies, and I obtained their permission to go to sea to make a career for myself there."],"Fritz Scholder":["I give thanks everyday that I've been able to take my craziness and make it work for me.","We need art more than ever as we stagger toward the Millennium."],"Fritz Todt":["These roads do not serve transportation alone, they also bind our Fatherland.","The ever increasing spiritual damage caused by life within the big city will make this hunger practically uncontrollable when we build here on this the landscape of our homeland we must be clear that we will protect its beauty.","The external appearance of any construction projects that are created during the time of the National Socialist Reich must take on the sensibility of our time.","Factories are the workplaces of our National Socialist racial comrades.","We do not build speedways, but roads which correspond to the character of the German landscape.","For decades engineers have stood accused that their buildings do not have any cultural value. We have attempted to liberate engineering of this accusation.","In these highways our engineering will reflect the National Socialist movement.","In places where this beauty has already disappeared, we will reconstruct it.","The car is not a rabbit or a deer that jumps around in sweeping lines, but it is a man-made work of technology in need of an appropriate roadway.","The car resembles a dragon fly or any other jumping animal that moves shorter distances in straight lines and then changes its direction at different points.","Only one country and one system is unable to recognize our accomplishments: Russia.

The answer is to whittle it down to proper size with terrajets and nuclear power, using the debris to increase the size of Jupiter's moons so they, too, can be colonized.","The universe is so unique and perfect that it could not have originated by chance but was divined by flawless, creative design.","Major actions by courageous and wise men will be necessary to avoid our continuing to blunder into the space age like unenlightened and selfish idiots.","Every evening, I come home tired and have just enough energy to fill out the endless tax forms, to pay bills, not to let my house neglected and to hear the radio concert for an hour.","If many things in the past have gone wrong in the lives of men and in the lives of their communities, it is because both small- and large-scale activities were blundered into without any thought or vision of universal planning.","I have a good idea every two years. Give me a topic, I will give you the idea!","I soon became convinced... that all the theorizing would be empty brain exercise and therefore a waste of time unless one first ascertained what the population of the universe really consists of.","Mountains were once my big adventure but is is over since a long time; I still dream from the wonderful days sometimes, read also a few pages from a mountain book. But the thought of doing again active mountain climbing has faded.","Astronautics, strictly speaking, will be concerned with voyages to other stars.

They make many products with the aim of raising sales. But then profits decline, and companies find themselves falling into debt... I changed the mindset at Canon by getting people to realize that profits come first.","The world is facing a new networked, digital lifestyle, and we will ensure that Canon remains ahead of the game.","In the 1970s, Japan moved into the U.S. turf with its televisions, cars, chips, and steel. But if you think about it, the only business Japan destroyed was the U.S. television industry.","Whatever the trend in exchange rates or whatever the external factors, a manufacturing company is always faced with the mission of transforming itself into a company that can produce higher value-added to absorb the increase in the cost of living in the country it's operating in.","Canon is basically a very aggressive company. Our company works on competitive principles. It does not treat people equally, but it does treat them fairly."],"Fulton J. Sheen":["The proud man counts his newspaper clippings, the humble man his blessings.","Jealousy is the tribute mediocrity pays to genius.","Hearing nuns' confessions is like being stoned to death with popcorn.","Show me your hands. Do they have scars from giving? Show me your feet. Are they wounded in service? Show me your heart. Have you left a place for divine love?","Pride is an admission of weakness; it secretly fears all competition and dreads all rivals.","Love is a mutual self-giving which ends in self-recovery.","Life is like a cash register, in that every account, every thought, every deed, like every sale, is registered and recorded.","I feel it is time that I also pay tribute to my four writers, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.","The big print giveth, and the fine print taketh away.","Baloney is flattery laid on so thick it cannot be true, and blarney is flattery so thin we love it."],"Fulton Oursler":["We crucify ourselves between two thieves: regret for yesterday and fear of tomorrow.","Many of us crucify ourselves between two thieves - regret for the past and fear of the future.","In this one book are the two most interesting personalities in the whole world - God and yourself.

This the way I eat.","Don't ask for a million dollars. Ask for the stuff that'll get you a million dollars - your health, your brain, your sanity, wisdom. Prepare me for when I do get that million. Make sure I don't go crazy, make sure I help my family.","You got one life to live. So I'm living it the way I want to live it.","I was shy talking about certain things, and I was shy with being honest because I didn't want people to judge me talking about fatherhood and how somebody should have my child around me.","At the end of the day, I'm out of here - above anything.","Everybody can relate to being real or true.

You just know that's how it is.","My music is like a diary. I use every experience.","I like to express myself through the clothes that I wear.","I'm not for the publicity stunts. Leave my son out of the publicity stunts.","Man, I wanna be there for everybody. I wanna make everybody happy, and I can't... That's why I stay in the studio.","My career choice is my career choice. Just stepping out of that zone, to be able to be a provider. I understand my position as a provider and my role as a dad also... Just being able to be comfortable with it.","My sister wants a Rollie.

But it does get your mind off it.","Life is not a bowl full of cherries, there's good and bad stuff.","If the pressure is getting to you, whistle. In a barely audible way.
