So I find myself living day to day trying to do my best, embracing every moment as a learning opportunity and chance to get to know myself a little more.","If Pocahontas had been given the foresight to see what devastating consequences her actions and belief in the possibility of peace would have brought upon her people, I wonder if she would have avoided befriending the English or not.","I really identified with Pocahontas' struggles as a young woman trying to identify herself in a modern, changing world and trying to stay true to her culture and heritage.","I just want to learn even more about my culture and about the Algonquin culture because I fell in love with Pocahontas and the Algonquin tribe.","Here in L.A., you kind of get stuck in your own little dilemmas and your own little life, and hearing a story like Pocahontas' reminds you there's a bigger world out there, and there are so many more important things in life.","Instead of locking people up and throwing away the key, it's important to invest in them and show them another way - show them what they can do, instead of telling them what they can't do. Because by investing in youth, we're investing into the future of this great nation of the United States of America.","I feel like, as a celebrity, I have a responsibility to tell important stories.","The things I do, I do from the heart and out of love and respect for our planet and all living things. And I draw my courage from my love for justice and truth, and I calm my fears by comforting those who are more scared than me. And I try to do my best to make the world a better place, one small action at a time, as good as I can.","In Peru, if you gave somebody a little chance to do something, they took it to the furthest extent. They took nothing for granted. And here in L.A., you kind of get caught up in your own little dilemmas and your own little life.","I always wanted to be a singer, and so, when I was 5 years old, I started acting classes so I could be a better performer. I wanted to have a powerful voice so I could be heard.","Yes, I'm proud to be indigenous. I'm half-Quechua-Huachipaeri from Peru.","I prefer home-schooling because you can work at your own pace and go towards more what you're interested in, whether it be history or geography or math.","I love the power of celebrity because you can give voice to the voiceless.","Portraying Pocahontas' story well was important to me because she was a real person and these were real events in her life.","My father's Peruvian! I actually have a lot of family in Cuzco. I'm also Swiss, Alaskan, French, Spanish and Italian.","'Firelight' is a beautiful story about a lot of young women. My character, Caroline, is a girl who has a bad boyfriend, and he ends up getting her locked up and incarcerated.","My birthday is Feb. 11, and I'm both excited and not excited by it. You'll never be 15 again, and you really, really need to savor every day like it's your last.","I know that might sound silly coming from someone my age, but I remember on my 14th birthday having a crisis like my mom should be having. I kept thinking that I was getting older, and I haven't really accomplished anything. I remember thinking that I better accomplish something real soon.","You need people around you that care about you and are thinking about you in your best interest. And keep your mind straight.","I honestly think I was an Indian living in the time of the Trail of Tears. Something like that. Every time I read books about back then, I get so devastatingly sad, so, so... I feel such a deep connection to it.","I lose film roles because I'm a person who doesn't keep quiet about certain things. But if my heart tells me something is wrong, I'm going to go and do something about it.","Films are very influential, and I especially feel a responsibility to tell stories that have been pushed aside. Being able to shed light on issues that need to be brought to the world.","I grew up doing a lot of traveling. My mom left home when she was 15 and traveled to 48 different countries and speaks six different languages. So I grew up with my eyes open. She raised me so that if my heart says something is wrong, I have to go help. What's right is right and what's wrong is wrong."],"Q-Tip":["I grew up on the rough side of the tracks. If you looked like you were soft, you would be fodder for the wolves. I came up in my neighbourhood like, 'I'm just gonna be me,' and all the thugs just said, 'It's OK, he's special.' They knew I had the talent with the rhymes, so they kept me around.","You know, I hate to sound self-involved, but I feel like I haven't peaked yet.","Predating the Internet and predating videos, you had an active imagination. You would hear sounds and then get mental pictures of what these sounds felt like to you. It engaged you and made you more invested in it. It made you want to get tickets to the show, buy the album, put the poster on the wall. Now it's sensory overload.","One thing the music industry has taught me is to manage my expectations.","In theory, people would pick progression every time over being idle. But if you look at us as a culture, as a people, you would say that if you get up at five o'clock in the morning, eat your breakfast, go to work, make money, pay your bills, you're progressing, when you're still doing what's comfortable.","I think I have great responsibility, and when I do my music, when I try to relate to my audience, I just try to do it in an honest fashion, you know, just try to be as earnest as possible and sometime it may be self-effacing. Sometimes it may be finger-pointing. Sometimes it may be beautiful, and sometime it may be ugly.","If there's a 'Cruel Summer' then there's got to be a 'Cruel Winter,' right? That's all I'm saying.","I definitely move to the beat of my own drummer and man, he's not playing something anyone has heard before. It's pretty cool, though.

But I don't sit quietly and listen to my work; I'm always off to do the next thing.","I'm kind of a pop culture stew, you know.","I feel like Barack Obama, kind of in a political sense, embodies that same kind of spirit as a Q-Tip or a Santogold or a Common. I feel like there is a synergy going on here in this country and abroad. I feel like the doors are open, and it's time to push them wide open.","I sang in church, but growing up in the neighborhood, music was more of an expression of relief or entertainment.","I'm in a hallowed league of artists. Whether it's Billie Holiday or Rakim or Jimmy Hendrix or... I don't know, MGMT, we're all blessed to be able to create. It's a lineage that extends a long time. And to be able to be active in it and have made a difference in it, it's humbling. To know I had a place in all of this; that's the rewarding part.","A lot of people who curate in the business, and curate the art, don't really have good artistic sense. They may know commerce, but they aren't savvy enough to know how to balance commerce and art, you know? They don't know how to satisfy both palates.","Dealing with those personalities and the people who run this music thing has been most challenging. It's hard to really communicate things to people who run a business yet forget the nature of the business. They only look at the bottom line and the financial return, you know, they forget what it is they're packaging. It's art.","I do try to speak of positive things. I still try to, like, present two sides of the story, and I do try to relate to life in a 360 degree and not be one-dimensional. But by all means, manage expectations.","The song, 'Life is Better,' is about hip-hop. It's about my love for hip-hop. And, you know, I go through all the artists from the beginning to the end, you know. And, well, not to the end, but since the beginning to now, you know.","In 1999, I just came out of putting out the song 'Vivrant Thing' and 'Breathe and Stop' off the 'Amplified' album. Clive Davis signed me to Arista.","It's called 'I Wanna Thank You,' and I'm encouraging everybody out there to blog, Tweet, Facebook, anything about it. Let's sign a petition. The petition is called 'Busta Rhymes Make 'I Wanna Thank You' Your First Single.'","I feel like Obama in a way. His idea that hope means not shrinking from a fight; it's the courage to reach for something. My music is that. Those are principles I try to embody.","I shot a movie with Nicole Kidman that I got cut out of - it was crap anyways.","For people who love Tribe, I'm the defector. They say, 'You should get back with Ali to do the beats.' But a lot of people don't realize I did all the music in Tribe. In the first three albums, I did all the beats!","On the radio there's only a certain amount of artists: Jay-Z, Beyonce, Kanye, T-Pain, Lil Wayne, T.I., Mary J Blige, Alicia Keys. Other artists are achieving things that are really special, they have a hard time getting people's attention. Music has been just a little bit lacklustre.","I read the Koran and it appealed to me. At the time I was agnostic and it really breathed spiritually back into me. For me it's really a cushion; it's cool, I'm cool with it."],"Qandeel Baloch":["Love me or hate me, both are in my favour. If you love me, I will always be in your heart, and if you hate me, I will be in your mind.","At least international media can see how I am trying to change the typical orthodox mindset of people who don't want to come out of their shells of false beliefs and old practices.","I've fought with everyone .

Let's open our minds and live in present.","I am not hungry for roles on TV or in films. I am happy being a social media sensation.","What do you think will happen in a forced marriage? With an uneducated man, an animal. What would I say, that I am already married? Why would I say it? I never accepted him as my husband in my heart or mind. How I spent a year and a half with him, only I know. And I only did it because of the child.","I was 17 when I was forced into marriage. I had no hand in it, and I didn't even enjoy being with the man. Also, I wanted to study, but no one listened to me. I wanted to move forward in life, it wasn't a happy situation. Because of some family problems, I had to stick around.","My work is entertainment, and I look at what entertains people, whether it's a selfie video or a music video.","Media is not supporting me. They're saying that I want to marry Imran Khan, but I'm already married. This is wrong. What about my self-worth? My identity? I am a social media sensation. I am a fashion icon.","Please don't compare me with Taher Shah. He is a joker, while I am an artiste - I am a model and an actress. Taher Shah comes, makes people laugh, and goes away. I work with a lot of honesty.","Nothing is good in this society. This patriarchal society is bad.","I don't know how many girls have felt support through my persona. I'm a girl power. So many girls tell me I'm a girl power, and yes, I am.","It was my wish since I was a child to become something, to be able to stand on my own two feet, to do something for myself.","My aim is to change the social norms of Pakistan; women here look up to me. I started very early, worked on myself, and the effect is for all to see.","I want to give my followers a positive message. I want to give those girls a positive message who have been forcefully married, who continue to sacrifice. I want to be an example for those people. That's my aim.","It was about 2012, 2013. I started from zero. Small fashion shows, small photoshoots. I've seen a lot. I've seen a lot of things up close. I married my sister off; I gave jahez for her wedding. I tried to keep relations going with my family. I bought a house for them in Multan. My parents are settled in Multan; my house is there.","I did a job. I completed my Matric and my Bachelors. I did a marketing job. I worked as a bus hostess. I did a lot of jobs; I struggled a lot. I got out from there. The first thing I did when I got out of Darul Aman was my Matric. Then I did my Bachelors privately; I kept doing it.","Pakistan is a free country, so according to me, in a free country, it's every right of the citizen to live the way they wish."],"Quavo":["History repeats itself. So you might wanna pay attention.","We not trying to do what everybody else is doing.","There ain't nothing that we need to be worried about. We just need to be in the right lane where everybody else be in the left lane.","I want to thank my momma for pulling up. I want to thank my boys who was with me since day one; thank you for pulling up on me.","Wealth is just consistency... I don't want to be rich. I want to be wealthy.","Being spontaneous is a blessing.","Can't even see without my vintage Versace frames. I don't go nowhere without them on. I can't even live without them. Every time I throw them on, I see all the haters, and I see where the money at.","When you do it yourself, you feel better.","I'd open doors for anyone who opens doors for me.","We just feel like history repeats itself. You ain't never going to see nothing brand new; you're only going to see when records are broken. And we're here to just set records and set trends and follow the footsteps that have been shown to us.","People want to know where I'm going, and I just don't ever know.","Whatever makes your head nod, that's want we want to give you.","The crazy thing about the dab is like - dance moves, once you create them, they last forever.","I couldn't follow nobody's rules.","You gotta give everybody a new trend a new wave, something new to do.","Our fashion style is very legendary and very classic. I feel like it's different, and I feel like everybody got our own different style to bring to the table.","We gon' be around for a long time.","I'm just willing to try different things. But you gotta keep it all making sense.","You have to take over your town in order to take over your city.","The culture means the younger generation respecting the OGs, but at the same time, bringing it all to the older generation to where they can relate.","We just compare our lifestyle to movies so you can relate to them. When I say, 'I bought a carpet from Aladdin so I could finesse and do magic,' that means I had to get me a new whip or I had to get me something in disguise to work my magic, to finesse, to get out of here.","Nobody's gonna care about your stuff the way you do.","We always trend set.","My mama just accepted everybody with open arms. Everybody knew her.","I'll tell ya, when you open up that can of dab, it's always fresh.","We need the world to respect us. They consume a lot of hits and just act like it wasn't... I ain't never seen nobody make these many hits and not get notified for it. And change the game like we did and bring the flow to the game the way we did and not get noticed for it, like the the big way - the real system way.","We are creating the new Atlanta, along with Rich Homie Quan and Young Thug. We bring the spaghetti, put it in the bowl, mix it together, and we make the new Atlanta.","I ain't going to sit here like, 'My neighborhood was hard, and I had to get out there and grind.' We made it hard for ourselves. We chose to stay on the streets.","Offset's the animal out the group. But he ain't no bad guy.","All these police treating our people wrong, man. Black lives matter, but we got fans of all different colors, so all lives matter.","We always did everything ourselves.","The people we grew up watching and listening to - Outkast, Gucci Mane, Hot Boys, Lil Wayne, Master P - all that type of stuff, we took those styles and made it our own.","We gave the world dab fever!","The plan is to make money, and we know the fans are going to ask for mixtapes, and those mixtapes are going to hit. So when we put a tape out, we have more money coming in, that's why we work hard at it.","I got a record with Frank Ocean.","On my first day in office as President Quavo, I'd move my whole family into the White House. Second, I'd pull all the troops back. Third, I'd raise the minimum wage to a good, nice amount so people get paid.","Our first album didn't work because we tried to be something we're not.","In ninth grade, I played wide receiver.","We're from Athens, GA.; we're big Bulldog fans, and I remember watching A. J. Green, David Pollock, David Greene. We were big Cowboys and Falcons fans.","Our music attracts the people that we rap about and make music about, and they come out and actually do it.","We grew up listening to music like that: we grew up on the snap music, grew up off the trap music, grew up on all the South sound.","My vision and my creative ability is just so broad.","We had to get serious and hit all aspects. We had to graduate. That's what you got to do: reach all people across the nation.","The artists that we grew up listening to was also independent like Master P, like Birdman and Lil Wayne. Those are the people that we wanted to model ourselves after. Throwing on the Cartier frames, the army-style fatigue jackets.","I knew I was going to be somebody.","We just here to do our job.","Girls run the world.","If you real from the heart, you real from the heart. That ain't got nothing to do with no sex or gender.","I'm a '90s baby.","Girls always make our music go. They set the trends.

We came in the game, and we learned from the best.","We knew we were going to do a fashion line at some point.","Our quarterbacks were getting hurt; a couple got kicked out of school. The coach asked who wanted to try out for QB. I went and tried out, and from there on, I was a quarterback. I was ineligible in 10th grade until spring, so I did baseball. I started in left field and pitched.","You got to expand the sound to expand your horizon and your fanbase.","It's a blessing to have fans acknowledging your craft, period.","We can't stop anybody from doing what they want to do.","I feel like we can learn from each other by us, being the young generation, giving knowledge to the older guys.","We make songs like a factory and put them out.","As artists, we're always going to like the songs we just now made over the songs we made a year ago.","Got your mama and sister dabbing.","We want you to pay attention.","It should take you 15 minutes to make a song, and then get out of there.","Hip-hop was started on groups.","The greatest MCs came out of groups; the greatest singers came out of groups. So you can't tell us we're not MCs.","We know the fans love us to death, and the people that hear out music love our music.","If you want the Migos to come to your venue, you need to have security there because of the type of music we're rappin'.

She was an exceptional and gifted human being. In good times and bad, she never lost her capacity to smile and laugh, nor to inspire others with her warmth and kindness. I admired and respected her - for her energy and commitment to others, and especially for her devotion to her two boys.","The lessons from the peace process are clear; whatever life throws at us, our individual responses will be all the stronger for working together and sharing the load.","I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.","To what greater inspiration and counsel can we turn than to the imperishable truth to be found in this treasure house, the Bible?","At its heart, engineering is about using science to find creative, practical solutions. It is a noble profession.","What were once only hopes for the future have now come to pass; it is almost exactly 13 years since the overwhelming majority of people in Ireland and Northern Ireland voted in favour of the agreement signed on Good Friday 1998, paving the way for Northern Ireland to become the exciting and inspirational place that it is today.","I have to be seen to be believed.","Therefore I am sure that this, my Coronation, is not the symbol of a power and a splendor that are gone but a declaration of our hopes for the future, and for the years I may, by God's Grace and Mercy, be given to reign and serve you as your Queen.","I myself prefer my New Zealand eggs for breakfast.","The events that I have attended to mark my Diamond Jubilee have been a humbling experience. It has touched me deeply to see so many thousands of families, neighbors and friends celebrating together in such a happy atmosphere.","I cannot lead you into battle. I do not give you laws or administer justice but I can do something else - I can give my heart and my devotion to these old islands and to all the peoples of our brotherhood of nations.","I have behind me not only the splendid traditions and the annals of more than a thousand years but the living strength and majesty of the Commonwealth and Empire; of societies old and new; of lands and races different in history and origins but all, by God's Will, united in spirit and in aim.","To all those who have suffered as a consequence of our troubled past I extend my sincere thoughts and deep sympathy. With the benefit of historical hindsight we can all see things which we would wish had been done differently or not at all.","In remembering the appalling suffering of war on both sides, we recognise how precious is the peace we have built in Europe since 1945.","Like all best families, we have our share of eccentricities, of impetuous and wayward youngsters and of family disagreements.","The British constitution has always been puzzling and always will be.","For many, Christmas is also a time for coming together. But for others, service will come first.","I have in sincerity pledged myself to your service, as so many of you are pledged to mine. Throughout all my life and with all my heart I shall strive to be worthy of your trust.","It is easy enough to define what the Commonwealth is not.

Millions of others who never met her, but felt they knew her, will remember her.","At Christmas, I am always struck by how the spirit of togetherness lies also at the heart of the Christmas story.

It's so many different flavors and shades.","I made decisions that I regret, and I took them as learning experiences... I'm human, not perfect, like anybody else.","Every woman is a queen, and we all have different things to offer.","There are times you can't really see or even feel how sweet life can be. Hopefully its mountains will be higher than its valleys are deep. I know things that are broken can be fixed. Take the punch if you have to, hit the canvas and then get up again. Life is worth it.","A lot of people are crazy, cruel and negative. They got a little too much time on their hands to discuss everybody else. I have a limited amount of energy to blow in a day. I'd rather read something that I like or watch a program I enjoy or ride my damn motorcycle or throw back a couple of shots of tequila with my friends.","When I was around 18, I looked in the mirror and said, 'You're either going to love yourself or hate yourself.' And I decided to love myself. That changed a lot of things.","I lost relatives to AIDS. A couple of my closest cousins, favorite cousins. I lost friends to AIDS, high school friends who never even made it to their 21st birthdays in the '80s. When it's that close to you, you can't - you know, you can't really deny it, and you can't run from it.","I enjoy going to work and having a good time. It's tough when you got to work with people who just are in a bad mood all the damn time.","Anyone who knows me knows that I'm way more of a joker than I am a serious person.","Sometimes you do have to bank on yourself. You do have to believe in your ideas enough to really get out there and fight for it despite what people think of some young kids from the hood.","Hip-hop definitely taught me a lot. Having to create your own identity and become known and respected in a male-dominated field - it requires some guts. There are times you have to be strong, and times when you have to stand alone for what you believe in.","I am a strong woman with or without this other person, with or without this job, and with or without these tight pants.","I want every day to be life for the living, not just traipsing through it existing. I'm just interested in life and the world and exploring.","You can't let fear paralyze you. The worse that can happen is you fail, but guess what: You get up and try again. Feel that pain, get over it, get up, dust yourself off and keep it moving.","I've been giving back since I was a teen, handing out turkeys at Thanksgiving and handing out toys at toys drives for Christmas. It's very important to give back as a youth.

I kick out a lot of time and money wherever I can.","I don't have to take a trip around the world or be on a yacht in the Mediterranean to have happiness. I can find it in the little things, like looking out into my backyard and seeing deer in the fields.","Fear can be good when you're walking past an alley at night or when you need to check the locks on your doors before you go to bed, but it's not good when you have a goal and you're fearful of obstacles. We often get trapped by our fears, but anyone who has had success has failed before.","Look at people for an example, but then make sure to do things your way. Surround yourself with positive people.","I am not one to turn down macaroni and cheese, even late at night. I love Italian food. I love pasta... A refrigerator full of water and Gatorade? Honey, that's just not gonna happen.","The objectification of females is not a good thing! Not every rapper does this, but when the lyrics focus solely on the strip club, 'poppin' bottles' and how many girls they can 'tap,' it distorts what kids are learning. I think if there was more of a female presence in hip hop we could break up the monotony. It's all about balance.","I really don't know how to be anyone else, and whenever I try to be anyone else, I fail miserably. Or I disappoint myself. It doesn't build my self-esteem, and it doesn't help me grow me at all.","I feel like every woman is a queen, and we should be treated as such, and we should, you know, sort of request that sort of treatment from others.","Racism is ignorant. And it's stupid. And it's old. And it's played out. So beat it already with that, you know what I mean? 'Let's all get along' - I'm so tired of that damn sentence, but it's true.","If there are kids who want to follow in my footsteps, I'd say that my shoes are too big for them to fill! But their shoe size is just perfect.","I know a lot of people who really aren't beautiful because their attitudes are very nasty... Whether I make the 50 most beautiful list or not, I'm always going to feel like I'm number one most beautiful to myself... I get that from my mom, and my daddy and my friends who raised me.","If you try to follow everyone else's mold, you'll probably fail at some point because God created us uniquely for a reason.","Dreams become reality when we put our minds to it.","Bowling, I like bowling. I've been getting into this bowling thing. It's kinda fun.","How many crossroads are you allowed to have in life? I seem to have a lot of crossroads. I think maybe I crossed back across the same road too often.","Always follow your own path.","I have a drum set in my dressing room. I play drums to relax and have some fun.","I love riding, even if it's just my Vespa. You just zip and do your thing. I find there's a different awareness when I ride; it connects me to my senses and to God.","I would say I'm voluptuous. Statuesque. Definitely curvaceous.","I have my dad's shape. No booty.","There was always music in our home. My mom and my dad loved music. I remember when we were kids we would have these great parties at the house with congas and bongos and African drums, and it was amazing. It wasn't until years later that I found out that they were actually Black Panther meetings.","I have always felt strongly about empowering women. I'm living proof that, with confidence and by believing in yourself, you can accomplish any goal.","My legs are nice, my lips are shapely, and my breasts are pretty. They popped up when I was 11 and they weren't small then. I was teased, but now those kids wish they had what I have!","I think as far as the music industry is concerned, it's kind of been the wild, wild West in a way with the Internet, which is not necessarily a bad thing to me.","If my brother and I wanted money in our pockets, we had to get jobs - my first was at 15, at Burger King. We had to come up with ways to create an income.","Running for office was definitely something I've thought about. When I was younger, I wanted to major in political science. And I've been engaged in current events since I was a kid. If I can make a difference and feel passionately and capable, then I would. Why not?","I like Pirate's Booty. Prunes and olives, too. I love hummus. I can eat that until I die. I tend to eat mostly organic food.","I'm probably proudest of being able to lift a lot of us out of the 'hood. That's the biggest thing, that I've been able to employ a lot of people and give them opportunities.","If we focus on our health, including our inner health, our self-esteem, and how we look at ourselves and our confidence level, we'll tend to be healthier people anyway, we'll tend to make better choices for our lives, for our bodies, we'll always be trying to learn more, and get better as time goes on.","I was taught from a young age that many people would treat me as a second-class citizen because I was African-American and because I was female.","I lost relatives to AIDS, a couple of my closest cousins. I lost friends to AIDS, high-school friends who never even made it to their 21st birthdays in the '80s. When it's that close to you, you can't really deny it, and you can't run from it.","I don't have to really be in the 60s. Every time I hail a cab in New York, and they pass me by and pick up the white person, then I get a dose of it. Or when they don't want to take you to Harlem. I grew up with that.","I know people who are twice as creative as I am, twice as smart, but they didn't do anything because they feared going into a room and opening their mouths. My parents told me to truly accomplish things in my life, there would be times I would have to stand alone. It may be scary, but that's what it requires.","There are a lot of people who helped make Queen Latifah who she is today. I don't forget, but a lot of people do and get big heads. My mom will make me walk the dogs or take out the trash when I go home. I'm not allowed to get a big head; I've still got to do the simple things in life.","When I'm doing something I love, I can lose sleep. I can go and go and go and go. My work ethic is pretty intense. But when it comes to doing something that I don't love every day, I'm not very good at it. That's called work, and I don't like work that much.","A confident woman is a sexy woman, in my opinion. And I think guys find that to be the same way.","I often find it's just the confidence that makes you sexy, not what your body looks like. It's how you feel about yourself that makes you sexy.","Dolly Parton made me chicken and dumplings. That Tennessee woman can burn some pots! And we know that I am not necessarily shy to a fork!","Most people don't have so much talent that they can become a success all their own. We all need people to help us and lift us up.","I wish every woman would love herself and embrace what she was given naturally.","Having Black hair is unique in that Black women change up styles a lot. You can walk down one street block in New York City and see 10 different hairstyles that Black women are wearing: straight curls, short cuts, braids - we really run the gamut.","Two records put me over the top with hip-hop. One of them was 'Planet Rock,' and the other had no lyrics - it was called 'Numbers,' from a group called Kraftwerk. Every kid in the 'hood in New York and New Jersey was popping, locking, and breaking to that record. It was the hottest track on the street at the time.","You do silly things for love sometimes and not-so-smart things for love.","I often go to bed in my birthday suit. But I like teddies and cute little undies that match. I like a sexy bra and panty set, or little shorts.","Don't you want to know what's real and what's not? I remember when I was a kid, you know, this whole Cold War thing. They had us scared of the Russians. So, it's almost like, what's real and what's not?","I think I'd be a great mom, honestly. I don't think I'll have any problem giving them all the love in the world. Discipline will be the hard part.","There are a lot of people who helped make Queen Latifah who she is today. I don't forget, but a lot of people do and get big heads.","My mom will make me walk the dogs or take out the trash when I go home.","I'm not allowed to get a big head, I've still got to do the simple things in life.","I was baptized a Baptist, but I'm just Christian, as far as I'm concerned. I could go in any church, doesn't matter if it's Baptist, Protestant, Episcopal, or Catholic.","Sometimes I pray when I really feel like I need God to help me with something, and sometimes we just have conversations. We just kick it.","God is my homeboy. Jesus is my homeboy.","I never pictured myself as just a rapper; I always wanted to act and do whatever else I could do. I always felt like I could do a lot of different things.","To wanna be me is to go through not just the good but the bad. You wanna share my story identically? Man, you gonna take some lumps.","If you can draw something from my life that helps, more power to you.","I enjoy just being me. I don't need to be Queen Latifah, the brand, 24 hours a day.","New Jersey is a great place to live. And we have given some of the best talent to the world, from Jack Nicholson, John Travolta, to Jerry Lewis to Bon Jovi to Frank Sinatra.","I did Jay Leno with Mike the Situation, and he just - he lives, like, ten minutes from me in Jersey. He's like, 'If you ever get a flat, call me. I'll come fix your tire.' That's how we do. That's neighborly, you know?","I remember praying for peace all the time as a kid.","I realized there was racism because people thought, 'Oh, if you like roll 'n' roll, that makes you like a white kid.'","Business is fun. Controlling your own destiny is fun. Creating an idea and turning it into a movie; finding an artist and guiding their career and bringing them to some type of status - there's joy in that.","I have to be realistic about what I can and can't do. So whatever I do has to really be worth it. I like to master the things I do."],"Queen Rania of Jordan":["In education, technology can be a life-changer, a game changer, for kids who are both in school and out of school. Technology can bring textbooks to life. The Internet can connect students to their peers in other parts of the world. It can bridge the quality gaps.","A woman caring for her children; a woman striving to excel in the private sector; a woman partnering with her neighbors to make their street safer; a woman running for office to improve her country - they all have something to offer, and the more our societies empower women, the more we receive in return.","At the end of the day, the position is just a position, a title is just a title, and those things come and go. It's really your essence and your values that are important.","We shouldn't judge people through the prism of our own stereotypes.","Social media are a catalyst for the advancement of everyone's rights. It's where we're reminded that we're all human and all equal. It's where people can find and fight for a cause, global or local, popular or specialized, even when there are hundreds of miles between them.","To achieve a lasting peace in the Middle East takes guts, not guns.","My role models are people who can do things; I say to myself, 'I wish I could do that.'","Perhaps if we all subscribed to the African concept of Ubuntu - that we all become people through other people, and that we cannot be fully human alone, we could learn a lot. There'd be less hatred and more harmony.","I think generally, in life, I try to always ensure that there are periodic moments where I do venture out of my comfort zone, because that's what keeps you alive. That's what keeps you from getting stale.","Look at any country that's plagued with poverty, disease or violence; the antidote is girls. Girls are the antibodies to many of society's ills.","People sometimes think of 'queen' as a title that's shrouded with protocol and formality, and for that reason sometimes people are not easily saying what they want to say. They're reluctant to express their opinions, and I kind of find that frustrating because I want to know what people really, really think.","When you educate a girl, you kick-start a cycle of success. It makes economic sense. It makes social sense. It makes moral sense. But, it seems, it's not common sense yet.","When you deprive people of their right to live in dignity, to hope for a better future, to have control over their lives, when you deprive them of that choice, then you expect them to fight for these rights.","Learning to read and write changes lives; it means jobs, money, health, and dreams fulfilled.","Often times, we think of girls as soft and vulnerable. And we don't really think of them as possibly being the solutions to some of the world's toughest problems, but they really are.","I believe that if we want our children to understand the world beyond their classroom, we must bring the world into their classroom.","I work in areas related to child protection and family safety, women's empowerment, the creation of opportunities for youth, and culture and tourism. Daunting? Yes. Impossible? No. In fact, such challenges energize me.","When girls are educated, you get effects that cascade throughout society.","The more time goes on, the closer I am to the ground. I've been exposed to so many issues and people living under different pressures. It's helped me realize that a lot of glamorous things that people prioritize really don't matter.","I think that, as is the case offline, we should not be tolerant of hate speech, racist comments, or groups that promote hatred or intolerance in any shape or form.","Being queen is overrated.","By its very nature, hard-line ideology is self-serving and self-perpetuating; its primary goal is to survive - and that precludes everything.","Being popular comes when you have everything. But to be liked, it means that you must be treating people with respect and you must be showing kindness toward them.","For many, the hijab represents modesty, piety and devotion to God, and I truly respect that. But the hijab should not be used as a means of applying social pressure on people.","Of course democracy is good, but it is a process, not a prescription.","Eighty percent of my life is normal like any other mother. I worry about my children, if they're doing all right. I worry that my husband is doing well. The 20 percent is just the queen aspect that factors in. But for me, it's life as usual, and it's just taking care of my family.","It isn't often that the logic behind a policy is so clear. But when it comes to the value of educating girls, the evidence speaks for itself.","Holy scripture does not hold women back. It's the people that decide to interpret it in such a way for their own, sometimes political, agendas.","Role models can inspire. Campaigns can motivate. But if we want all girls everywhere to rise up, then we must find them, befriend them and support them.","Now and always, hard-line policy and those who embrace it are vessels for darker forces that are at once self-cannibalizing and combustible. No good can come of them. They are unsustainable because their sense of righteousness denies human worth.","The protocol things, the officialdom, are part of my work. But it doesn't take more than 20 percent of my time. The majority of my time I spend on issues that I care about.","If one girl with courage is a revolution, imagine what feats we can achieve together.","Tweeting is a very personal form of expression. Who else could talk about my son refusing to wear a suit to meet the Pope, my husband flying a helicopter, or take a twitpic from our home?","Well, my husband is supportive of my work, like advocating for dialogue between cultures on YouTube.","Twitter's a great way to tell people across the world what I care about and, hopefully, motivate them to join me in furthering my causes.","Eighty percent of my life is normal like any other mother. I worry about my children, if they're doing all right. I worry that my husband is doing well.","We're programmed to believe that time is the enemy, that it takes away from us or that it diminishes us. I have found that it's done the opposite to me. Life is in perfect balance. It's just that our perception of it isn't.","The average Jordanian has much in common with the average American in terms of the values that we share, the fact that we all value the family unit, our work ethic.","I feel that we don't have the luxury of asking whether or not the Palestinians and Israelis can achieve peace. I think we have to just ask the question of when and how.","Children who have an education grow up to lead healthier lives - earn higher income, take better care of their families, contribute to their economies.","I found that being online has opened a window for me to look into other people's lives... The greatest fear that I have is losing touch.","As a child I sometimes used to travel to the West Bank to visit my family, so I know what the checkpoints felt like. I knew what it was like to live under occupation.","I'd rather be dealt with as a person than a persona.","The United States was an innocent victim after September 11. It had never attacked or occupied Afghanistan. So therefore it had no choice but to go after the aggressors.","Religion and modernity are not necessarily mutually exclusive.","I'm amazed by the misconceptions about Muslim women and the Arab world that I hear, and that really does hurt me.","I've learned to take things a little more easily, to be a little more forgiving of myself.","Everybody's social life in Jordan revolves around family.","I think change needs to be egoless. It's not about my leaving my fingerprints or a legacy. It's more important to be part of a process by rolling up your sleeves, being on the ground, initiating projects, starting campaigns - you know, building stuff.","Maybe clothes are a form of creative expression for me. An outlet. Because I don't get to express myself creatively through my official duties.","Of course, I tweet. Tweeting is a very personal form of expression. Who else could talk about my son refusing to wear a suit to meet the Pope, my husband flying a helicopter, or take a twitpic from our home?","I really feel that political will is born out of popular will.","I'd rather be dealt with as a person than a persona. With my children, I'm just 'Mom.' At the end of the day, the position is just a position, a title is just a title, and those things come and go. It's really your essence and your values that are important.","We always say Jordan is not rich in natural resources - we don't have oil or gas like some of our neighbors do - but I think in terms of human resources, we are quite lucky and we are really trying to foster an environment of innovation and technology. I think Jordan will emerge as a center of innovation in the Middle East.","I have nothing against the veil. And I think that, wrongly, many in the West look at the veil as a symbol of oppression. Now, as long as a woman chooses to wear the veil, because that's her belief and because of her own - that's a personal relationship with God, so she should be free to dress in whichever way she wants.","I don't think people by nature are extremists. You will never find a population of extremists. Extremists have existed throughout the centuries on all religions. And what happens is, extremists start to have more leverage when the situation is bad.","I want to be that person who could sacrifice everything for others.","We need another revolution in the Arab world. We need an education revolution. If there's one thing we need to focus on, it's redesigning our educational systems."],"Queen Victoria":["We are not interested in the possibilities of defeat. They do not exist.","Great events make me quiet and calm; it is only trifles that irritate my nerves.","The important thing is not what they think of me, but what I think of them.","The Queen is most anxious to enlist everyone in checking this mad, wicked folly of 'Women's Rights'. It is a subject which makes the Queen so furious that she cannot contain herself.","I feel sure that no girl would go to the altar if she knew all.","I would venture to warn against too great intimacy with artists as it is very seductive and a little dangerous.","I think people really marry far too much; it is such a lottery after all, and for a poor woman a very doubtful happiness.","For a man to strike any women is most brutal, and I, as well as everyone else, think this far worse than any attempt to shoot, which, wicked as it is, is at least more comprehensible and more courageous.","An ugly baby is a very nasty object - and the prettiest is frightful.","Being pregnant is an occupational hazard of being a wife.","I don't dislike babies, though I think very young ones rather disgusting.","A marriage is no amusement but a solemn act, and generally a sad one.","Being married gives one one's position like nothing else can.","Everybody grows but me.","When I think of a merry, happy, free young girl - and look at the ailing, aching state a young wife generally is doomed to - which you can't deny is the penalty of marriage."],"Quentin Blake":["Going to hospital is rather like going to an alien planet.","As an illustrator you need to understand the human body - but having looked at and understood nature, you must develop an ability to look away and capture the balance between what you've seen and what you imagine.","You see, I don't draw from life at all, but I do look out of my window a lot.","With my pictures, what I hope is that it encourages the reader to imagine more pictures of his own.","Guinea pigs are quite difficult to draw, I think, because they're so furry.","I suppose illustration tends to live in the streets, rather than in the hermetically sealed atmosphere of the museum, and consequently it has come to be taken less seriously.","I don't have anything interesting to conceal or reveal in my private life, and it is really only my work and professional life that I want to talk about.","I do like children, but only as people. Not as if they're a special category.","I don't think there's an illustrator who's as good as a Titian or a Rembrandt... but then, Rembrandt was a bit of an illustrator on the quiet, you know?","I love the sea, but I avoid any sort of seaside resort that has skyscrapers or seaside entertainments.","I don't like leaving work behind. I hate the idea that something might be happening on the drawing board at home that I am going to miss.","Inspiration is some mysterious blessing which happens when the wheels are turning smoothly.","I'm trained as a teacher; that's the only thing I've got a certificate for.","Television is kind of a disappointment. I often want to watch it, but I find it quite hard - I don't like soaps, reality TV or celebrity chefs.","I find that I can't work and listen to radio - either I find I don't like it and it distracts me, or I do like it and I want to listen to it.","I have an assistant who's very good at email, so I don't struggle with it.","I've never quite worked out how to do holidays. I've got a house in France which I suppose is a kind of holiday house. But it's really only so I can go on drawing when I get there. I'm never far away from the feeling that I want to be getting on with something.","I know some children's writers write for specific children, or for the children they once were, but I never have. I just thought children might like my sort of visual humour.","It was an accident of circumstance that I never married.","Well, one always has an instinct to be a painter, and I've done quite a lot of painting at one time or another, though not with any public success.","I draw every day - unless I'm being interviewed.","Being positive may be a character defect of mine.","I think it is the fact that birds are two-legged, like us, which gives them something of our balance and gesture and makes them nearer to us.","I don't feel as if I belong to an age group.","A lot of my travel is at least partly work, visiting schools and libraries, especially in France.","The hateful thing about most hotels nowadays is that they only have duvets. I hate duvets.","Sometimes I think people get into trouble because they can't say what they want to.","Sometimes people think drawing and painting is mucking about when actually it is a highly skilled activity.","If you want to read and you want to draw, that helps you to express yourself.","I think it is important for children to read different things to find out about their emotions and other people's emotions. It is an enormous source of education and culture."],"Quentin Bryce":["Maternity leave and parental leave is absolutely vital for strengthening families. It's an issue for men and women.","For a very long time now I've been saying to young women, 'You can have it all, but not all at the same time.' How important it is to take very good care of yourself, of your mental and physical and spiritual wellbeing; it's hard to do. It's easier to be a workaholic than to have a truly balanced life.","The aboriginal women leaders of Papunya - the Papunya Artists - performed a dance for me: the Honey Ant dance. They'd never done it for anyone else. They honoured me with a ceremonial stick that signifies the story of the land.","I think there's a very clear recognition and understanding that the progress of women in business at the very highest decision-making levels is too slow. This is a discussion that's going on in every country around the world, actually.","Livelihoods and whole communities throughout the Murray-Darling Basin have been imperilled by the workings of drought, fire, flood, acid mud and human action over many decades. In the rescues and the cleanups and the long hauls, I see the same attitude over and again. People just rally and get on with it.","I've never owned a pair of jeans, but I had a fantastic denim boiler-suit and it got a lot of wearing.","I believe the old boys' network is a powerful one. No one gives up power and privilege willingly, do they?","We all go back to our roots. My father went to the central west, went to Ilfracombe in 1919. He was the manager of the wool scour there. And, Ilfracombe was right at the heart of Australia's great wool industry, and my mother was a teacher at Winton.","My mother played the piano and my father the violin, I can remember my dad teaching me how to waltz; I had my feet on his, my mother playing the piano, and my husband will tell you the lessons weren't very successful.","I didn't have any Indigenous friends until I was in my 30s, and I'll always remember and be inspired by the remarkable friendship I had with Connie Bush, an outstanding Indigenous leader from Groot Eylandt on who was on the National Women's Advisory Council with me.","The bonds that women share around the world, wherever we come from, they're very powerful and they have an ease of communication because we share those very important things of our families, our mothering, of improving opportunities for the next generation.","I think we have to keep working enormously hard to see that every single Indigenous child - every Australian child - has true equality of opportunity. We've got to work harder at it. I think, you know, the heartland issue for us is the gap; the gap in life expectancy in this country.","I think that young Australians ought to be taking language education much more seriously. I mean, you know, every day I'm meeting people with expertise, ability and talent in fields where I want to learn so much more; science, for example.","It's a great privilege and an honour to have the experiences and opportunities that I do to meet extraordinary Australians right across our country who share a great generosity of spirit.","One of the most enjoyable things I do at Government House and when I travel around Australia is to talk with children. I tell them about our parliamentary democracy - and I often do that as I'm walking into an Executive Council meeting next door!","The thing we often forget to talk about, or perhaps we take for granted, is our country's dazzling beauty. Our natural environment is so much a part of Australia's art, writing, music and culture, both indigenous and non indigenous.","I support affirmative action. I support special measures when you need it.","The Australian way of affirmative action is setting goals and recognising discrimination and lack of opportunity and deciding to take action and setting some goals and targets. I guess I prefer that language to talking about quotas.","All women need support when they're having their babies and their little families are in formation. I have to say I have a lot of concern about the numbers of women - and men, now - who are not getting the support that they need. There are not the families and the communities around that there used to be."],"Quentin Crisp":["It is explained that all relationships require a little give and take. This is untrue. Any partnership demands that we give and give and give and at the last, as we flop into our graves exhausted, we are told that we didn't give enough.","In an expanding universe, time is on the side of the outcast. Those who once inhabited the suburbs of human contempt find that without changing their address they eventually live in the metropolis.","There is no need to do any housework at all. After the first four years the dirt doesn't get any worse.","Decency must be an even more exhausting state to maintain than its opposite. Those who succeed seem to need a stupefying amount of sleep.","If at first you don't succeed, failure may be your style.","Sex is the last refuge of the miserable.","For an introvert his environment is himself and can never be subject to startling or unforeseen change.","When I told the people of Northern Ireland that I was an atheist, a woman in the audience stood up and said, 'Yes, but is it the God of the Catholics or the God of the Protestants in whom you don't believe?","Nothing more rapidly inclines a person to go into a monastery than reading a book on etiquette. There are so many trivial ways in which it is possible to commit some social sin.","The consuming desire of most human beings is deliberately to plant their whole life in the hands of some other person. I would describe this method of searching for happiness as immature. Development of character consists solely in moving toward self-sufficiency.","It's no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying, 'Really, I was meant to be a ballet dancer.' By then, pigs will be your style.","The young always have the same problem - how to rebel and conform at the same time. They have now solved this by defying their parents and copying one another.","I recommend limiting one's involvement in other people's lives to a pleasantly scant minimum.","The very purpose of existence is to reconcile the glowing opinion we hold of ourselves with the appalling things that other people think about us.","However low a man sinks he never reaches the level of the police.","Fashion is what you adopt when you don't know who you are.","You fall out of your mother's womb, you crawl across open country under fire, and drop into your grave.","An autobiography is an obituary in serial form with the last installment missing.","The formula for achieving a successful relationship is simple: you should treat all disasters as if they were trivialities but never treat a triviality as if it were a disaster.","Health consists of having the same diseases as one's neighbors.","Never keep up with the Joneses. Drag them down to your level.","Love is not enough. It must be the foundation, the cornerstone - but not the complete structure. It is much too pliable, too yielding.","It is not the simple statement of facts that ushers in freedom; it is the constant repetition of them that has this liberating effect. Tolerance is the result not of enlightenment, but of boredom.","To know all is not to forgive all. It is to despise everybody.","Life was a funny thing that happened to me on the way to the grave.","Is not the whole world a vast house of assignation of which the filing system has been lost?","Men get laid, but women get screwed.","There are three reasons for becoming a writer: the first is that you need the money; the second that you have something to say that you think the world should know; the third is that you can't think what to do with the long winter evenings.","The trouble with children is that they're not returnable.","I simply haven't the nerve to imagine a being, a force, a cause which keeps the planets revolving in their orbits and then suddenly stops in order to give me a bicycle with three speeds.","For flavor, instant sex will never supersede the stuff you have to peel and cook.","Nothing shortens a journey so pleasantly as an account of misfortunes at which the hearer is permitted to laugh.","Though intelligence is powerless to modify character, it is a dab hand at finding euphemisms for its weaknesses.","The poverty from which I have suffered could be diagnosed as 'Soho' poverty. It comes from having the airs and graces of a genius and no talent.","Vice is its own reward. It is virtue which, if it is to be marketed with consumer appeal, must carry Green Shield stamps.","Euphemisms are unpleasant truths wearing diplomatic cologne.","My mother protected me from the world and my father threatened me with it.","The law is simply expediency wearing a long white dress.","Manners are love in a cool climate.","Living en famille provides the strongest motives for rudeness combined with the maximum opportunity for displaying it.","Abatement in the hostility of one's enemies must never be thought to signify they have been won over. It only means that one has ceased to constitute a threat.","The British do not expect happiness. I had the impression, all the time that I lived there, that they do not want to be happy; they want to be right."],"Quentin Tarantino":["When I make a film, I am hoping to reinvent the genre a little bit. I just do it my way. I make my own little Quentin versions of them... I consider myself a student of cinema. It's almost like I am going for my professorship in cinema, and the day I die is the day I graduate. It is a lifelong study.","When people ask me if I went to film school I tell them, 'no, I went to films.'","Violence is one of the most fun things to watch.","I don't believe in elitism. I don't think the audience is this dumb person lower than me. I am the audience.","If you just love movies enough, you can make a good one.","A writer should have this little voice inside of you saying, Tell the truth. Reveal a few secrets here.","I'm a big collector of vinyl - I have a record room in my house - and I've always had a huge soundtrack album collection. So what I do, as I'm writing a movie, is go through all those songs, trying to find good songs for fights, or good pieces of music to layer into the film.","Dogs got personality. Personality goes a long way.","Movies are my religion and God is my patron. I'm lucky enough to be in the position where I don't make movies to pay for my pool. When I make a movie, I want it to be everything to me; like I would die for it.","CGI has fully ruined car crashes. Because how can you be impressed with them now? When you watch them in the '70s, it was real cars, real metal, real blasts. They're really doing it and risking their lives. But I knew CGI was gonna start taking over.","I want to have the fun of doing anime and I love anime, but I can't do storyboards because I can't really draw and that's what they live and die on.","I've always wanted to work with Warren Beatty.","If I wasn't a film-maker, I'd be a film critic. It's the only thing I'd be qualified to do.","I've always thought John Travolta is one of the greatest movie stars Hollywood has ever produced.","To me, movies and music go hand in hand. When I'm writing a script, one of the first things I do is find the music I'm going to play for the opening sequence.","I steal from every movie ever made.","I have loved movies as the number one thing in my life so long that I can't ever remember a time when I didn't.","Trying to make a feature film yourself with no money is the best film school you can do.","The good ideas will survive.","I want to top expectations. I want to blow you away.","Truth be told, actually, my favorite director of the Movie Brats was not Scorsese. Loved him. But my favorite director of the Movie Brats was Brian de Palma. I actually met De Palma right after I'd done 'Reservoir Dogs,' and I was very beside myself.","My plan is to have a theatre in some small town or something and I'll be manager. Ill be the crazy old movie guy.","I got into Facebook late, and I think if you get into Facebook late, you tend to use it the right way, as opposed to the people who got into it sooner and friended everybody and now have a thousand friends. I keep it at about 80 or so, and they're all people I know. Just because I do a movie doesn't mean I friend everybody in it.","One of the privileges you have of living the life of an artist and creating your own world and everything is the fact that, in-between times, you can kind of spend them however you want. Because, you know, once you open up your candy store again, you're open for business. And you have to be responsible. You have to be available.","I was kind of excited about going to jail the first time and I learnt some great dialogue.","When I'm doing a movie, I'm not doing anything else. It's all about the movie. I don't have a wife. I don't have a kid. Nothing can get in my way... I've made a choice, so far, to go on this road alone. Because this is my time. This is my time to make movies.","I don't believe you should stay onstage until people are begging you to get off. I like the idea of leaving them wanting a bit more.","I couldn't spell anything. I couldn't remember anything, but I could go to a movie and I knew who starred in it, who directed it, everything.","When I'm writing something, I try not to get analytical about it as I'm doing it, as I'm writing it.","I loved history because to me, history was like watching a movie.","It's very important that every movie I do makes money because I want the people that had the faith in me to get their money back.","Australian genre films were a lot of fun because they were legitimate genre movies. They were real genre films, and they dealt, in a way like the Italians did, with the excess of genre, and that has been an influence on me.","Something stopped me in school a little bit. Anything that I'm not interested in, I can't even feign interest.","My movies are painfully personal, but I'm never trying to let you know how personal they are. It's my job to make it be personal, and also to disguise that so only I or the people who know me know how personal it is. 'Kill Bill' is a very personal movie.","I'm not a Hollywood basher because enough good movies come out of the Hollywood system every year to justify its existence, without any apologies.","All my movies are achingly personal.","'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is not really my thing, but I kind of loved it.","I think we spent 60-something million on 'Hateful Eight,' which is actually more than I wanted to spend, but we had weather problems. And I wanted to make it good.","I come from a mixed family, where my mother is art house cinema and my father is B-movie genre cinema. They're estranged, and I've been trying to bring them together for all of my career to one degree or another.","I have a lot of Chinese fans who buy my movies on the street and watch them, and I'm OK with it. I'm not OK with it in other places, but if the government's going to censor me, then I want the people to see it in any way they can.","I want to have more original-screenplay Oscars than anybody who's ever lived! So much, I want to have so many that - four is enough. And do it within ten films, all right, so that when I die, they rename the original-screenplay Oscar 'the Quentin.' And everybody's down with that.","Digital presentation is just television in public; we're all just getting together and watching TV without pointing the remote control at the screen.","Novelists have always had complete freedom to pretty much tell their story any way they saw fit. And that's what I'm trying to do.","If I really considered myself a writer, I wouldn't be writing screenplays. I'd be writing novels.","I wasn't trying to top Pulp Fiction with Jackie Brown. I wanted to go underneath it and make a more modest character study movie.","I want do a Mandarin language movie. It'll probably be the next movie I do after the one I do next.","I don't think Pulp Fiction is hard to watch at all.","I actually think one of my strengths is my storytelling.","I am a genre lover - everything from spaghetti western to samurai movie.","I do feel that I need to do at least one more Western - I think you need to make three Westerns to call yourself a Western director.","I want to write novels, and I want to write and direct theater.","It's a standard staple in Japanese cinema to cut somebody's arm off and have red water hoses for veins, spraying blood everywhere.","I'm a historian in my own mind.","To me, America is just another market.","To be a novelist, all I need is a pen and a piece of paper.","Sergio Leone was a big influence on me because of the spaghetti westerns.","Reservoir Dogs is a small film, and part of its charm was that it was a small film. I'd probably make it for $3 million now so I'd have more breathing room.","My parents said, Oh, he's going to be a director someday. I wanted to be an actor.","My mom took me to see Carnal Knowledge and The Wild Bunch and all these kind of movies when I was a kid.","Movies are not about the weekend that they're released, and in the grand scheme of things, that's probably the most unimportant time of a film's life.","I've always thought my soundtracks do pretty good, because they're basically professional equivalents of a mix tape I'd make for you at home.","I've always considered myself a filmmaker who writes stuff for himself to do.","I'm very happy with the way I write. I think I do it good. But I've never really considered myself a writer.","I love Elmore Leonard. To me, True Romance is basically like an Elmore Leonard movie.","I like it when somebody tells me a story, and I actually really feel that that's becoming like a lost art in American cinema.","I always do an all-night horror marathon on Saturdays where we start at seven and go until five in the morning.","Everything I learned as an actor, I have basically applied to writing.","As a viewer, the minute I start getting confused, I check out of the movie. Emotionally, I'm severed.","If there is something magic about the collaborations I have with actors it's because I put the character first.","I look at 'Death Proof' and realize I had too much time.","L.A. is so big that if you don't actually live in Hollywood, you might as well be from a different planet.","I cannot get myself interested in video games. I've been given video game players and they just sit there connected to my TVs gathering dust until eventually I unplug them so I can put in another special-region DVD player.","I just grew up watching a lot of movies. I'm attracted to this genre and that genre, this type of story, and that type of story. As I watch movies I make some version of it in my head that isn't quite what I'm seeing - taking the things I like and mixing them with stuff I've never seen before.","I don't really consider myself an American filmmaker like, say, Ron Howard might be considered an American filmmaker. If I'm doing something and it seems to me to be reminiscent of an Italian giallo, I'm gonna to do it like an Italian giallo.","I have an idea for a Godzilla movie that I've always wanted to do. The whole idea of Godzilla's role in Tokyo, where he's always battling these other monsters, saving humanity time and again - wouldn't Godzilla become God? It would be called 'Living Under the Rule of Godzilla.'","I will never do 'Pulp Fiction 2,' but having said that, I could very well do other movies with these characters.","In the '50s, audiences accepted a level of artifice that the audiences in 1966 would chuckle at. And the audiences of 1978 would chuckle at what the audience of 1966 said was okay, too. The trick is to try to be way ahead of that curve, so they're not chuckling at your movies 20 years down the line.","If you go out and see a lot of movies in a given year, it's really hard to come up with a top ten, because you saw a lot of stuff that you liked. A top 20 is easier. You probably get one masterpiece a year, and I don't think you should expect more than one masterpiece a year, except in a really great year."],"Questlove":["I don't have friends, and it's hard for me to make new friends. Right now, the people that are in my life are the people that I work with.","Hip-hop is so much about character and caricature that people just see you as a character. Very rarely are you flesh and bone to people.","Highlight reels are about that one person. After a barrage of highlight reels, you get the sense that you can do it without a team. But music thrived the most when groups were involved. People lose sight of that - that community makes the world run.","I've come to the conclusion that the average person can do about four things a day, like four real things a day.","I think the music comes first, then comes the fashion, and thus, the lifestyle. I believe it starts with music, and then the person delivering it delivers the lifestyle, the fashion. Madonna is a great example of that.","According to my parents, I just started drumming when I was two. I traveled with them from five to seven on the road, playing percussion. Between 8 and 12, my dad sort of prepared me by teaching me every aspect of road life.","My first gig was at Radio City Music Hall when I was 13.","I believe that the only people who really, truly benefit from any of the policies of Republicans are the wealthy. I'm in that 1 percent tax bracket, but I'm not a man of wealth.","Classical music requires an immense amount of concentration, and I don't know if I would've been that committed to that particular life.","I prefer to unwind by DJing. I learned that from Mike D from the Beastie Boys. After a show, he would DJ. Once I saw that, I wanted to do that. And now DJing is like my lifeline. I love the power it represents.","I have a lot of those 'Forrest Gump,' I-was-there moments.","You know the greatest thing about working on 'Fallon?' I get so many anonymous gifts.","During the 2008 election, I made clear to the Obama campaign that I don't think it's wise for me to force my personal political agenda on anyone.","I'm not one of those people who's so blinded by my own work and my sweat. It's kind of risky writing a memoir when you're really part of a larger universe.","In the 2000s, I became an artist. I started preserving and educating. I became more obsessed with making iPod playlists for people.","My parents were really strict about me not watching cartoons.","The president is just the coach of a football team. You need the right support, the right stadium, the right players, the right staff. An excellent coach is not going to win games.","Hip-hop is such a disposable art form from a business standpoint. It never treats its artists as art; it never treats its product as art.","I'm a 24-hour tweet machine, I'm a 24-hour blogger. When there's no pressure on me, I can talk and write and lecture with the best of them. But put a deadline on me and I start getting writer's block.","In terms of being a 'sneakerhead,' there was one point where I was obsessively following every sneaker blog. That's the beauty of Twitter: To get the heads up on what's coming out.","I would love to have some sort of 'Back To The Future' Delorean time machine travel device so I could go back to 1981 to see that very first Jackson 5 concert I went to, back when I was a kid.","Hip-hop is an instant gratification, winners and losers circle, and often those who are losing give up after three or four, five years.","I do secret stand-up shows around New York. I announce and tweet this to nobody - I get onstage and I do a quick five minutes.","I want the 'Roots' biopic to be animated - I see Charles Schulz drawing us. I think it would be more hilarious with the voices of children."],"Quiara Alegria Hudes":["I'm half Puerto Rican and half Jewish and so, in some ways, living in many worlds at once is where I feel most at home.","The best way for me to procrastinate as a writer is research.","I love writing. It makes me so happy.","I'll kind of get interested in a subject and I won't know why. It'll be in my head for many years and I'll say, 'Do I know enough here to research?'","I love researching, I love interviewing.","I am myself of a mixed background."],"Quico Canseco":["There has to be so many other ways of approaching airline security than demeaning ourselves by giving up a lot of our dignities and our liberty to do this.","It should not be the government running the economy."],"Quincy Jones":["A great song can make a terrible singer sound good, but a good singer - you put a great song on top of that, you're really in great shape!","Every day, my daddy told me the same thing. 'Once a task is just begun, never leave it till it's done. Be the labour great or small, do it well or not at all.'","I guess hip-hop has been closer to the pulse of the streets than any music we've had in a long time. It's sociology as well as music, which is in keeping with the tradition of black music in America.","Playing the game, and unfortunately, playing the gangster game is very profitable.","If architecture is frozen music then music must be liquid architecture.","I lost my mother when I was 7 and they put her in a mental hospital. My brother and I watched her being taken away in a strait jacket. That's something you never forget. And my stepmother was like in the movie 'Precious.' I couldn't handle it. So I said to myself, 'I don't have a mother. I don't need one. I'm going to let music be my mother.'","Imagine what a harmonious world it could be if every single person, both young and old shared a little of what he is good at doing.","When I was 13, I started working in a nightclub with Ray Charles. That's the greatest school in the world, the school of the streets. Ray taught me how to read in Braille. He was only two years older than me, but it was like he was 100 years older.","Melody is king, and don't you ever forget it. Lyrics appear to be out front, but they're not; they're just an accompanying factor. If they're good, you're really in good shape. Lyrics are written to be rewritten.","You make your mistakes to learn how to get to the good stuff.","I'd been in love before - I was always in love.","I tell my kids and I tell proteges, always have humility when you create and grace when you succeed, because it's not about you. You are a terminal for a higher power. As soon as you accept that, you can do it forever.","I was raised in Chicago and I guess that was one of the special breeding grounds for gangsters of all colors. That was the Detroit of the gangster world. The car industry was thugs.","I have all the tools and gadgets. I tell my son, who's a producer, 'You never work for the machine; the machine works for you.'","I only hope that one day, America will recognize what the rest of the world already has known, that our indigenous music - gospel, blues, jazz and R&B - is the heart and soul of all popular music; and that we cannot afford to let this legacy slip into obscurity, I'm telling you.","Without the Fender bass, there'd be no rock n' roll or no Motown. The electric guitar had been waiting 'round since 1939 for a nice partner to come along. It became an electric rhythm section, and that changed everything.","We were in the heart of the ghetto in Chicago during the Depression, and every block - it was probably the biggest black ghetto in America - every block also is the spawning ground practically for every gangster, black and white, in America too.","I've never been bored in my life, man. I've never been bored or lonely. Are you kidding? No way! I'm an orchestrator, a musician, a producer. I love everything. I've studied languages from Farsi to Greek to French, Swedish, Russian... How can you get bored?","I started imagining this whole different world. It was a society of musicians, a family I hoped I could belong to one day.","Young people should travel, and they don't. You can't know if you don't go.","I found this out over the years, that racism is a thinly veiled disguise over economics and money. It really is.","You cannot get an A if you're afraid of getting an F.","I never cared about money or fame, and I don't care now. I follow the groove, and money always follows.","Cherish your mistakes, and you won't keep making them over and over again. It's the same with heartbreaks and girls and everything else. Cherish them, and they'll put some wealth in you.","Arts is just as important as military defense, you know? Emotional defense is just as important.","I'm just a musician and a record producer.","Everybody has their idiosyncrasies.","Bebop and hip-hop, in so many ways, they're connected. A lot of rappers remind me so much of bebop guys in terms of improvisation, beats and rhymes. My dream is to see hip-hop incorporated in education. You've got the youth of the world in the palm of your hand.","I believe that a hundred years from now, when people look back at the 20th century, they will look at Miles, Bird, Clifford Brown, Ella and Dizzy, among elders as our Mozarts, our Chopins, our Bachs and Beethovens.","I believe in astrology as much as I do in genetics.","To me it's no accident that all the symphony orchestras around the world tune up to the note A. And A is 440 cycles, except in Germany where it's 444. But the universe is 450 cycles. So what I'm trying to say is, I think it's God's voice, melody especially. Counterpoint, retrograde inversion, harmony... that's the science and the craft.","Every country can be defined through their food, their music and their language. That's the soul of a country.","I was married for 36 years but now I'm free.","Music in movies is all about dissonance and consonance, tension and release.","Few rappers realize the genre sprang from West African griots through Delta slave songs to jazz poetry and the comedic trash talk of 'the dozens.'","After every war, there was a significant change in the music, and I can understand how that happened. If you participate in protecting the country, you think you can be part of it, but you come back home and it's worse than ever.","I'm Pisces with Leo rising. The Pisces part is the dreamer. The Leo says, 'Let's execute.'","Working with kids in Soweto in South Africa, it's rough out there. But the bottom line is you've got to go to know. In Cambodia, there are 10,000 landmines. Same in Afghanistan, same in Colombia. I'm totally addicted to traveling.","I'm probably the only one in the world you can name that's worked with Billie Holiday, Louie Armstrong, Ella, Duke, Miles, Dizzy, Ray Charles, Aretha, Michael Jackson, rappers. 'Fly Me to the Moon' was played on the moon by Buzz Aldrin. Sinatra. Paul Simon. Tony Bennett. I'm the only one.","I never felt like I had a mother.","Seattle is like a global gumbo, a melting pot with all kinds of people - the rich, the poor, white people, some Chinese, Filipino, Jewish and black people - they're all here.","I got in the school band and the school choir. It all hit me like a ton of bricks, everything just came out. I played percussion for a while, and stayed after school forever just tinkering around with different things, the clarinets and the violins.","All guys get into music because they love music and they also want to get the girls.","I like all music. The only music I don't like is bad music.","Sidney Poitier and Sidney Lumet were instrumental in helping me get started as the first black composer to get name credit for movie scores.","I was reading Omar Khayyam, Kahlil Gibran, Rumi, L. Ron Hubbard, all sorts of philosophy. Bebop cats are like that. Curious. I wanted to know about everything.","After I learned the piano, I went on to learn percussion, the tuba, b-flat baritone, French horn, trombone, trumpet, most of the instruments in the orchestra. Trumpet was my instrument.","I got a scholarship to Seattle University and I was writing arrangements for singers and everybody. But the music course was too dry and I really wanted to get away from home.","I was inspired by a lot of people when I was young. Every band that came through town, to the theater, or the dance hall. I was at every dance, every night club, listened to every band that came through, because in those days we didn't have MTV, we didn't have television.","I went with Lionel Hampton for three years. Out of that came a trip to Europe.","If you started in New York you were dealing with the biggest guys in the world. You're dealing with Charlie Parker and all the big bands and everything. We got more experience working in Seattle.","It slaps your dignity just right. I loved the idea of these proud, dignified black men, and I saw the older ones wounded, and it wounded me ten times as much because I couldn't stand seeing them hurt like this.","It's amazing how much trouble you can get in when you don't have anything else to do.","It's easy to get next to music theory, especially between your peers and music classes and so forth. You just pay attention. I had a good ear, so I realized that printed music was just about reminding you what to play.","Just blow in it and sound bad for about a year and then make it sound a little bit better, and you get a little band together, and then you get a few jobs. You take four guys that sound half bad, but if they're 25 percent each, they can give 100 percent, you know?","My father was a carpenter, a very good carpenter. He also worked for the Jones boys. They were not family members, we weren't related at all. They started the policy racket in Chicago, and they had the five and dime store.","We got into all the trouble you could ever imagine. We figured that if the Jones boys and all the gangsters ran Chicago, we had our own territory now. All the stores, all the crime, we were in charge of everything, my stepbrother and my brother.","We spent most of our life almost like street rats just running around the street until we were ten years old.","We stole a box of honey jars one time and went out in the woods and took care of the whole box. I don't think I touched honey again for 20 years. I never wanted to see honey again.","When I was about five or seven years old my mother was placed in a mental institution and so we were with our father who worked very hard, and we had to figure a lot of things out.","When I was 14, I was a passenger in a terrible accident.","The climate in the '50s and '60s for black performers or black people in the entertainment business was atrocious. It was atrocious.","I'm not a psychiatrist.","I've met every freak in the business.","I'm a great believer in letting lyrics just flow out, wherever they come from.","I don't remember feeling love.","My grandmother had this high-tech security system - a rusty nail she used to lock the door.","My earliest memories are being pinned to a fence with a switchblade.","I was the most subtle person in the world.","I'm never in my life going to do a record that's a tribute to myself. I don't need it.","China's got a billion people and a hit record over there is a million records. You know that ain't right.","My son is a hip-hop producer.","I'm a tremendous believer and supporter in hip-hop and rap.","Frank Sinatra took me to a whole new planet. I worked with him until he passed away in '98. He left me his ring. I never take it off. Now, when I go to Sicily, I don't need a passport. I just flash my ring.","I didn't understand key signatures or anything, you know. I'd say silly things at the top of a trumpet part like, 'Note, when you play B naturals, make the B naturals a half step lower because they sound funny if they're B naturals.' And some guy said: 'Idiot, just put a flat on the third line and it's a key signature, you know?'","Everybody, no matter what vocation they're looking at, should add music as an essential to their curriculum. Music can be a very important part of your soul and your growth as a human being. It's so powerful.","I don't ever want to grow up. That's boring.","When you work with Ray Charles, Billy Eckstine and Frank Sinatra, and you tell them to jump without a net, you better know what you're talking about. Thank God I was ready for it."],"Quinn Shephard":["The tutor gave us our work, and if we had trouble, she'd help us on it, but we were really only working on the stuff that our school gave us - well, I was, because I go to a public school.","I'd like mostly stuff for design, because I like to design clothing.","My mom had done some TV and commercials before I was born, and so when I was born, she knew I had a really big interest in acting because I was always acting in plays with my dolls, and they were sort of boring, because I've seen them on tape; they always involved a lot of singing and dragging them around by their hair."],"Quintilian":["The perfection of art is to conceal art.","A liar should have a good memory.","In almost everything, experience is more valuable than precept.","It is fitting that a liar should be a man of good memory.","While we are making up our minds as to when we shall begin, the opportunity is lost.","As regards parents, I should like to see them as highly educated as possible, and I do not restrict this remark to fathers alone.","We must form our minds by reading deep rather than wide.","It is the nurse that the child first hears, and her words that he will first attempt to imitate.","We excuse our sloth under the pretext of difficulty.","A laugh, if purchased at the expense of propriety, costs too much.","It is much easier to try one's hand at many things than to concentrate one's powers on one thing.","Whilst we deliberate how to begin a thing, it grows too late to begin it.","Everything that has a beginning comes to an end.","It is worth while too to warn the teacher that undue severity in correcting faults is liable at times to discourage a boy's mind from effort.","The mind is exercised by the variety and multiplicity of the subject matter, while the character is moulded by the contemplation of virtue and vice.","Forbidden pleasures alone are loved immoderately; when lawful, they do not excite desire.","He who speaks evil only differs from his who does evil in that he lacks opportunity.","Men, even when alone, lighten their labors by song, however rude it may be.","To my mind the boy who gives least promise is one in whom the critical faculty develops in advance of the imagination.","The gifts of nature are infinite in their variety, and mind differs from mind almost as much as body from body.","The pretended admission of a fault on our part creates an excellent impression.","That which prematurely arrives at perfection soon perishes.","Vain hopes are like certain dreams of those who wake.","Nothing is more dangerous to men than a sudden change of fortune.","Our minds are like our stomaches; they are whetted by the change of their food, and variety supplies both with fresh appetite.","It seldom happens that a premature shoot of genius ever arrives at maturity.","Where evil habits are once settled, they are more easily broken than mended.","God, that all-powerful Creator of nature and architect of the world, has impressed man with no character so proper to distinguish him from other animals, as by the faculty of speech.","To swear, except when necessary, is becoming to an honorable man.","The prosperous can not easily form a right idea of misery.","A laugh costs too much when bought at the expense of virtue.","For it would have been better that man should have been born dumb, nay, void of all reason, rather than that he should employ the gifts of Providence to the destruction of his neighbor.","Fear of the future is worse than one's present fortune.","While we are examining into everything we sometimes find truth where we least expected it.","Those who wish to appear wise among fools, among the wise seem foolish.","Though ambition in itself is a vice, yet it is often the parent of virtues.","Without natural gifts technical rules are useless.","Consequently the student who is devoid of talent will derive no more profit from this work than barren soil from a treatise on agriculture.","For the mind is all the easier to teach before it is set.","When defeat is inevitable, it is wisest to yield.","Verse satire indeed is entirely our own.","Though ambition itself be a vice, yet it is often times the cause of virtues.","When we cannot hope to win, it is an advantage to yield.","Nature herself has never attempted to effect great changes rapidly."],"Quinton Aaron":["If I have to degrade myself or do something that I'm not willing to do as a Christian to get something, I'm just not willing to do it.","I like to be someone else.
