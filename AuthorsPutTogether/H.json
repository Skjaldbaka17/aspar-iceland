Then my first day at Penn I went right to the 'Daily Pennsylvanian' and pretty much spent most of my college career working both as the sports editor and then editor of the editorial page.","Why did I become a writer? Because I grew up in New York City, and there were seven newspapers in New York City, and my family was an inveterate reader of newspapers and I loved holding a paper in my hand.

They were 13 weeks premature. Gerry weighed 1 pound 14 ounces, and Zachary 1 pound 11 ounces. They were the first male twins to ever survive at Pennsylvania Hospital.","I'm really not interested in other people's opinions, because I think frankly most of those opinions are either misinformed and adding to this endless ball of hot air we have in our society where everyone thinks their opinion is valuable and sacred and what counts.","I think the only safe medium are books, because people like to hold books in their hand.","I think the older you are, the more you're going to cling to the printed word as being sacred.","Well I just always wanted to be a newspaper reporter.","I like to write with a lot of emotion and a lot of power. Sometimes I overdo it; sometimes my prose is a little bit too purple, and I know that.","Teams are made up of a lot of components. They're made up of hunger, they're made up of desire, they're made up of chemistry, and they're made up of emotion.","If someone is going to criticize what you've written and you believe in what you've written then you should respond.","I don't have many friends in Philadelphia. I sort of have one. I have the dog and someone else.","One of the exciting things about reporting is going to places you've never been to before.","I always had a curiosity about Texas. I had a curiosity about small-town life, although, granted, Odessa's not a tiny town.","Maybe it's a tired tale, but without an education, you're not going to go anywhere.","There are the medical dangers of football in general caused by head trauma over repetitive hits.","I actually like football a great deal.","But I would much prefer students going to college to learn and be prepared for the rigors of the new economic order, rather than dumping fees on them to subsidize football programs that, far from enhancing the academic mission instead make a mockery of it.","If you leave your wife and you don't ever contact her again, that says something about how you felt about the marriage.","Committing unnecessary surgeries is very, very rare.

Jon Benjamin":["If you do nothing long enough, something's bound to happen.","I'm not opposed to putting myself in danger for meaningless comedy.","Cute girls and burgers. What more can you ask for? That's why we live in America.","I've never worked for a show or was on a show where I didn't have a lot of control creatively, but then again, I haven't worked on a lot of shows.","I've learned to wait 'til an idea is worth making. That's not really a lesson I've learned; I sort of always did it that way.

But I'm getting older, and I just can't stop eating wonderful food. Rich, wonderful food.","It's physically hard for me to work. I start to break down, physically. My joints start. I get weepy eyes. I don't sleep well. I was never a hard worker, I guess. So the voiceover work ethic is really great for me - couple days a month, two hours a day.","I started doing comedy with no plan to do voice work. Voice work came as a function of doing comedy and meeting people who eventually develop shows like that.

Almost inevitably he comes to the conclusion that the government he lives under is dishonest, insane, intolerable.","The urge to save humanity is almost always a false front for the urge to rule.","Democracy is the art and science of running the circus from the monkey cage.","Every man sees in his relatives, and especially in his cousins, a series of grotesque caricatures of himself.","A man may be a fool and not know it, but not if he is married.","In this world of sin and sorrow there is always something to be thankful for; as for me, I rejoice that I am not a Republican.","It is hard to believe that a man is telling the truth when you know that you would lie if you were in his place.","It is inaccurate to say that I hate everything.

The haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy.","In war the heroes always outnumber the soldiers ten to one.","A cynic is a man who, when he smells flowers, looks around for a coffin.","Love is the triumph of imagination over intelligence.","Each party steals so many articles of faith from the other, and the candidates spend so much time making each other's speeches, that by the time election day is past there is nothing much to do save turn the sitting rascals out and let a new gang in.","The one permanent emotion of the inferior man is fear - fear of the unknown, the complex, the inexplicable. What he wants above everything else is safety.","Before a man speaks it is always safe to assume that he is a fool. After he speaks, it is seldom necessary to assume it.","I believe in only one thing: liberty; but I do not believe in liberty enough to want to force it upon anyone.","Every normal man must be tempted, at times, to spit on his hands, hoist the black flag, and begin slitting throats.","Every decent man is ashamed of the government he lives under.","I never smoked a cigarette until I was nine.","Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard.","An idealist is one who, on noticing that roses smell better than a cabbage, concludes that it will also make better soup.","It is not materialism that is the chief curse of the world, as pastors teach, but idealism.

Leave him alone, and he does not know what to do except bark and howl and trot about till sheer exhaustion forces him to sleep.","The most merciful thing in the world... is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.","From even the greatest of horrors, irony is seldom absent.","Children, old crones, peasants, and dogs ramble; cats and philosophers stick to their point.","One can never produce anything as terrible and impressive as one can awesomely hint about.","I am not very proud of being an human being; in fact, I distinctly dislike the species in many ways.

But, since all this knowledge of our limitations cannot possibly be of any value to us, it is better to ignore it in our daily conduct of life.","All of my tales are based on the fundamental premise that common human laws and emotions have no validity or significance in the cosmos-at-large.","The man or nation of high culture may acknowledge to great lengths the restraints imposed by conventions and honour, but beyond a certain point, primitive will or desire cannot be curbed.","We call ourselves a dog's 'master' - but who ever dared to call himself the 'master' of a cat? We own a dog - he is with us as a slave and inferior because we wish him to be. But we entertain a cat - he adorns our hearth as a guest, fellow-lodger, and equal because he wishes to be there.","Certain of Poe's tales possess an almost absolute perfection of artistic form which makes them veritable beacon-lights in the province of the short story.","The earliest English attempts at rhyming probably included words whose agreement is so slight that it deserves the name of mere 'assonance' rather than that of actual rhyme.","Truth is of no practical value to mankind save as it affects terrestrial phenomena, hence the discoveries of science should be concealed or glossed over wherever they conflict with orthodoxy.","Blue, green, grey, white, or black; smooth, ruffled, or mountainous; that ocean is not silent.","The cat is such a perfect symbol of beauty and superiority that it seems scarcely possible for any true aesthete and civilised cynic to do other than worship it.","The real lover of cats is one who demands a clearer adjustment to the universe than ordinary household platitudes provide; one who refuses to swallow the sentimental notion that all good people love dogs, children, and horses while all bad people dislike and are disliked by such.","Bunch together a group of people deliberately chosen for strong religious feelings, and you have a practical guarantee of dark morbidities expressed in crime, perversion, and insanity.","I do not think that any realism is beautiful.","I have no illusions concerning the precarious status of my tales and do not expect to become a serious competitor of my favorite weird authors.","No breed of cats in its proper condition can by any stretch of the imagination be thought of as even slightly ungraceful - a record against which must be pitted the depressing spectacle of impossibly flattened bulldogs, grotesquely elongated dachshunds, hideously shapeless and shaggy Airedales, and the like.","I never ask a man what his business is, for it never interests me. What I ask him about are his thoughts and dreams.","In theory I am an agnostic, but pending the appearance of rational evidence, I must be classed, practically and provisionally, as an atheist.","Life is a hideous thing, and from the background behind what we know of it peer daemoniacal hints of truth which make it sometimes a thousandfold more hideous.","I am disillusioned enough to know that no man's opinion on any subject is worth a damn unless backed up with enough genuine information to make him really know what he's talking about.","I am essentially a recluse who will have very little to do with people wherever he may be. I think that most people only make me nervous - that only by accident, and in extremely small quantities, would I ever be likely to come across people who wouldn't.","The reason why time plays a great part in so many of my tales is that this element looms up in my mind as the most profoundly dramatic and grimly terrible thing in the universe.","Fear is our deepest and strongest emotion, and the one which best lends itself to the creation of nature-defying illusions.","It is only the forcible propagation of conventional Christianity that makes the agnostic so bitter toward the church. He knows that all the doctrines cannot possibly be true, but he would view them with toleration if he were asked merely to let them alone for the benefit of the masses whom they can help and succour.","The end of a story must be stronger rather than weaker than the beginning, since it is the end which contains the denouement or culmination and which will leave the strongest impression upon the reader.","One superlatively important effect of wide reading is the enlargement of vocabulary which always accompanies it.","I fear my enthusiasm flags when real work is demanded of me.","For correct writing, the cultivation of patience and mental accuracy is essential. Throughout the young author's period of apprenticeship, he must keep reliable dictionaries and textbooks at his elbow; eschewing as far as possible that hasty extemporaneous manner of writing which is the privilege of more advanced students.","The 'punch' of a truly weird tale is simply some violation or transcending of fixed cosmic law - an imaginative escape from palling reality - hence, phenomena rather than persons are the logical 'heroes.'","Denied anything ardently desired, the individual or state will argue and parley just so long - then, if the impelling motive be sufficiently great, will cast aside every rule and break down every acquired inhibition, plunging viciously after the object wished; all the more fantastically savage because of previous repression.","The cat is classic whilst the dog is Gothic - nowhere in the animal world can we discover such really Hellenic perfection of form, with anatomy adapted to function, as in the felidae.","From my experience, I cannot doubt but that man, when lost to terrestrial consciousness, is indeed sojourning in another and uncorporeal life of far different nature from the life we know; and of which only the slightest and most indistinct memories linger after waking.","The appeal of the spectrally macabre is generally narrow because it demands from the reader a certain degree of imagination and a capacity for detachment from everyday life.","Write out the story - rapidly, fluently, and not too critically - following the second or narrative-order synopsis. Change incidents and plot whenever the developing process seems to suggest such change, never being bound by any previous design.","Science, already oppressive with its shocking revelations, will perhaps be the ultimate exterminator of our human species - if separate species we be - for its reserve of unguessed horrors could never be borne by mortal brains if loosed upon the world.","It is easy to remove the mind from harping on the lost illusion of immortality. The disciplined intellect fears nothing and craves no sugar-plum at the day's end, but is content to accept life and serve society as best it may.","There are, I think, four distinct types of weird story: one expressing a mood or feeling, another expressing a pictorial conception, a third expressing a general situation, condition, legend or intellectual conception, and a fourth explaining a definite tableau or specific dramatic situation or climax.","Very few minds are strictly normal, and all religious fanatics are marked with abnormalities of various sorts.","Indeed, there is much in pure humanitarian culture, as opposed to rigid scientific training, which encourages absorption in the affairs of mankind, and more or less indifference to the unfathomed abysses of star-strown space that yawn interminably about this terrestrial grain of dust.","Nothing is really typical of my efforts... I'm simply casting about for better ways to crystallise and capture certain strong impressions (involving the elements of time, the unknown, cause and effect, fear, scenic and architectural beauty, and other seemingly ill-assorted things) which persist in clamouring for expression.","We must realise that man's nature will remain the same so long as he remains man; that civilisation is but a slight coverlet beneath which the dominant beast sleeps lightly and ever ready to awake. To preserve civilisation, we must deal scientifically with the brute element, using only genuine biological principles.","To me, there is nothing but puerility in a tale in which the human form - and local human passions and conditions and standards - are depicted as native to other worlds and universes.","There be those who say that things and places have souls, and there be those who say they have not; I dare not say, myself, but I will tell of The Street.","I couldn't live a week without a private library - indeed, I'd part with all my furniture and squat and sleep on the floor before I'd let go of the 1500 or so books I possess.","If I could create an ideal world, it would be an England with the fire of the Elizabethans, the correct taste of the Georgians, and the refinement and pure ideals of the Victorians.","I am well-nigh resolv'd to write no more tales but merely to dream when I have a mind to, not stopping to do anything so vulgar as to set down the dream for a boarish Publick.","I have concluded that Literature is no proper pursuit for a gentleman and that Writing ought never to be consider'd but as an elegant Accomplishment to be indulg'd in with infrequency and Discrimination.","Horror and the unknown or the strange are always closely connected so that it is hard to create a convincing picture of shattered natural law or cosmic alienage or 'outsideness' without laying stress on the emotion of fear.","In writing a weird story, I always try very carefully to achieve the right mood and atmosphere and place the emphasis where it belongs.","Even when the characters are supposed to be accustomed to the wonder, I try to weave an air of awe and impressiveness corresponding to what the reader should feel. A casual style ruins any serious fantasy.","Atmosphere, not action, is the great desideratum of weird fiction. Indeed, all that a wonder story can ever be is a vivid picture of a certain type of human mood.","Horrors, I believe, should be original - the use of common myths and legends being a weakening influence.","Orthodox Christianity, by playing upon the emotions of man, is able to accomplish wonders toward keeping him in order and relieving his mind. It can frighten or cajole him away from evil more effectively than could reason.","We should perceive that man's period of historical existence, a period so short that his physical constitution has not been altered in the slightest degree, is insufficient to allow of any considerable mental change.","Man's respect for the imponderables varies according to his mental constitution and environment. Through certain modes of thought and training, it can be elevated tremendously, yet there is always a limit.","It would not be amiss for the novice to write the last paragraph of his story first, once a synopsis of the plot has been carefully prepared - as it always should be.","An excellent habit to cultivate is the analytical study of the King James Bible. For simple yet rich and forceful English, this masterly production is hard to equal; and even though its Saxon vocabulary and poetic rhythm be unsuited to general composition, it is an invaluable model for writers on quaint or imaginative themes.","That metre itself forms an essential part of all true poetry is a principle which not even the assertions of an Aristotle or the pronouncements of a Plato can disestablish."],"H. R. Giger":["You know I was curious - I was interested in all kinds of mystery or deeper meanings in the paintings because I myself have not analyzed why they have turned out like this or like that.","No, I didn't work it out upside down, I never turned it around.","Some people say my work is often depressing and pessimistic, with the emphasis on death, blood, overcrowding, strange beings and so on, but I don't really think it is.","I don't know, if somebody doesn't tell me how would I know?","There is hope and a kind of beauty in there somewhere, if you look for it.","Some people would say my paintings show a future world and maybe they do, but I paint from reality. I put several things and ideas together, and perhaps, when I have finished, it could show the future.","You get talent when you discover the ground of your pain.","I like elegance. I like art nouveau; a stretched line or curve. These things are very much in the foreground of my work.","You know, I said I have this problem that I need to more carefully read Akron's text because it's too much, too much fantasy, and so I am busy with other stuff - it's funny, it's nice to hear that someone is studying that carefully and now I know a little bit more about that.","You know, it was just another presentation of my work, and a funny one, because the cards are quite different from the normal Tarot deck, no?","I was my mother's favorite, and she'd help me with everything.","Sometimes people only see horrible, terrible things in my paintings.","I'm a painter, really. To be successful, you have to go to Hollywood, and I didn't like to travel.","When I was a young boy, I was obsessed with skulls and mummies and things like that."],"H. R. McMaster":["You have to keep listening and thinking and being critical and self-critical. Remember General Nivelle, in the First World War, at Verdun? He said he had the solution and then destroyed the French Army until it mutinied.","Be skeptical of concepts that divorce war from its political nature, particularly those that promise fast, cheap victory through technology.","Every time you treat an Iraqi disrespectfully, you are working for the enemy.","Lyndon Johnson was a profoundly insecure man who feared dissent and craved reassurance. In 1964 and 1965, Johnson's principal goals were to win the presidency in his own right and to pass his Great Society legislation through Congress.","Much of the conventional wisdom associated with Vietnam was highly inaccurate. Far from an inevitable result of the imperative to contain communism, the war was only made possible through lies and deceptions aimed at the American public, Congress, and members of Lyndon Johnson's own administration.","Because war is a competition involving life and death, and in which national security and vital interests are at stake, establishing an objective other than winning is not only counterproductive, but also irresponsible and wasteful. In some circumstances, it is also unethical.","The war in Vietnam was not lost in the field, nor was it lost on the front pages of the 'New York Times' or the college campuses. It was lost in Washington, D.C.","People fight today for the same fundamental reasons the Greek historian Thucydides identified nearly 2,500 years ago: fear, honor, and interest.","The professed war-weariness among populations who have sent only a small percentage of their sons and daughters to fight in recent wars may derive from a failure to communicate effectively what is at stake in those wars and explain why the efforts are worthy of the risks, resources, and sacrifices necessary to sustain the strategy.","We confuse activity with progress, and that's always dangerous, especially in war.","In the Army, because the stakes are so high - right? - you can't just be a yes-man and say, 'Great idea, boss!' if you don't believe it - right? - because lives are at stake. And the commanders that I've worked for, they want frank assessments; they want criticism and feedback.","Muslims who commit terrorist acts are perverting their religion.","When we came to Iraq, we didn't understand the complexity - what it meant for a society to live under a brutal dictatorship with ethnic and sectarian divisions. When we first got here, we made a lot of mistakes. We were like a blind man, trying to do the right thing but breaking a lot of things.","What is certain about the future is that even the best efforts to predict the conditions of future war will prove erroneous. What is important, however, is to not be so far off the mark that visions of the future run counter to the very nature of war and render American forces unable to adapt to unforeseen challenges.","It is clear that while our Army was engaged in Afghanistan and Iraq, Russia studied U.S. capabilities and vulnerabilities and embarked on an ambitious and largely successful modernization effort.","In the years leading up to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, thinking about defense was driven by ideas that regarded successful military operations as ends in themselves rather than just one instrument of power that must be coordinated with others to achieve - and sustain - political goals.","What we can afford least is to define the problem of future war as we would like it to be and, by doing so, introduce into our defense vulnerabilities based on self-delusion.","War is, in fact, an extension of politics, and in any war, military operations have to be conducted in such a way that they contribute to sustainable political outcomes consistent with vital interests that are at stake in that war.","Consequences of linear thinking in Afghanistan and Iraq included overestimating indigenous forces' capabilities, underestimating the enemy, and the associated expectation that the coalition could soon reduce force levels and shift to an exclusively advisory effort.","It is in their inherent moral components that recent Western strategies may be deficient. What percentage of the populations in countries engaged in the 14-year effort in Afghanistan could even name the three main Taliban groups with whom their soldiers have been engaged?","Offensive operations and hunting down the enemy is an integral part of any counterinsurgency approach.","It's astounding the degree to which these communities are intermarried. Iraq is a crazy quilt of ethnicities and religious sects.","The key thing about force protection is... if you focus too much on force protection, and you disengage yourself from the community, you're putting yourself at greater risk because you need to interact with the community in a positive way to gain the intelligence you need.","I think any of us who have been involved in the mission of Iraq have developed a great deal of affection for the Iraqi people and are emotionally invested in what we think is a vital mission... So I think any of my contemporaries would welcome the opportunity to go back and make a contribution to this extraordinarily important mission.","It is important to understand how leaders have adapted and thought about war and warfare across their careers. 'The Autobiography of General Ulysses S. Grant: Memoirs of the Civil War' is perhaps the best war memoir ever written.","It's important to study and understand your responsibilities within any profession, but it's particularly important for military officers to read, think, discuss, and write about the problem of war and warfare so they can understand not just the changes in the character of warfare but also the continuities.","We're so enamored of technological advancements that we fail to think about how to best apply those technologies to what we're trying to achieve. This can mask some very important continuities in the nature of war and their implications for our responsibilities as officers.","We often operate effectively on the physical battleground but not on the psychological battleground. We fail to communicate our resolve.","Some people have a misunderstanding about the Army. Some people think, 'Hey, you're in the military, and everything is super-hierarchical, and you're in an environment that is intolerable of criticism, and people don't want frank assessments.' I think the opposite is the case.","Bombing, particularly from the perspective of the receiving end, is not 'communication.' Bombs result in death and destruction.","After engaging in acts of war against another nation, there exists a degree of uncertainty in terms of the enemy's reactions. War inspires an unpredictable psychology and evokes strong emotions that defy systems analysis quantification.","My personal experience in Ninawa Province has been that, at the most fundamental level, people don't really care if it's a Shiite, a Sunni, a Kurd, or a Turkoman that's providing them security as long as that force treats them with respect.","What we have found is that we were the principal mediators in many cases between the Iraqis and their own security forces and their own government, and so you have to almost embrace that role.","The important thing to remember is war does not progress linearly. The future course of events is going to be very difficult to predict with a high degree of precision.","Although combat operations unseated the Taliban and the Saddam Hussein regime, a poor understanding of the recent histories of the Afghan and Iraqi peoples undermined efforts to consolidate early battlefield gains into lasting security.","There are two ways to fight the United States military: asymmetrically and stupid. Asymmetrically means you're going to try to avoid our strengths. In the 1991 Gulf War, it's like we called Saddam's army out into the schoolyard and beat up that army."],"H. Rap Brown":["I seek truth over a lie; I seek justice over injustice; I seek righteousness over the rewards of evildoers, and I love Allah more than I love the state.","Look at the newborn baby. It struggles to breathe after living in the womb. And yet, growth comes as a result of struggle. Even when we talk about jihad. We need to attach consciousness to struggle. This struggle has to be both individual and collective.","The only politics in this country that's relevant to black people today is the politics of revolution... none other.","See, it's no in between: you're either free or you're a slave.","My name is Imam Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, the former H. Rap Brown. I am a devoted servant of Allah, and an unwavering devotee to His cause. For more than 30 years, I have been tormented and persecuted by my enemies for reasons of race and belief.","To be successful in struggle requires remembrance of the Creator and the doing of good deeds. This is important because successful struggle demands that there be a kind of social consciousness. There has to be a social commitment, a social consciousness that joins men together.","Everybody in the black community must organize, and then we decide whether we will have alliance with other people or not, but not until we are organized.","They cannot divide us by saying that you're middle class or you're lower class.","See, justice is a joke in this country, and it stinks of its hypocricy.","Revolution comes when human beings set out to correct decadent institutions.","Class structures are a luxury that we cannot afford.","I say violence is necessary. It is as American as cherry pie.","You see, the poverty program for the last five years have been buy-off programs.","Yes, politics IS war without bloodshed; and war is an extension of those politics.","One of the lies that we tell ourselves is that we're making progress; but Huey's chair's empty.","But black people fall for that same argument, and they go around talking about law breakers. We did not make the laws in this country. We are neither morally nor legally confined to those laws. Those laws that keep them up, keep us down.","The first responsibility of the Muslim is as teacher. That is his job, to teach. His first school, his first classroom is within the household. His first student is himself. He masters himself and then he begins to convey the knowledge that he has acquired to the family. The people who are closest to him.","Attack those concepts such as 'third world.' Think about it. If we look at it in terms of numbers, then people of color are the majority in this world. We should be the 'first world.'","There is no such thing as a black middle class.","You've got to stop dividing yourselves. You got to organize.","We talking about revolution because that's the era that you're caught in.","We happen to be the vanguard of that revolutionary struggle because we are the most dispossessed.","There's no such thing as second class citizenship. That's like telling me you can be a little bit pregnant.","The poverty program was not designed to eliminate poverty.","The only thing that's going to free Huey is gun powder.","The man does not beat your head because you got a Cadillac or because you got a Ford; he beats you because you're black!","So black people all across this country are uniting. They must unite, and they must organize themselves.","No such thing as a Dixiecrat.","In terms of the revolution, I believe that the revolution will be a revolution of dispossessed people in this country: that's the Mexican American, the Puerto Rican American, the American Indian, and black people.","If America don't come around, we're gonna' burn it down.","Black people must address itself to the causes of poverty. That's oppression in this country.","And understand: class differences will not save you.","An old African leader says about leadership, he says that leadership should never be shared; it should always remain in the hands of the dispossessed people. We will lead the revolution.","To be successful in struggle requires remembrance of the Creator and the doing of good deeds. This is important because successful struggle demands that there be a kind of social consciousness.","There has to be a social commitment, a social consciousness that joins men together. On the basis of their coming together, they do not transgress against themselves and they do not transgress against others.","When you understand your obligations to God then you can understand your obligations to society."],"H. Robert Horvitz":["The number of cells in our bodies is defined by an equilibrium of opposing forces: mitosis adds cells, while programmed cell death removes them. Just as too much cell division can lead to a pathological increase in cell number, so can too little cell death.","My mother has been a wonderful model for the professional woman - a loving mother dedicated to both her family and her work. She inspired me, made me proud, and developed in me an enormous respect for women in general.","Because of the relationship between programmed cell death and human disease, the identification of the genes and proteins that function in the process of programmed cell death has provided new targets for possible intervention in a broad diversity of disorders.","Both of my parents were first-generation Americans, the children of Jews who left Eastern Europe around the turn of the century.","It was my father who - after, at age 15, I had attempted unsuccessfully to drive the family car using a 'borrowed' key and knocked down a wall of the garage - convinced me over the telephone not to run away from home and who then came home from work not to punish me but rather to console and comfort me.","My scientific pursuits have led to many opportunities and responsibilities beyond those of simply doing research. For example, as a beginning graduate student, it never occurred to me that the life of a scientist could involve so much travel, something that I have always loved.","Time and time again, truly basic studies of simple experimental organisms have proved directly relevant to human biology and human disease. An investment in such basic studies is an effective investment indeed."],"H. W. Brands":["Abraham Lincoln spoke out against the Mexican War. But once Americans were under fire, people who were on the fence felt obliged to support it.","If you put on the military uniform, you're a prima facie hero. Generals are the epitome of that. They're the ones who have been most successful at the soldier's trade.","There has always been interest in certain phases and aspects of history - military history is a perennial bestseller, the Civil War, that sort of thing. But I think that there is a lot of interest in historical biography and what's generally called narrative history: history as story-telling.","Harry Truman's decision to fire Douglas MacArthur at the height of the Korean War in April 1951 shocked the American political system and astonished the world. Much of the world didn't realize the president had the power to fire a five-star general; much of America didn't realize Truman had the nerve.","Previous candidates who get elected are almost always sobered by the office and the responsibility they take on. Donald Trump shows no evidence of that. He's the same Trump that he was when he was host of his reality TV show. He's the same Trump that he was when he was a candidate.","I've been writing American history for a long time, and I've had a hard time finding strong, interesting female characters. There are women, of course, in American history, but they're hard to write about because they don't leave much of a historical trace, and they're not usually involved in high-profile public events.","I certainly don't think that the heirs of the American Revolution were a particularly noble class.","When the Constitution was written in 1787, there was this supposition that American politics would be above party. The people who would staff the positions in government would have the interests of the country, or at least their states and congressional districts, at heart, and so they wouldn't form permanent political parties.","The president of the United States from the 1940s until 2017 was considered the leader of the free world - probably the most powerful person in the world - not simply in terms of America's military might but in terms of the moral authority of the president. Donald Trump has largely abdicated that.","Everything that happens today is like something in the past, but it's also unlike things in the past. We never know until an event happens if it's the similarities or differences that matter more.","Reagan conspired in the underestimation of his own ability.","In revering the Founders, we undervalue ourselves and sabotage our own efforts to make improvements - necessary improvements - in the republican experiment they began.","Our love for the Founders leads us to abandon, and even to betray, the very principles they fought for.","If the incumbent or his party has been discredited sufficiently, the challenger can run a successful, content-free campaign.","Every work of history is a combination of argument and narrative. The longer I write, the more I emphasize the narrative, the story, and the less attention I give to the argument. Arguments come and go.","Once you become president, you don't even have to stop for red lights. And if it looks like traffic's too bad, you just take a helicopter.","I'm often asked, 'Why didn't Benjamin Franklin ever become president?' My short, easy answer is: He died.","Every year, I have my graduate students read the great works of history, from classical times to the present. They gamely tackle Tacitus, ponder Plutarch, plow through Gibbon. Then they get to Thomas Carlyle and feel like Dorothy when she touched down in Technicolor Oz.","I never admit to wishing I'd written something by another author, but if my name mysteriously appeared on the title page of 'The Guns of August,' I wouldn't complain.","I read in all forms: paper, computer, phone, audio.","The more of my readers I encounter who say, often apologetically, that they are actually listeners, the more I write for the ear rather than the eye. Small things like identifying speakers in dialogue rather than relying on paragraphing to mark the shifts.","I'm the farthest thing from a bibliophile. I purge my collection regularly: If I haven't read a book in a couple of years, I try to give it to someone who will.","Even when candidates have degrees from Harvard and Yale, they try to run as the candidate of the common man.","You can always find people, ordinary people, who will support your particular view, so it becomes a politics of personality, especially at the presidential level. People often go for somebody that they like or somebody that they can identify with.","The Reagan Revolution has had no second act.","Reagan's enduring value as a conservative icon stems from his resolute preaching of the conservative gospel, in words that still warm the hearts of the most zealous conservatives. Yet Reagan's value as a conservative model must begin with recognition of his flexibility in the pursuit of his conservative goals.","He used humor more effectively than any president since Abraham Lincoln. Reagan was not an especially warm person, but he appeared to be. Many people disliked his policies, but almost no one disliked him.","Reagan refused to demonize his foes. Instead he charmed them, with a few exceptions, including Tip O'Neill, the Democratic Speaker of the House and the embodiment of the liberalism Reagan sought to reverse.","It wasn't the smiling Trump that people elected. It was the frowning, glowering, angry Donald Trump that people elected.","To me, the puzzle of Ronald Reagan is how a comparatively ordinary man, someone with not extraordinary talent, accomplished such extraordinary results. At the age of 50, no one expected that this was going to be the guy who would become, at least in my interpretation, one of the two most important presidents of the 20th century.","Toward the end of the 1964 presidential campaign, Reagan gives a speech on behalf of Barry Goldwater. It was like a screen test for a new career.","Most presidents have not considered 100 days a significant milepost.","Interest in the Founders has risen and fallen over time, as has admiration for them and their accomplishments.","The Founders were anything but demigods to themselves and their contemporaries, who recognized full well that the experiment in self-government had only begun.","Love makes the most careful man wreckless.","People who teach American history survey classes have a lot of ground to cover and tend to focus on landmarks. You get through the Civil War and Reconstruction, and you have to get to the beginning of the 20th century fast. It's pretty easy to go lightly on the Gilded Age.","The president was not the most important political player in the 19th century. Besides Jefferson at the beginning, Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln, the center of politics was Congress.","The historic dearth of labor was perhaps the central feature of the American economy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.","The Catalonian movement is quite serious; I don't think it's simply symbolic. I think that they believe that Catalonia can be more successful on its own than as part of Spain.","It's not an exaggeration to say that Texas gets a lot more out of being part of the United States than the United States gets out of having Texas as one of the states.","A president can start a war under relatively specious circumstances, and once American soldiers are under fire, Americans will support the soldiers and support the president.","A lot of people were ambivalent about Vietnam. Lyndon Johnson in 1964 positioned himself as the peace candidate. Once Johnson sent large amounts of troops into battle in 1965, most Americans were behind the war.","If - heaven forbid - a shooter did come into my class, I wouldn't want to have to worry about getting caught in a crossfire.","In the early 19th to the early 20th century, people had a lot of things wrong with them. Doctors didn't know how to fix them, and so they lived with them.","The candidate who promises the most has the best chance of winning.","The American political system is based on the president taking the initiative and Congress responding. With President Trump, it's been the opposite.","When a president doesn't know the policy, it doesn't make for a very effective leader.","It's hard to say that Trump actually has a health care policy.","Theodore Roosevelt, when he was out of office, he would do things to draw attention. But when you are president, you don't need to shout. When you are in office, you are the story.","When people think of the oil industry, they think of Rockefeller, much like when people think of the software industry, they think of Bill Gates.","In the business arena, the standard rules of morality don't apply. What we're really looking for is efficiency. It doesn't do anyone any good to be nice to the weak. In a certain sense, competition is inefficient.","On style points alone, Donald Trump makes GWB look magnificently presidential.","Although this should not be so, historians reconsider presidencies based on how the presidents conduct themselves after leaving office.","George W. Bush has shown himself to be a decent guy, not exploiting his former office to make top dollars giving speeches.","President Obama ran a campaign in 2008 that was entirely expected from a non-incumbent. You promise, and you imply that if you elect me, everything good is going to happen.","Americans knock themselves out, especially since 9/11, praising the military.","If you wanted to, you could write history in Haiku.","The shelf life of a seventh-year State of the Union address is about five minutes. Presidents can propose stuff. They're probably not likely to get it done.","You might say presidents are drafting the first chapter of their memoirs in these seventh-year State of the Union addresses. They're trying to get the public and the media to think about their presidencies in the way that they would like to have them thought of.","I cannot think of a president or administration that has taken seriously the 100 days.","In modern times, the American military has become more bureaucratised.","President Trump is doing what he can to act decisively. And if there's one thing most people have in mind in distinguishing the business world from the political world is that the CEO of a business can act decisively.","In some ways, I would be absolutely fascinated if Trump gets elected.","There is a certain kind of sobering, civilizing effect that being president imposes on people. There is a certain kind of dignity with which you comport yourself. As an observer of the presidency, I have to wonder if Trump would follow that pattern.","I'm more inclined to say the presidency has changed Trump rather than Trump changed the presidency. He has moderated or reversed himself on most of the positions he took as a candidate. Reality has set in, as it does with every new president.","By the early 1960s, there was a moral consensus on what needed to be done on civil rights.","The president is the one person who potentially could be the unifying figure in the country. And if the president or a presidential candidate basically writes off 40 states, then how in the world do the people in those 40 states feel like they have a stake in that person or that election?","In the academic world, biographies of these great figures of the past fell out of favor in the 1960s, when there was a turn toward social history, which meant the history of the voiceless and faceless. But the public at large never embraced the idea that these dead white guys should be abandoned.","When you're actually president, the spin matters a lot less.","For Andrew Jackson, politics was very personal. He hated not just the federal debt. He hated debt at all.","In the early days of the republic, the secretary of state was the heir apparent to the president. Presidents could easily hand-pick their party's next candidate. The party caucuses formally selected the candidates, but presidents guided the process.","Booker Washington was essentially the head Republican boss in the South. He was a power broker.","Booker Washington was branded an accommodationist by many of the people who criticized him.","Presidents are evaluated not by what they did by the stroke of their own pen; it's what they persuade Congress to do.","America can change its presidents, but the world doesn't change.","Members of Congress are somewhat reluctant to tangle with a president who seems to have the backing of the American people.","Presidents have to decide what their popularity is for. Lyndon Johnson probably understood best that political popularity is a wasting asset. You had to use it when you had it.","I had this grand plan for writing the history of the United States in six volumes. This was in the mid-1990s; I was fairly young and very ambitious. I pitched it to a publisher, who just laughed at me.","People are interested in people. They buy biographies; they don't buy studies of presidencies.","When you look at the development of the American presidency, you see that the presidents who have had the greatest impact are the ones who fit their times most successfully.","Politics is not something most people have to do every day. Their daily lives are much more influenced by job opportunities, whether the country is in a recession or a boom period. If you really want to understand what drives American history, look at the economic... side.","The race question in America has often been about race, but it has equally often been about power.","With my students, I always have to sell my subject because I know when you're 19, 20 years old, you've got other things on your mind besides American history. What I have to do is make this as compelling as possible.","I've probably written some books - I know I've written some books that were more interesting to me than to a large audience, but that was mostly when I was first getting started in academia and writing for a narrow audience.","The stories that I tell, the topics that I choose to write about, usually are suggested by something that I've done before.","I was raised in, and presumably to, the cutlery business. I really didn't think that that's what I wanted to do for a career. But I felt a certain obligation to give it a try.","It's hard to get in the head of somebody. The closest we can get is through the words they've left behind, either their contemporary correspondence or after-the-fact memoirs.","With my first few books, I was aiming at an academic audience, basically, to get tenure. You can presuppose a certain amount of knowledge; you can expect that there is this common background.","When you tell a story, there are imperatives of structure, of style, of pacing and all of this, that are there simply because you want to make it a good story. When do you introduce your characters? When do you put them onstage, when do you take them off the stage? How do you weave the different threads of the narrative together?","I'm trying to tell the story of the evolution of America. Each biography is a life in time, and I can see there's a particular task for each generation that I write about.","The Tea Party loves Reagan because he said exactly what they want to hear.","I had long known the story of Aaron Burr, but when I heard about his remarkable daughter, Theodosia, about the relationship between the two and about her tragic disappearance, I knew I wanted to tell their story.","Reagan is the subject of ongoing political debate, and a lot of liberals don't want to take Reagan any more seriously than they did when he was president. I understand why they don't, but they should.","Reagan has been deified by the Republican Party, which is odd. The Reagan that modern Republicans revere is not the real Reagan.","The Republican Party has moved substantially to the right of where Reagan was.","Reagan gave essentially the same speech from the beginning to the end of his political career, which was always, 'The American people are great, the government always screws things up, let's get the government out of the way.' On the foreign policy side it was, 'Communism is bad, and we're going to defeat it.'","Some years ago, I read Thomas Carlyle's history of the French Revolution, and I was very taken by the way he told the story, and it seemed as though I was right in the middle of things. And it took me a while to figure out how he achieved that effect, and one of the ways was to write it in the present tense.","I've been writing big stories of history, but there are a lot of fascinating little stories.","If it's a good story, it's a good story, and it draws readers in.","When a president was elected with foreign policy experience, it was usually less about his foreign policy experience than other things."],"Ha-Joon Chang":["The feeling of insecurity is inimical to our sense of wellbeing, as it causes anxiety and stress, which harms our physical and mental health. It is no surprise then that, according to some surveys, workers across the world value job security more highly than wages.","Sometimes people with strong ideology, whether left-wing or right-wing, refuse to do something simply because they believe it is wrong, when doing it actually benefits them. For some people, it's not just about money and political power.","To put it bluntly, there isn't one economic theory that can single-handedly explain Singapore's success; its economy combines extreme features of capitalism and socialism. All theories are partial; reality is complex.","The invention of the printing press was one of the most important events in human history.","Imagine if all those kings and dukes hadn't commissioned those crazy cathedrals, paintings and music... we'd still be living in sticks and mud. Because none of those things made any economic sense. Human beings' capacity to 'waste time' is a miracle - but that's exactly what art is for.","In the 19th century, a lot of people were against outlawing child labour, because to do so would be against the very foundations of a free market economy: 'These children want to work, these people want to employ them... what is your problem? It's not as if anyone has kidnapped them...'","When we assess the impact of technological changes, we tend to downplay things that happened a while ago.","Patent monopoly creates a lot of problems. It allows the patentee to charge the maximum to consumers. This may not be a problem if the patented product is a luxury item, like parts that go into a smartphone, but can violate basic human rights if it involves things such as life-saving drugs.","People tend to think that numbers are quite objective, but numbers in economics are not like this. Some economists say they're like sausages: you don't know what they really are until you cut into them.","By liberating women from household work and helping to abolish professions such as domestic service, the washing machine and other household goods completely revolutionised the structure of society.","Unfortunately, a lot of economists wanted to make their subject a science. So the more what you do resembles physics or chemistry, the more credible you become.","Overcoming the myth that there is such a thing as an objectively defined 'free market' is the first step towards understanding capitalism.","Contrary to what professional economists will typically tell you, economics is not a science. All economic theories have underlying political and ethical assumptions, which make it impossible to prove them right or wrong in the way we can with theories in physics or chemistry.","When I was growing up in South Korea in the '70s and early '80s, the country was too poor to buy original records. Everything was bootlegged.","As a consumer, I don't create art, but I think whatever the message is, art has to touch you.","As someone from a developing country, I have a problem with rich countries thinking they can tell us anything, simply because they are giving money.","Why do tax havens exist? Because rich countries allow them to. If the U.S. came down on tax havens in the same way they come down on countries that trade with Iran and Cuba, we'd have no tax havens in the world.","I'm not an anti-capitalist, or anarchist. I want capitalism to work.","Democracy, despite its limitations, is in the end the only way to ensure that policies do not simply benefit the privileged few.","Free market economists frequently see minimum wage legislation as mere political intervention. However, there are decent economic theories which show that, under certain circumstances, minimum wages can be beneficial, as it makes workers more productive.","A lot of things that we cannot buy and sell in markets used to be totally legal objects of market exchange - human beings when we had slavery, child labour, human organs, and so on. So there is no economic theory that actually says that you shouldn't have slavery or child labour because all these are political, ethical judgments.","Economics should be defined in terms of what it is about. It should be about how people produce things, how people exchange them, how people earn income, how they pay taxes, how the government provides infrastructure with tax revenue, and how it conducts monetary policy. The subject has to be defined in terms of the object of inquiry.","I am one of the most successful economists, according to what markets tell us, though most of my professional colleagues, who are much keener to accept market outcomes than I am, would dismiss me as a crank or - the worst of all abuses among economists - a 'sociologist.'","I don't drink at lunchtime because I'm very weak at alcohol like most Asians.","I used to joke that I came to England - not to the U.S. where most Koreans go - because I like Arthur Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie.","I've read quite a few readers' reviews of my book on Amazon, saying, 'Ah, he criticises the free market, he advocates central planning.' I don't do that for a minute! But this is our black and white, dichotomous way of thinking - which has really been harmful.","I like all kinds of music - classical, pop, rock, electronic.","I think this notion that public enterprises do not work and therefore nationalization will be a disaster, I mean, it's not supported by evidence.","Basically, the myth is that America has been founded on the free market; the government has done very little; it has thrived under free trade. But actually, if you look at the history, this is actually the country that has succeeded most with protectionist policies.","Very often, the judgments by ordinary citizens may be better than those by professional economists, being more rooted in reality and less narrowly focused.","Indeed, willingness to challenge professional economists and other experts is a foundation stone of democracy. If all we have to do is to listen to the experts, what is the point of having democracy?","We need to accept that consumption is not the end goal of our life and stop measuring our well-being simply on the basis of earnings. We need to explicitly take the quality of our work-related life into account in judging our well-being.","Markets are, in the end, man-made devices for utilitarian purposes, not a force of nature that we should not try to resist. If they end up serving the interests of only a tiny minority, as is increasingly the case, we have the right - and indeed the duty - to regulate them in the interest of greater social good.","What free-market economists are not telling us is that the politics they want to get rid of are none other than those of democracy itself. When they say we need to insulate economic policies from politics, they are in effect advocating the castration of democracy.","It is time that we dispensed with the myth that the market is a force of nature that should not be meddled with. Markets are social creations that can be, and have been, modified for social purposes.","Without there being some national strategy, it is difficult for educators to know what kinds of engineers or technicians to produce and for potential students to know what professions to study for.","Gone are the days when the upper classes were terrified of the angry mob wanting to smash their skulls and confiscate their properties. Now their biggest enemy is the army of lazy bums, whose lifestyle of indolence and hedonism, financed by crippling taxes on the rich, is sucking the lifeblood out of the economy.","Many financial and industrial companies have been bailed out with the public's money, but very few of those who had run those companies have been punished for their failures. Yes, the top managers of those companies have lost their jobs - but with a fat pension and mostly with a handsome severance payment.","It is one thing to tell the citizens of some faraway country to go to hell, but it is another to do the same to your own citizens, who are supposedly your ultimate sovereigns.","Every market has some rules and boundaries that restrict freedom of choice. A market looks free only because we so unconditionally accept its underlying restrictions that we fail to see them.","It is impossible to objectively define how free a market is. This is a political definition. Government is always involved, and those free marketers are as politically motivated as anyone.","Few countries have become rich through free-trade, free-market policies, and few ever will.","Many people think that the U.S. is ahead in the frontier technology sectors as a result of private sector entrepreneurship. It's not. The U.S. federal government created all these sectors.","The economy is much bigger than the market. We will not be able to build a good economy - nor a good society - unless we look at the vast expanse beyond the market.","Instead of reading a paper, we now read the news online. Instead of buying books at a store, we buy them on-line. What's so revolutionary? The Internet has mainly affected our leisure life.","Charities are now working to give people in poor countries access to the Internet. But shouldn't we spend that money on providing health clinics and safe water? Aren't these things more relevant? I have no intention of downplaying the importance of the Internet, but its impact has been exaggerated.","People always think they're in the middle of a revolution while they tend not to realize the enormity of a change that has happened in the past. The telegraph was a revolution, but who looks at it that way these days? The telegraph sped up the transportation of messages over long distances by a huge factor.","If we are really serious about preventing another crisis like the 2008 meltdown, we should simply ban complex financial instruments unless they can be unambiguously shown to benefit society in the long run.","The truth is that the free movement of goods, people, and money that developed under British hegemony between 1870 and 1913 - the first episode of globalization - was made possible, in large part, by military might rather than market forces."],"Hack Wilson":["In life, you need many more things besides talent. Things like good advice and common sense.","There are many kids in and out of baseball who think that just because they have some natural talent, they have the world by the tail.","When I see three balls, I just swing at the middle one.","In 1930, I was at the top of my career. I won the Most Valuable Player award.","Kids, don't be too big to accept advice."],"Hafez":["Send a bouquet of your face with the morning breeze.","Even after all this time, the sun never says to the earth, 'You owe me.' Look what happens with a love like that. It lights the whole sky.","Ever since happiness heard your name, it has been running through the streets trying to find you.","Oh Cup-bearer, set my glass afire with the light of wine!","I have learned so much from God that I can no longer call myself a Christian, a Hindu, a Muslim, a Buddhist, a Jew.","Don't be surprised at Fortune's turns and twists: That wheel has spun a thousand yarns before."],"Haile Gebrselassie":["Once you have commitment, you need the discipline and hard work to get you there.","When you run the marathon, you run against the distance, not against the other runners and not against the time.","First, do enough training. Then believe in yourself and say: I can do it. Tomorrow is my day. And then say: the person in front of me, he is just a human being as well; he has two legs, I have two legs, that is all. That is mentally how you prepare.","You need three things to win: discipline, hard work and, before everything maybe, commitment. No one will make it without those three. Sport teaches you that.","If your body is damaged, wounded, it can be fixed, but if inside, mentally, you are wounded you cannot fix it, it's hard.","Life is a kind of struggle. Life is a sort of fight.","At the moment I am a little bit politician, yes. I think that could be my next step. It is not because I want power, it is because of what I think I could do for the people.","When we race in London a world record will be the last thing on our minds.","If you're planning only to make money and nothing else, you'll be broke.","I used to run to school, 10k every day. And this at altitude, perfect preparation, really.","I can't change everything by myself but I can be one of the people who are trying to change the situation.","My father didn't think running was sensible. He told me running is just wasting time.","When I run in Ethiopia, I look out and see eucalyptus trees and rivers.","Since I achieved something, running has exploded in my country. For me sometimes it is difficult even to know who the athletes are who are competing at the highest level. There are thousands.","Always, if you win mentally, you can win physically as well.","You know the marathon in my country is just exceptional. It's like soccer in England. If England win the world cup and Ethiopia win the marathon - it's the same.","I want to avoid injuries by running only road.","The marathon always starts after 30K. That's where the problems start. You start without any problems, without any pain. All the pain comes after 30K. Sometimes, it's possible to have pain even in the finger.","What can you do if a part of it is uphill? You can't work out another route. You've just got to run the one they give you. But they tell me London is a nice course. Even the cobbles, I hope, are not very much of a problem for me.","In the rainy season, sometimes to get to the first lesson we had to run really quick, because we had to cross the river to school and we'd have to go up and down the bank to find a place to cross because there is no bridge.","I will always listen to my coaches. But first I listen to my body. If what they tell me suits my body, great. If my body doesn't feel good with what they say, then always my body comes first.","Eradicate poverty. This is all that matters in my country. When I am out training I think about this a lot; when I am running it is going over in my mind. As a country we cannot move forward until we eradicate poverty.","For me a day without training is like a day without eating.","This is what I wanted. They tell me that London is the best field in history. I wanted to be part of that. Because everyone will be there it will be a wonderful challenge for me. You can see the best runners, how they look, how they run. For me to beat the best is what counts.","I think if you come first with a new world record, that is the best.","He was not a runner, my father, but he was quick. I always remember it was very difficult to escape from him when he was angry. If he wanted to beat us he would always catch us. Even me, he could always catch me.","This hand is not very active always, because it was in this hand that I carried my books. My carrying hand was always my strongest. Now I think my other hand has developed more muscles from signing all those autographs.","My father thought sport was something fun - he didn't know it was a way to make money. Then I won a Mercedes at the world championships and I gave it to him. From the moment it arrived my father said: 'Good, you can support not just yourself but me too'.","I'm lucky. The best possible place in the world for training is Addis Ababa, so I am home all the time except when I am racing. I like to be there, near my family, my kids, also the real estate business I run with my wife.","You know, I want to help my country. Definitely I can help them, simply by winning races. Sure, they can follow my path to a good career. But for me it is not enough. I want to be more than that. In everything I want to be a role model.","That is not enough. Sport has been great for me, a great learning place that if you want to achieve you can, even if you are from the poorest part of Africa.","I haven't done a marathon for a long time. So we'll see. I will need good luck.","I have to change a lot of things before I become a good marathon runner.","I wanted to experience New York, to look up and see buildings.","You lose the speed before the stamina.","I love running and I will always run.","It is not my duty to spend my money in my country, but it is what I want to do. There is nowhere else I would like to invest.","I have seen things few of my countrymen have. The first time I went on an aeroplane I couldn't work out how the lavatories worked up in the sky.","When you promise something, you must fulfill it.","Athletes have to be confident and I am thinking like that.","In the marathon a crazy athlete can just keep pushing from the beginning, at a championship you don't need a time just to win the race.","The more you are getting older, you lose a little something. Of course there is another advantage, because of your long experience you can use it.","What is important is to win.","Why should I say I will retire in three or four years? You retire the very moment you utter those words.","My school was six miles away from where I lived on the farm. I had to walk and run, there and back every day, through gorges and over rivers. If I was late, there was a very big stick waiting for me.","Schooling is so important.","I find the business world hard.","I feel a social responsibility. We need to open people's eyes. There is a lack of education in Ethiopia.","Like some high official, you have to tell your brain: 'Do it. Come on. I have to do it.'","Some people start a sport just to reduce weight, or some say, 'My doctor ordered me to run and do exercise', and for others, they run for completely different benefits. But it is not like that with sport. We need to eat, we need to rest, but also we need to run.","I always tell young athletes the same thing, 'Wherever you go, whatever you do, what must your top priority be? Running.'","In my life I do a lot of things but I never forget my training.","Athletics is in my blood.","I'm a runner first before anything else.","I remember in particular my first victory when I achieved a very fast time in what were perfect conditions but since then the wind has always been a factor against me.","You know for me when I promise something I want to deliver. If you don't, you have to disappear.","I want to go down in history.","You must do as your people do. If my people are poor, I must be poor. People ask me, 'Why don't you find a personal coach or a private car?' I can't. Then I won't be part of my people.","I wanted to be famous. I wanted people to talk about me.","Many people know that Ethiopia is poor. When I break a world record, maybe people get to know something else about Ethiopia, something good. We can't make planes or cars, we don't have the materials. We do what we can.","I'm never satisfied.","I was the kind of child who worked hard every day with the cows and sheep - I was a very aggressive boy.","When I had no shoes I was comfortable - I used to run barefoot. When I wore shoes it was difficult. To run in shoes was ok, but at the beginning of my career it was hard.","If I don't train enough, of course I'm nervous.","At the end of the day, people want to see how fast you run.","If you are a really good marathoner, you have to run New York.","When I wake up at 5 in the morning is it just to jog? Definitely not, I give it all of my efforts.","Age for me is just a number."],"Haile Selassie":["Throughout history, it has been the inaction of those who could have acted; the indifference of those who should have known better; the silence of the voice of justice when it mattered most; that has made it possible for evil to triumph.","History teaches us that unity is strength, and cautions us to submerge and overcome our differences in the quest for common goals, to strive, with all our combined strength, for the path to true African brotherhood and unity.","We must become bigger than we have been: more courageous, greater in spirit, larger in outlook. We must become members of a new race, overcoming petty prejudice, owing our ultimate allegiance not to nations but to our fellow men within the human community.","An awareness of our past is essential to the establishment of our personality and our identity as Africans.","Peace is a day-to-day problem, the product of a multitude of events and judgments. Peace is not an 'is,' it is a 'becoming.'","The Charter of the United Nations expresses the noblest aspirations of man: abjuration of force in the settlement of disputes between states; the assurance of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion; the safeguarding of international peace and security.","This world was not created piecemeal. Africa was born no later and no earlier than any other geographical area on this globe. Africans, no more and no less than other men, possess all human attributes, talents and deficiencies, virtues and faults.","Do not worship me, I am not God. I'm only a man. I worship Jesus Christ.","Outside the kingdom of the Lord there is no nation which is greater than any other. God and history will remember your judgment.","We have before us the examples of the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. We must remember how long these required to achieve their union. When a solid foundation is laid, if the mason is able and his materials good, a strong house can be built.","Peace demands the united efforts of us all. Who can foresee what spark might ignite the fuse?","I have lived too long to cherish many illusions about the essential high-mindedness of men when brought into stark confrontation with the issue of control over their security, and their property interests.","Above all, we must avoid the pitfalls of tribalism. If we are divided among ourselves on tribal lines, we open our doors to foreign intervention and its potentially harmful consequences.","It is much easier to show compassion to animals. They are never wicked.","We all wish to live. We all seek a world in which men are freed of the burdens of ignorance, poverty, hunger and disease. And we shall all be hard-pressed to escape the deadly rain of nuclear fall-out should catastrophe overtake us.","The preservation of peace and the guaranteeing of man's basic freedoms and rights require courage and eternal vigilance: courage to speak and act - and if necessary, to suffer and die - for truth and justice; eternal vigilance, that the least transgression of international morality shall not go undetected and unremedied.","Africa shares with Asia a common background of colonialism, of exploitation, of discrimination, of oppression. At Bandung, African and Asian States dedicated themselves to the liberation of their two continents from foreign domination and affirmed the right of all nations to develop in their own way, free of any external interference.","Thousands of years ago, civilizations flourished in Africa which suffer not at all by comparison with those of other continents. In those centuries, Africans were politically free and economically independent. Their social patterns were their own and their cultures truly indigenous.","If a strong government finds that it can, with impunity, destroy a weak people, then the hour has struck for that weak people to appeal to the League of Nations to give its judgment in all freedom. God and history will remember your judgment.","Africa's mineral wealth is great; we should co-operate in its development.","The commentators of 1963 speak, in discussing Africa, of the Monrovia States, the Brazzaville Group, the Casablanca Powers, of these and many more. Let us put an end to these terms. What we require is a single African organisation through which Africa's single voice may be heard, within which Africa's problems may be studied and resolved.","We have finished the job, what shall we do with the tools?","The nations of Africa, as is true of every continent of the world, from time to time dispute among themselves. These quarrels must be confined to this continent and quarantined from the contamination of non-African interference.","The Ethiopian government's use of the railway from Djibouti to Addis Ababa was, in practice, a hazardous regards transport of arms intended for the Ethiopian forces.","Provision must be made for the extension of speedy and effective assistance when any African State is threatened with military aggression. We cannot rely solely on international morality."],"Hailee Steinfeld":["It needs to be said and heard: it's OK to be who you are.","My mom taught me to live by the three p's: to always be passionate, persistent, and prepared.","Fashion is something I've always been interested in... I used to watch the Oscars but paid no attention to the awards... It wasn't until I started attending red carpet events and was flown out to Paris for my first show, and saw how much is put into it all, that I had this new appreciation for everything.","I really love all types of music. I'm really open to that. I really love Bruno Mars, Justin Timberlake and some James Taylor and Elton John stuff.","I find that with period pieces, you're sort of able to really take advantage of what's around you because prop-wise, wardrobe-wise and location-wise, it's all so specific due to that time.","I love to hang out with my friends and go to the movies. My mom and I are involved in the Mother/Daughter Organization - national charity work. Whenever I get free time, we volunteer. It's an organization so mothers and daughters can spend time together while volunteering.","Every girl wishes she was Juliet in some version of their life.","The one thing I loved so much about making 'Pitch Perfect 2' - especially in comparison to a movie like 'Ten Thousand Saints' - is you can go and be yourself, and you just know that all your weirdness and craziness and imperfections are completely embraced and accepted.","I haven't even graduated from high school yet - and I've realised in the last four years, with all the travelling I've done and all of the movies I've made, that the world is my classroom. I've experienced things I don't know you can necessarily get from reading a history book.","With 'True Grit,' the language was very specific, as is Shakespeare. You couldn't really improvise, nor would you really ever have to. I never felt the need to. It was all so beautifully written, and it was all right there.","The idea of revenge coming from a 14-year-old girl isn't, you know, exactly right.","My very first audition was on the lot of Paramount, and I was put on tape and it was very nerve-racking. I think it was about 15 pages.","When 'Romeo and Juliet' came along, I fell in love with the way that it was written and how innocent and vulnerable it was and how different it was from 'True Grit.' I really liked that.","Whether I'm a bit of an old soul or not, I am who I am, and that doesn't change, whether I'm with adults or with my friends.","I don't know if it has set in or not. Honestly, it's crazy. It's such an amazing honor. I remember thinking back to being in my room waiting for the call to see if I got the part. It's like winning the lottery. I'm proud to be a member of such an amazing cast - that's the best award of all.","The rivalry between the Montague and the Capulet kids seems very modern to me. Juliet is a free spirit, full of untapped love and passion. I think a lot of girls can relate to her. And it's very relevant in terms of kids defying their parents.","I love the film route and I'm gong to try my hardest to stay on it.","There's a different energy with a female director, a female at the head of the production. I don't prefer one over the other, but they're definitely different experiences, and I would love to have more of them.","Everything I do now is a first.","I was just another girl.","Child actors come off as work being their life and doing it 24/7, but I still have those days where it's totally, like, whatever: shopping, movies, adventures.","Facebook is my life.","Well I was eight years old, and I have an older cousin who is three years older than me and she was doing acting, commercials, and modeling at the time and... to see my cousin doing that was really inspiring and I wanted to do it. So I went to my mom and I asked her if I could do it, and for the acting part of it, she made me study for a year.","My first modeling job was Gap, and my first time in front of the camera was for a Soda Pop Girls commercial - it's one of those Bratz dolls, Barbie dolls... one of those.","The shooting of the guns, that was kind of funny, because rolling a cigarette and shooting a gun aren't like normal things for a 13-year old girl!","When I was 13, I looked like I could play 16, and I wasn't mature enough to play 16.","Music is a very big part of my preparation as an actor.","I went to my mum at about seven or eight and said I want to start acting, but the week before, I had said I wanted to do ballet. She said if I took acting classes for a full year, she would look further into it, and that's how it started.","I was home-schooled.","It's hard not to love everything Prada does.","Singing is something I've always loved to do, and I'd never considered taking it further than the shower.","My character in 'True Grit' would set these goals for herself that seemed near impossible, but to her they were possible. She was never going to believe anything else other than that.","I feel that for the story of 'Romeo and Juliet' to be impactful, it has to be believable, and there has to be a certain level of chemistry between the two characters.","'When Marnie Was There' was the first animated film I've ever done.","When I was auditioning for 'True Grit,' I was on the Paramount lot. I was wearing clothes from the 1800s that were big and uncomfortable.","I feel like if you see five films not knowing who made them, you know which one is the Coen Brothers.","I feel like every day I discover new actors and new filmmakers and different genres, and it's just so cool.","Actors play different characters in every project they do. Though it has nothing to do with my craft, the red carpet gives me the opportunity to show who I really am and be myself."],"Hailemariam Desalegn":["Free media is very essential for the democratic process and... development.","We are ready to be criticised by any journalists because we know we are not perfect.","We need ethical journalism. There is also capacity limitations in journalism.","We have Israel always in our hearts.","We are different from many African countries. We represent Africa as the gateway and will do everything to make African and Israeli relations mushroom.","Border security is not only related to resources competition.","The water bodies are reducing everywhere in the Rift Valley. It's not because the water has been used. It's because the rivers flowing to the lakes are reducing because of climate change.","As one of the leading troop-contributing countries, Ethiopia attaches great importance to strengthening the role of United Nations peacekeeping to address challenges to international peace and security.","It should be underscored that our goal is not, and should not, be a crusade against the ICC but a solemn call for the organisation to take Africa's concerns seriously.","Ethiopia is an island of stability within the Horn of Africa, which is a troubled region.","Security starts from home. You have to secure your own people so that those who are coming from outside also will be secured.","There is tolerance within our community, Muslims and Christians living together in harmony. These traditional values we have should be enhanced.","We put people at the centre of securing the country. You can't secure your country with only a security apparatus and missiles.","We have never been colonized, because of our attitude... We have the confidence, the moral authority, and our people are also enough to tell us what they want to tell us."],"Hailey Baldwin":["I would never pose topless.","For me, I like to be a little bit tomboy but still look like a lady. Pretty tough. Or really, really, really pretty.","Acting is in my family. My cousins, my sister, and I always say it's a legacy that should be kept alive. In the future, it's something I really want.","All my tattoos except my first were not planned. I would just go into the shop late at night with friends and ask for something on the spot. My first is my parents' wedding date. I thought it would soften the blow of getting a tattoo.","My style kind of differs - sometimes I want to be a little dressed down, a little tomboy, sometimes I want to be dressed up and very chic and look proper. But I don't ever believe in overdoing it for day-to-day style.","If I get in a dark spot, I'll listen to some Adele and cry about it.","I love making shorts out of jeans, or customizing denim. Basically, I like to rip and distress things... I love that look.","I don't see myself as famous; I see myself as a normal person with a job that is not very normal. My work life is very out there and very public. But I do my best to maintain my privacy.","I think a lot about when times were simpler, when I was still dancing and living with my parents. I really miss living at home sometimes. I get really sad.","I always try to keep one very feminine quality to my style.","For a long time, I said I didn't want to model. I was a dancer.","I was raised in church. I was brought up in that life, and I think that it's very important for everybody to be in touch with their spirituality and to have a relationship with God.","I feel like if you flip through my Instagram, you'll kind of see the same angles and poses every time. That's the trick to having people love your Instagram selfies. It's all about your angles.","I wasn't bullied by the mean girls in high school. I'm just bullied by adults and teenagers all over the world.","The thing is, I live a very public life, and I have to keep things personal, or else I have no personal life. It's very difficult.","I think that God kind of put me in the place in my life to not be quiet about it, not be quiet about Him, but to reach people and to inspire people.","I know a lot of people struggle with the idea of Jesus and their idea of God. I think, if you don't even know what you're praying to or who you're praying to, based on what I know to be true, regardless, God's always listening.","My biggest goal in life will be achieved when I have a family, when I have my own kids that I can raise myself and bring up based on what I know. I always think it's the wildest idea - raising a whole, entire human is insane to me, and I've always wanted kids.","I'm lucky that I have my family, I'm lucky that my parents are still together. Those are the things that I cherish.","I think if I was going to be someone for a day, I would want to be a performer, someone big, like Rihanna. I'd want to feel the energy of being on stage. I've always found that very interesting.","I love New York. It's hard to explain, but it's the energy of the city. It's not like L.A. where everything is spread out.","I genuinely do think that skin does have a lot to do with genetics. I was blessed. You should see my mom and grandma - it's unfair!","I don't like to run. You will not see me running on a treadmill ever. Ever! I like boxing, though, so if I can go to the gym and box for 30 minutes, I will.","I wouldn't ever pose naked... I'm fine to do bikinis and certainly lingerie if I feel it's done tastefully... cute like Victoria's Secret, but nothing like raunchy or overly sexual.","I think trying to maintain a classic pretty style is the way I like to go, like Margot Robbie's style.","The older supermodels sometimes don't agree with the fact there is a new generation of models. We're not saying we're supermodels. I'd rather people look at us as businesspeople, and, yes, modeling is our business right now, but we're not trying to take anybody's spot, and we're not trying to discredit the past.","You can blame my mom for some of my worst fashion moments. She used to dress me and my sister in a lot of patterns. Like, she would put me in striped stockings with a floral dress. Like, why are you doing that to me?","I think the most expensive thing I've bought thus far is my Rolex.","I never want to put my name on something that I don't love or wouldn't wear myself.","Sometimes I Google myself just to see what people are saying. But we all do that. If someone tells you that they don't, then they are lying.","I am obsessed with John Mayer. I love him. I just think he's so talented. I have his documentary in my iTunes. I watch it all the time.","I put castor oil in my eyebrows. And I also tint my eyebrows when I get them cleaned up. That way, I don't have to be constantly filling them in, because I'm lazy.","I don't do facials - I don't really enjoy people picking at my skin. I'd rather a dermatologist who's a doctor for that do that.","I know all the books of the Bible.","Everybody literally thinks I've had plastic surgery. My mom's family call her, and they're like, 'Did Hailey do her lips? Did she do her nose?' Do people want me to go to a doctor and have them examine my face so they can tell people I haven't? My face has just matured. I grew into my looks.","I definitely would not do a reality show.","A cheat day for me, the first thing that I crave, I'll eat. That's my rule. So if I wake up and I want pancakes, I'm gonna eat pancakes. If I want a cheeseburger for lunch or for dinner, I'm gonna eat it. If I want fries, I'm gonna eat the fries.","I love Rihanna. I think her style just pushes a lot of boundaries. My tomboy side takes inspiration from her."],"Hailey Gates":["Some of us are lucky enough to choose what we wear, and some of us don't have that luxury, but we all are communicating something to the world around us by what we wear, no matter if it's sweatpants or a tuxedo.","I never thought I would go to Gaza. It's incredibly difficult to get into, and when you get there, it's a war zone. Then they have this beach, and there's this incredible, vibrant beach culture there, which is something that I grew up with in Southern California.","I have always been very into pagan hairstyles. If I were alive a long time ago, I would probably have been burned at the stake.","I ate better in Liberia than I did in Ohio.","Women's bodies have become a real battleground for politics.","I was, like, a really embarrassing, precocious child.","My parents separated when I was young, and as a result, my father had to learn how to braid our hair on the nights my sisters and I would stay with him. We would arrive to school the next morning with these incredibly endearing lopsided braids he had fashioned. This may have expedited the process of my learning how to braid my own hair.","At one point, we were across the street from the Sharon Tate house; at another, we lived in Elvis's old Bel Air bachelor pad. It was where he first met the Beatles.","I have a 'Mailer-Breslin and the 51st State' poster, and a neon-pink sign of Raoul's in SoHo, one of my favorite restaurants.","In China, I had my body lit on fire. And in Russia, I took a bath in reindeer blood, which apparently had some kind of youth-enhancing elements.","When I was young, I made all of my own clothes.","I would wear entirely one color: tutus, furry pants. It was totally outrageous. My family was deeply embarrassed to be seen with me.","I actually find it a lot easier to interview people I don't agree with because I'm far more curious about how they've arrived at that place.","I'm not a gun person by any stretch of the imagination, and it's not something I feel comfortable participating in.","Fashion is unique. It's a leveler, not a divider.","High fashion has become representative of stability in unstable places; that allows you to have a voice in the world stage.","This idea of 'laicite' has been weaponized, in a way, to discriminate against people, and this idea of who gets to be French is really complicated and interesting.","It's really just my Hammurabi code of journalism ethics, that I don't want to ask someone to do something that I won't do myself.","I think, in a lot of ways, we underestimate how much clothing plays a part in achieving our identities and in how we want the world to deal with us.","If you take the fashion out of it, clothing has a lot of information - about how we feel about ourselves, how we'd like to feel about ourselves, and what we'd like to be: If you show up to an interview in sweatpants and a T-shirt, I'm going to deal with you in a really different way.","The Internet seems to have killed American fashion in the sense that everybody has good style, but they also look vaguely the same.","Maintaining a sense of humor is key to getting people to also focus on the crises at hand.","We did a play of 'Frog and Toad' at my elementary school. And I'm not sure if this is part of the book or it was something that we made up on our own, but I auditioned to play the black hole, which somehow makes sense to me.","I was writing a lot even as a kid.","I always struggle auditioning, actually, because I'm so obsessed with era-appropriate clothing.","A sudden intimacy occurs when someone does your hair.","Having long hair has allowed me to enter orthodox or religiously conservative situations with slightly more ease.","I think why I was attracted to making something with Vice is that level of intimacy that you get as the viewer, getting to see some of that production element where we don't exactly know what we're doing, where we're going, or even if it's a good idea.","There are a lot of people who don't want things like fashion weeks to happen.","It's wild, how many places of conflict that have fashion weeks. It's becoming some sort of marker for these countries that says, 'We are in conversation with the rest of the world.'","The Congo is so fun. The ideal body type coveted by women in the Congo is this extremely curvaceous body. They're going through a number of extreme measures to get that kind of body form, and one of them is by using bouillon cubes.","In China, because Chinese is a tonal language, it can be kind of hard to follow people's emotional tracks. There was one moment where a woman I was interviewing just sort of burst into tears, and I can usually sort of tell when things are coming on, and in that moment, it was very unexpected.","Everybody gets dressed every day, and whatever you decide to get dressed in that morning is communicating something.","Fashion weeks tend to be places of refuge for outsiders.","I'm not a journalist. I have not gone to school for this.","I wrote a play that I directed and I was in, and I paid for the sets and the costumes and to put it up in a theater all through modeling. It really afforded me a lot of creative control in my life."],"Haim Ginott":["Parents often talk about the younger generation as if they didn't have anything to do with it.","Teachers are expected to reach unattainable goals with inadequate tools. The miracle is that at times they accomplish this impossible task.","If you want your children to improve, let them overhear the nice things you say about them to others.","Each of us carries within himself a collection of instant insults."],"Hakan Nesser":["Writing is a creative process, and you need to have the doors and windows of your mind open so that you have the possibility of change.","A good story can travel in time and borders; it hits you no matter where you are.","I like the slow Scandinavian pace. I don't need cliffhangers in every chapter because I don't want to make a Hollywood movie out of it.","I was a late bloomer. I was 38 when my first book was out and 43 when my first crime novel was out. I had a story that could only be told as a crime story. I think the genre is good; it deals with the fundamental questions of life and death. The problem is there are too many bad crime stories.","There are 195 crime books published in Sweden every year. You could cut that to 100 and keep the good ones.","It is difficult to survive as an author in Sweden, so for commercial success, it is good idea to write crime, get yourself translated, and live happily ever after.","I am not a political writer. I agree with Stieg Larsson and Henning Mankell, who are social writers. I can't write in that fashion. I am not good enough for that. What I am interested in is family dramas and why we are doing bad things to each other and what our motives are.","If you want to start reading Swedish crime fiction, you have to start with Sjowall and Wahloo.","While I'm writing, I'm also the first reader, and I want to write a book where I'm excited about what happens next.","You should never ask, 'What would the readers like now?' Instead, you should ask, 'What would I like if I was a reader?' And then you must trust your own mind."],"Hakeem Jeffries":["Newark might be one of few the places where the politics is tougher than even Brooklyn.","During my time as a state legislator, I've pushed for significant investment in public school districts. In Congress, I would look forward to increasing federal public investment in education through initiatives like Race to the Top.","In Congress, I'll work hard to encourage investment in education, particularly with respect to technology and bridging the digital divide.","My job in Congress is to identify projects with federal or some other public component and then to push developers to provide employment opportunities to neighborhood residents.","The political process is rough and tumble by definition, and being grounded in faith in a Higher Power has proven helpful in navigating the difficult terrain."],"Hakeem Olajuwon":["Allah says in the Qur'an not to despise one another. So the criterion in Islam is not color or social status. It's who is most righteous. If I go to a mosque - and I'm a basketball player with money and prestige - if I go to a mosque and see an imam, I feel inferior. He's better than me. It's about knowledge.","When you get to that level, it's not a matter of talent anymore - because all the players are so talented - it's about preparation, about playing smart and making good decisions.","All these boundaries - Africa, Asia, Malaysia, America - are set by men. But you don't have to look at boundaries when you are looking at a man - at the character of a man. The question is: What do you stand for? Are you a follower, or are you a leader?","I'm the kind of person who always wants more.","I'm the kind of person who always wants more. I was successful materially, but I know life is much more than worldly success. I saw all these blessings God had given me. The way to give thanks is obedience to God.","Basketball is in my blood. It is my obligation to try.","I was successful materially, but I know life is much more than worldly success. I saw all these blessings God had given me. The way to give thanks is obedience to God.","I'm shy, but sometimes my voice is so clear and strong.","I always keep a ball in the car. You never know.","My type of basketball is about how to create space, how to maneuver, how to get your shot off.","I've now been in this country for thirteen years, since I was seventeen. So this is my second home.","I'm shy, but sometimes my voice is so clear and strong. Your tongue moves, and the Arabic language is so beautiful.","I don't think Michael had to retire for us to get the spotlight, because when you win, it commands attention.","Being from Africa is the best thing that could have ever, ever happened to me. I cannot see it any other way. All of my fundamental principles that were instilled in me in my home, from my childhood, are still with me.","When I look at the system here and look at my position - not just as a basketball player, but when I look around me at the values of the people and the culture and compare them with the values of where I came from - I feel so blessed to be from Africa.","I remember at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, Shaq always wanted me to show him steps over and over.","My background playing soccer gave me a natural advantage over many of the American-born players.","God comes first. Paradise is not cheap.","The key to fashion is, you don't want to look like you're trying. You've gotta be natural.","The difference must be distinguished between worship and respect. Islam orders you to obey and respect, as long as you are not worshiping anything other than God... Islam is a religion of peace. You don't attack. You explain.","I love fashion as much as I love basketball! It is a great joy for me to express myself through designing my own collection."],"Hal Ashby":["I basically have a very positive philosophy of life, because I don't feel I have anything to lose. Most things are going to turn out okay.","I don't like to tell lies."],"Hal Borland":["Summer is a promissory note signed in June, its long days spent and gone before you know it, and due to be repaid next January.","Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence.","If you would know strength and patience, welcome the company of trees.","No winter lasts forever; no spring skips its turn.","Man is wise and constantly in quest of more wisdom; but the ultimate wisdom, which deals with beginnings, remains locked in a seed. There it lies, the simplest fact of the universe and at the same time the one which calls forth faith rather than reason.","A woodland in full color is awesome as a forest fire, in magnitude at least, but a single tree is like a dancing tongue of flame to warm the heart.","You can't be suspicious of a tree, or accuse a bird or a squirrel of subversion or challenge the ideology of a violet.","April is a promise that May is bound to keep.","Year's end is neither an end nor a beginning but a going on, with all the wisdom that experience can instill in us.","Summer ends, and Autumn comes, and he who would have it otherwise would have high tide always and a full moon every night.","October is the fallen leaf, but it is also a wider horizon more clearly seen. It is the distant hills once more in sight, and the enduring constellations above them once again.","A snowdrift is a beautiful thing - if it doesn't lie across the path you have to shovel or block the road that leads to your destination.","The ultimate wisdom which deals with beginnings, remains locked in a seed. There it lies, the simplest fact of the universe and at the same time the one which calls faith rather than reason."],"Hal Boyle":["What makes a river so restful to people is that it doesn't have any doubt - it is sure to get where it is going, and it doesn't want to go anywhere else.","Professors simply can't discuss a thing. Habit compels them to deliver a lecture.","We need not worry so much about what man descends from - it's what he descends to that shames the human race."],"Hal David":["One thing a lyricist must learn is not to fall in love with his own lines. Once you learn that, you can walk away from the lyric and look at it with a reasonable degree of objectivity.","In writing, I search for believability, simplicity and emotional impact.","It's not just a revue where one song is done, then another. There are concepts and ideas at work.","Pop songs are not as graceful as they used to be. Performers today haven't gone through the regimen of learning how to write. And of course, everyone wants to own copyrights.","Rap culture is interesting and different and has purpose but it has a non-romantic view of life and of social feelings. There may be a void in that.","The talent is always there and art is cyclical. I'm optimistic.","Above all, I try to create an emotion to which others can respond."],"Hal Holbrook":["Man looks in the abyss, there's nothing staring back at him. At that moment, man finds his character. And that is what keeps him out of the abyss.","I got a feeling about political correctness. I hate it. It causes us to lie silently instead of saying what we think.","I developed a resistance to authority. Not to discipline - I learned that. But to authority. I like to think for myself. And I like to cause trouble.","One of the problems with putting Huck Finn into a movie or on the stage is, you always make the white people stupid and racist. The point is, they don't know they're racist.","To communicate with each other, we got to get mad at each other sometimes.","You can go into Mark Twain's material and prove anything you want. He was against war. He was for war. He was against rich people and he was for them. He was a kaleidoscope.","I don't have a director. The audience directs me.","I have a suicide impulse.","I like to be who I am.","Man is the religious animal. He is the only one that's got true religion, several of them.","Mark Twain cannot be defined.","There's no good guys and bad guys.","We don't have truth delivered to us very often, especially in this very commercialized world.","We live in a democracy. We have this extraordinary opportunity to use our mind and say what we think, speak as we think. Sometimes what we say is objectionable to other people. But that is part of a free society."],"Hal Linden":["I hadn't really noticed that I had a hearing problem. I just thought most people had given up on speaking clearly.","I challenge myself everywhere, onstage, on the golf course. Hey, isn't that the point of it all? To keep getting better? Otherwise why do it?","I rarely repeat playing the same role in a show. I figured I'd plumbed 90 percent the first time around, so let's move on to something where I'm starting from scratch."],"Hal Lindsey":["We are very near the final climactic events that end with the Second Coming of Christ.","The most important sign in Matthew has to be the restoration of the Jews to the land in the rebirth of Israel.","When the Jewish people, after nearly 2,000 years of exile, under relentless persecution, became a nation again on 14 May 1948 the 'fig tree' put forth its first leaves. Jesus said that this would indicate that He was 'at the door,' ready to return.","I didn't ask to be a hero, but I guess I have become one in the Christian community. So I accept it. But if I'm wrong about this, I guess I'll become a bum.","Twenty years ago, I said there was going to be something that would stop the Soviet Union from taking over the world. And now we see that the Soviet Union has been stopped, through its own disintegration."],"Hal Newhouser":["Never give up, and never give in.","I know the Hall of Fame is the more sought-after thing. But I'm getting a bigger charge out of my uniform number being put away. Everything I worked hard for and wished for came true.","I remember one game when I pitched in Yankee Stadium and gave up five runs in the first inning. It would have been easy to quit, but I shut 'em out the rest of the way, and we came back and won the game.","What more can you ask for than to see a ballgame in spring?","Al Kaline bought a tee and a ball and swung at it all winter. Look where it got him: the Hall of Fame.","I think what hurt me all along was the label of 'war-time pitcher.' I've always resented that."],"Hal Price":["It costs a great deal of money to do a musical, and the more money involved, the more big business influences the artform.","I do know one thing: I wish people were doing more dangerous musicals, more courageous musicals and not just falling into the trap of trying to figure out what the public wants, because you find out that the public very often wants what's good.","I'm looking for one of two things and sometimes they dovetail: I'm looking to go into a theatre and see a certain kind of show. And if it's not there, I'd like to do it myself so it would be there.","There's a need to keep the history of an artform going, parallel with the new work that's being done."],"Hal Roach":["The greatest comedies that were made by anybody were made in two reels; I don't care who it was.","Harold Lloyd was not a comedian. But he was the finest actor to play a comedian that I ever saw.","You can't make people laugh for more than half an hour and be consistent.","The important thing, once you get 'em laughing, is to keep 'em laughing until you're through. With a 90-minute feature, you've got to stop the laughter and then pick it up again, which is tough."],"Hal Rogers":["In my district, I know we have thousands of little creeks and streams, some of which only fill up when it rains. Nationwide, they're in the tens of thousands.","It seems the EPA has worked hard to devise new regulations that are designed to eliminate coal mining, coal burning, usage of coal."],"Hal Sparks":["People think that the arts are optional and they aren't. They teach a level of emotional depth that's equally important to mathematic skill. You can replace some math skills with a calculator if you know how to operate the thing, but there's no calculator for human interaction.","It's better to waste money, than it is to waste time. You can always get more money.","If I could sew comedy and philosophy together, then I've done a good job. The primary goal is always going to be laughs and the secondary goal is always going to be saying something without it being a lecture. I think it's important to have substance for what you're saying.","Tori Amos had a major influence on how I craft words in a song. Until I heard 'Little Earthquakes' all my lyrics used really obvious analogies like rain for tears.","If you take anything I say with any seriousness whatsoever, go study Yang style tai chi. It will make you live longer.","It's better to waste money than time. You can always get more money.","If you are for freedom and equal rights, which we hear a lot of talk about these days, then you have to include the LGBTQ community in that. And if you're not willing to put your time where your mouth is, then I don't know quite what you mean by commitment in your life.","I try to be as ignorant about things as I can.","Anyone who still supports George Bush would still let Michael Jackson babysit their kids.","Growing up in Kentucky, I used to hang out with four running buddies as a kid - 6, 10, and 11 years old. Two of them would later come out, and so 50 percent of my friends as a kid were gay.","Jerry Springer' is just kind of the chubby, redneck version of throwing Christians to the lions.","You'd think after 8 years of things called 'The Patriot Act' and 'No Child Left Behind' they would know that we have figured out the 'Call it what it ain't' PR ploy by now, but... um... no.","Vegas has the Whitman's Sampler of audiences. They come from all different places, so you have to do some crowd psychology. You have to find the heartbeat of the room. It doesn't shift my jokes, but it shifts my timing and my attention.","Most 'reality' shows aren't reality at all. They're game shows with no prize. Like 'Rock of Love.' His aren't genuine feelings. Then again, Bob Barker didn't really care whether or not you won the toaster. Sorry to shatter everyone's dreams.","If 'Airplane!' comes on, it's like a comfort film. You can always guarantee a laugh watching that movie.","I've been doing stand-up since I was 15 years old.","The name 'Charmageddon' actually comes from a social technique that I use. Which is, you know, literally obliterating people with charm so that you can get away with saying stuff that no one else could ever get away with, you know?","There is never hesitation about doing stand-up. It's just me doing my thing. Unlike being in a band or a play or something, I don't have to rely on anyone else but me.","I noticed a lot of guitar players neglected the rhythm part of rhythm guitar and decided I would try to focus in that. As my skill and knowledge of the instrument grew, I found lead started to come naturally. Sometimes I play guitar like a frustrated drummer. Ha ha!","You would not believe how much time people waste in a day. And how little time they put into things they genuinely love.","As a stand up, and often in acting, there is no place for the most intense feelings. Rage, genuine sorrow, naked hope... These things don't fit on a comedy stage and if you act you'll get to express them once in a while. Music is a place for the intensely personal.","I'm as heterosexual as any person need be. I'm open about my relationships - or lack thereof - in my own life, because I want to make the case that gay isn't contagious. It's not something that you can catch or learn or choose.","'Cold Case Files' and similar shows do bang up business, which points to a certain thirst for details in the viewership, but it seems like all the news chat shows continue to force the myth that Americans can't stand detail and have no interest in an idea that can't fit on a bumper sticker.","Someone needs to remind American CEOs that if you can't run a company that is innovative, financially sound and doesn't poison the rest of us, You can't run a company.","Political and social change is always a stagger-step process. One step forward, two steps back. They want you to give up.","I'm a futurist. Technology is our way out of almost every problem we have. Technology can create a new sense of community.","Other kids would sneak out of the house to go to parties and do untoward things. I was sneaking out to do standup downtown.

Unless they still live with their parents, I guess. I'm just lucky that my day job is simply another form of art.","The important thing is having genuine regard for your audience.","If I could sew comedy and philosophy together, then I've done a good job. The primary goal is always going to be laughs and the secondary goal is always going to be saying something without it being a lecture.","The pop musicians often leave meaning in the dust and substitute it for cartoons. The deeper artists - the grunge artists in the world and the emoticon people - tend to leave all of the happiness out of life like it just doesn't exist.","There is never hesitation about doing stand-up.

Then you should feel guilty because you're killing your body and that's something to be guilty about.","Truth be told, ginormous portions have become a pet peeve of mine.","Mainly, when I go see a show, unfortunately it's more industrial espionage than it is going to actually enjoy a show.","I'm a writer, so I like dissecting things."],"Hal Stratton":["Back in the 1960s, the number of deaths each year from unintentional poisoning was 15 times greater than it is today.","Companies need to understand that the quicker they report product safety problems to CPSC, the quicker we can take action together and protect consumers from injuries."],"Hal Sutton":["We are reminded how short life really is, and how we are just passing through. So, all the people you haven't told you love lately, tell them, and live your days like you mean it.","Jim played - he had a great stretch in the middle of the round there, and Chad made that long putt on 16. Almost got that match. We ended up losing, but we almost won it, too.","Chad was in the right spot. He got a little aggressive with the third shot there. He probably didn't want that putt he had there for the par. And you don't want to put it back there where Casey and Sergio did because you have 20 feet of break there.","I am excited about this. We've got half of our goal. I'd love to see us get a little bit more than half our goal and not be so deeply into this thing going into Sunday, but I feel good about everything.","I don't feel badly about that. There's a lot of energy on the golf course. The guys are playing great. I like the pairings in the afternoon. I'm going to take what we've got.","I feel good. I think everything went good.","I had a really good feeling about that match. You know, they are good friends, and Chris had to feel really relaxed because of being out there with Tiger.","I hope we've got a lot of fairways and greens. We'll go from there.","I thought we had energy out there. I thought the guys were, they played good, they were excited. We were almost dynamite out there today. Just a flicker away from being dynamite.","Put Mickelson and Toms out there. You know, they had the morning off. They rested. Knowing them and the competitors that they are, they are probably a little angry that they weren't out there in the morning.","That's the $64,000 question. And I would love to tell you there was an answer."],"Haldan Keffer Hartline":["Alfred Nobel was much concerned, as are we all, with the tangible benefits we hope for and expect from physiological and medical research, and the Faculty of the Caroline Institute has ever been alert to recognize practical benefits.","But what is more, if we have succeeded in adding to the basic understanding of our universe and ourselves, we will have made a contribution to the totality of human culture.","One is that we stand - my two confreres and I - in some degree as representatives of a great number of fellow workers over the entire world, who are enthusiastically active in this field of ours.","One works in one's laboratory - one's chaotic laboratory - with students and colleagues, doing what one most wants to do - then all this happens! It is overwhelming.","Scientists care deeply about their place in that culture, and their contribution to it."],"Hale Irwin":["I never underestimate my opponent, but I never underestimate my talents.","I can forgive the body breaking down. It's a little tougher to forgive that mental lapse.","If you're not just a little bit nervous before a match, you probably don't have the expectations of yourself that you should have.","I just never subscribed to the theory that at age 55, you fall off the face of the earth on the Tour. I always felt that was too young of an age for that.","Yes, I applied a lot of what I did in football to golf.","The positions I played in football, being a quarterback and a defensive back, you had to kind of have a little independent thinking.","My dad was a good athlete. My mom had longevity. There were some athletic genes that certainly got passed down.","I've felt that if you dwell too much on your errors, you're dealing in the negativity of things. I don't like that. I'd rather work on the positive reinforcement, the things I did well.","People, in whatever walk of life, would be surprised if they just gave themselves a chance by believing in what they are.","Do I want to tackle a 230-pound guy who's running like a deer? Heavens no, no one in their right mind would. But there is something that drives me and compels me to stick my head in there and give it my best shot.","I don't sleep well. I rehash everything in bed. The mind's still working.","People have to learn who they are - you can't have somebody else telling you who you are.","Feeling tired should almost never be an excuse, because your body has huge reserves of energy.

And they can't understand why the Obama administration or the Democrat majority in Congress wants to pass a bill like the cap-and-trade tax that will cost us jobs, that will hurt our economy, that will drive up costs for families, as well as for small businesses.","I think the American people are very smart in understanding our country is very trustworthy with nuclear weapons. We've had them from the beginning. But they have also been critical for keeping the world more at peace than it would have been if it hadn't been for the American nuclear umbrella.","The Obama administration and the Democratic Congress have taken the biggest lurch to the left in policy in American history. There've been no - no Congress, no administration that has run this far to the left in such a small period of time. And there is a reaction to that.","There's no recovery on Main Street, I can tell you that for sure. And in a re - in an economy like this, we don't need to be raising anybody's taxes.","I'm a lobbyist and had a career lobbying. The guy who gets elected or the lady who gets elected president of the United States will immediately be lobbying. They would be advocating to the Congress, they'll be lobbying our allies and our adversaries overseas. They'll be asking the business community and labor unions.","I have a record as governor. I have a record of cutting spending. And I talked yesterday not only about we ought to cut spending, I talked about how we've cut spending in Mississippi and how if you did the same things in the federal government, you would save tens of billions of dollars a year.","When I became governor, spending actually increased 28 percent my first term. Revenue increased 42 percent my first term without raising anybody's taxes. We did it because we had more taxpayers with more taxable income. That's how you get the revenue up. We did that without raising anybody's taxes."],"Haley Bennett":["I have a tendency to lean towards a more retro look.","I've always been a dreamer.","I think it's important to surrender to situations that take you out of your comfort zone.","I'm attracted to the rag & bone aesthetic - classic and effortless with an edge.","Rag & bone images always reflect the authenticity of the brand. Their images have character and tell a story.","We all have fears, especially when we're younger. I was afraid of clowns.","I didn't grow up a huge fan of the Western genre because there was never a female character to relate to or look up to.","I think it's very refreshing to see women in cinema having strength and their own independent storyline.","I used to be a night owl. I no longer am a night owl.","My dad would take me deer hunting with him, which was pretty traumatic - 'Bambi' was one of my favorite movies.","I didn't have a long-term plan or goal. If there would have been a road map showing me the way to my dreams becoming reality, I might have given it a second thought.","I'm pretty mad at horror films for ruining my childhood.","I was obsessed with clowns.

I thought there were clowns under my bed for years.","I never imagined what it would be like to spend a 12-hour day crying and covered in blood.","I shot 'Girl' about three weeks after I finished 'The Magnificent Seven.'","Thank God for product and blusher.","When I'm out the street, I get people whispering behind me, 'Isn't that Jennifer Lawrence?' I should start doing autographs - although if you stood us side by side, you wouldn't make that mistake.","Pioneer women were very tough - they had to be, because the men go off for long periods of time, and the women would have to be able to protect themselves and their homes.","I think that, a lot of times in Hollywood pictures, the reality, the messy reality of women's lives - it's avoided, because I think people are just afraid of it. There's a standard that women are set to, to try to keep everybody comfortable.","I think, by nature, human beings are curious. And I think that's only amplified as an artist.","I think to try to understand human behavior and why people do what they do, and what in their lives have shaped them and impacted them to be who they are, it's something. I mean, that's my entire life.","I'm very happy with the choices I've been making and the people I've been working with. I hope I can continue along this path.","I have a thousands wants; it's hard to really hone in on just a few.","I want to have a long career.","I prefer clean silhouettes that are almost utilitarian, but I'm not afraid to take risks on the red carpet, either.","I love to dress up and create a narrative with my look.","I like to accentuate the feminine form, so I'm a big fan of corsets. A woman's body is beautiful and should be shown off and celebrated. I love a simple and elegant dress that highlights my waist.","I struggled for many, many years following 'Music and Lyrics' - I mean really struggled.","I always wanted to do things on my own terms, and unfortunately in this industry, that's not something that is easily given. You're at the mercy of other people, but then you still have that drive to continue on. That's an equation for a lot of heartbreak.","My mom was an artist, and she had this amazing ability to transform everything into something beautiful.","It is so funny because I was always embarrassed because I never had formal training in acting.","I basically grew up in the backwoods.","I went through a really dorky phase.","There was no time when I lived anywhere longer than two years. I was always a social outcast. Maybe I didn't care what people thought because I was like, 'Well, I probably won't stick around here for too long.'","I don't know that I'll ever get to make my ideal film, because Frank Capra is dead.","I lived somewhat of a nomadic life, even when I lived in Ohio. We spent time in rural areas, in suburban areas, never really city areas. We rode four-wheelers. We had pigs and ferrets. And creeks. We had a creek in my backyard. It was like 'Huckleberry Finn.'","Before 'Music and Lyrics,' I was just doing high school plays and singing in my church choir and my school choir.","I tried to play sports, which was a disaster and probably one of the reasons I ended up being an actress.","If acting doesn't work out, I'm probably going to be a professional chef.","You'll see me on 'Top Chef' someday. My Midwestern hospitality needs an outlet, you know?","I was so terrified before an audience that I would break out in these ugly red hives, and my lips would quiver at the sight of a word or a song.","My dad was a single father, and he was a hunter.","I learned how to shoot when I was pretty little.","I get recognized all the time, but not as Haley Bennett.","I like the idea of having a superordinary life.","There's not a formula that I'm following; it's just how I feel at the time. For instance, I did a very experimental film called 'Hardcore Henry,' and that was simply because I thought the filmmaker was very interesting and a risk taker. A film like that had never been made before, so I chose to do that at the time.","Doing 'Magnificent Seven' was a no-brainer.","You can't sit here and try to predict what kind of character I'm going to be drawn to next. At the time when I read 'The Girl on the Train,' it wasn't like I was, 'Ooh, I want to play a hot mess next.'","Being nomadic isn't sustainable forever. I've gotten to be really good at it.","All I came to Los Angeles with was a dream. No one from my family ever left Ohio.","My siblings were pretty far apart in age, so I sort of grew up as an only child.","You typically find stereotypical female characters that are people pleasers, where they are wives and girlfriends, typically, who are in the background.","I think the more experience I have working on films, the more I can shed that character rather than carrying around that heavy weight.","Movies are really hard to make. You put a lot of work into them, and you want people to see them.","For any actor - not just talking about myself - but if you've been fortunate enough to work for a long period of time, there's going to be different choices you're going to make."],"Haley Joel Osment":["What attracted me to New York was there was an anonymity that I couldn't always have in Los Angeles, and it was easier to blend in there. The more successful you are, the less you are able to do that.","It's kind of comfortable portraying characters who are kind of unsavoury and not so nice. That can be refreshing sometimes.","With 'The Sixth Sense,' my dad and I discussed how this was not so much a horror story as a story about communication. I understudied with my dad, in a sense. It made a huge difference.","That professionalism comes from what I've watched people do on the set. I'm just trying to be as respectful to the environment, as they have been. I think I still act like a kid. I just try to be as professional as I can.","The best advice my dad ever gave me is that acting is believing. Acting is not acting. It isn't putting on a face and dancing around in a mask. It's believing that you are that character and playing him as if it were a normal day in the life of that character.","Having that college experience and a social life that didn't revolve around Hollywood was absolutely crucial.","I really don't care if people know who I am or what's said about me.","When I was five, I went on my first audition. It was for a Pizza Hut commercial.","Just keep learning from the role and not just go for the money.","I'm going to try and model myself after Kurt Russell and Jodie Foster.","My favorite place is Central Park because you never know what you're going to find there. I also like that when I look out the windows of surrounding hotels, it's seems like I'm looking out over a forest.","I like normal stuff people fear - like spiders and heights. I'm frightened by the unknown, by things that are hard to figure out and get a grip on.","I try to keep away from being big-headed. That's what causes people to lose the acting thing. They start being commercial, and then they stink for the rest of their lives.","For me, choice is the most important thing because I'm going to be an adult actor pretty soon. So I've got to be choosing the right roles now so that by the time I get to that age there will be wide options available.","It's hard to act terrified when you have 200 crew members around you.","Acting is not acting. It isn't putting on a face and dancing around in a mask. It's believing that you are that character and playing him as if it were a normal day in the life of that character.","Kobe Bryant is my favorite basketball player. He takes risks. He goes for the shot. He isn't cautious with whatever he does.","People love to get scared. People want to see the worst thing that can happen.","My dad never told me that when you audition, you might not get the role. He wanted to wait until my first disappointment to tell me.","When I was a little kid, I loved imagining things. I'd go outside and put on a cape and just imagine I was somebody else.","There's so much to learn about acting and performance in general... I mean, acting is a very complex art, and there are a lot more theories and methods and techniques to it than I think anybody would think.","You always have to avoid working for the sake of putting yourself out there.","I've never had a MySpace or a Facebook page. I avoid that entirely.","My parents never got carried away with the extraneous elements of being in the business.","I would be a terrible person to be in a relationship with because I'm either sleeping or at the theater.","The notion of self-care for people who have hundreds of millions of dollars, it doesn't seem like a radical thing.","I'm not a stand-up comedian. I'm not an improv person or anything, but I've always been a fan of that stuff.","I went to New York University to study experimental theatre in 2006 and was there pretty consistently until 2011.","It was kind of good that I wasn't doing the Hollywood high life and stuff like that when I was 18, 19, 20, 21.","I've done some really off-the-wall stuff and stuff that people might not expect. That's one way to work through people's expectations of you.","My parents were both born in Birmingham, Alabama, and come from large Catholic families with lots of Michaels, Marks, and Patricks, so they wanted to choose two names that I don't think you could find anywhere else in the family tree: Haley and Joel.","My mom teaches sixth grade and also taught first grade at one point. She's into dressing up and costumes and designing her own curriculum that way. She stayed home for about eight years with me and my sister when we were young before going back to teaching, so we had a lot of time with her. She taught us to read really early.","A script like 'The Sixth Sense' is fun to read: It's so well-written, and you get a vivid sense of what's going to be onscreen.","I had a flip phone until I was 25, and I didn't use social media until that age, either.","With my dad coming from a theatre tradition, there was a lot of preparation before auditions. Not just in terms of saying the lines correctly but a process of entering into what it was all about.","A film like 'The Sixth Sense' burns an image of who you are into people's minds.","What I like least about acting is that when you're only in one place, you're missing the other part of life.","I try to steer away from doing something that's just commercial instead of sticking to a good script.","One challenge in this industry is that you adopt a certain look for a movie, and then people don't get to see the movie for a year!","People hear the examples of kids who work when they're young, have bad experiences, and then have a rough life after that, but a lot of it is just about the people around you.","Every character I approach, from 'Forrest Gump' all the way up to 'The Spoils Before Dying,' has a different set of requirements and always fascinates me.","When you get lucky, as I did getting to work on a series of amazing films, one of the drawbacks career-wise is that the image of you at 10 or 12 or whatever is burned into people's minds for a long time.","My parents are from the South - they were both born in Birmingham - so my dad saw R.E.M. really early on when they were playing college stuff in Athens. He had a bunch of their cassettes from the '80s, and when I was 8, 9, or 10, those were the sort of things that were around the cassette player in the living room.","Actually, 'Die Hard' was the first movie I ever saw in the theater. When I was a newborn, my parents were going stir-crazy in the house, and they put me in the bassinet, and I slept through 'Die Hard' in the theater as an infant.","Comedy can be harder because if you aren't making the audience laugh, they're going to turn on you quicker. They'll go along with mediocre drama more than they'll go along with mediocre comedy.","One of the cool things about getting to audition for things on short notice is that it teaches you to memorize efficiently. So I've never been afraid of getting text down quickly.","I think a lot of actors will tell you that playing a villain can be more fun than playing the straight and narrow good guy.","I went to the Experimental Theater Wing at NYU and wrote and directed a small amount of stuff there.","When you're a kid, and you grow up, it takes some time for people to associate you with more things other than that initial thing."],"Haley Lu Richardson":["A lot of people get stereotyped into roles just from how they look, and I have played such a variety of characters.","My head is in the game! Like 'High School Musical' taught me. I know what I want, and I know, too, now that you take your craft seriously, but you don't have to take yourself seriously.","I moved when I was 16. I had no clue what to expect in moving to L.A. I had no clue, really, about what acting was. I just knew that I wanted to do it.","I was always the smallest role in community theater and school plays. I always had two lines - I was the kid that came on stage and said one thing and then left, and that was my part for the play.","I had a stunt double for 'The Bronze.' She's literally the most amazing human being I've ever seen. She's NCAA women's gymnastics champion. She was incredible. I would poke her thighs, and my nail would break because it was like poking a rock.","I'm lucky because I had blonde hair for a while for this TV show I was doing - they had me dye my hair blonde - and every audition I was going out for was bleach blonde. The mean girl, the pretty girlfriend, and the dumb cheerleader."],"Haley Reinhart":["If I were to categorize what I sing, I have many different influences, and a lot of them are from back in time.","First thing I did when I found out I made it into the top 13 is I tried not to faint and you know, I took it all in and I really looked at the crowd and said a big 'thank you'.","I love classic rock, rock and roll, that's the top notch. I love soul - bluesy music as well.","If my life had to be a song I would name it, 'Live every day like its your best day ever', because it pretty much is.","I definitely I prefer to sing in the car. I don't sing in the shower, maybe its because that's the one time I don't need to talk to anyone so I should just shut up, otherwise I'm just, you know, jibber jabber.","I'd rather have people really be able to step back and get their money's worth and look at me as a true artist than somebody who is just regurgitating other material.","My parents have been with me every step of the way.","Depth on different levels is so important to me. You look at a band like The Beatles, all their material has so much depth to it. And I want people to be able to run away with my melodies and get lost in them and take the lyrics and be able to relate to them.","My folks have played everything from rock, disco, pop, funk, and blues. My dad has always brought and played different genres like jazz, classical, and Latin. With all this in my pocket, I feel I have a taste of everything for my influences.","I believe a great performer is someone who sounds just as great live as they do in the studio and vice versa. They should know how to work the stage.","Music continues to remind me that its boundaries are limitless.","Music is not just a part of my everday life, I'm surrounded by it every minute.","The kind of audience I'm speaking to is a very wide range of people.","I'm going for something very raw and organic.","My parents have basically just taught me the rules of the stage and everything since I was eight.","It's always been a dream of mine to get somewhere and to have my mom and dad with me up there.","Performing on stage is what I've done since I was a kid and it's where the passion that has started from the very beginning for me, and that's what I'm going to enjoy.","If there's a pool I love to hangout there and layout and get some sun. If I can ever find a second to get some sun, some Vitamin D, I will do so."],"Haley Webb":["I will never give up my dream of being a prima ballerina and backup dancer for Justin Timberlake!","I'm currently working on a romantic comedy between me and Philip Seymour Hoffman. So my next step is to write something so mind-blowingly spectacular that he has no other choice but to agree to do it! Wish me luck.","I work like a dog, really. I go over scripts like a mad man and just want to make sure I have my house built, so that I can just kind of go nuts inside of it.","For the most part, I do a lot of my own stunts. On 'The Final Destination,' they kept pulling my stunt woman in, and I'd shoo her away. I'm a black belt in tae kwon do, so I was adamant about doing stuff myself."],"Halima Aden":["For a really long time, I thought being different was a negative thing. But as I grew older, I started to realize we were all born to stand out; nobody is born to blend in.","Always stay true to who you are - barriers can and will be broken!","Diversity and inclusion are always something industries should strive for.","I used to be so self-conscious about my braces that people thought I was shy - I just never talked. It took me a long time to realize, whatever, it's not like I'll have them forever, so I might as well enjoy it while I do!","Skin care is so much more important than makeup. Makeup is for when you're having fun and going out. But your skin is forever.","There's always room to volunteer. I think that's a huge space to be involved with.","For me, being able to say that my first-ever photo shoot was with one of the most well-known and iconic fashion photographers in the world is unbelievable.","Be who you are. It's easy to feel like you have to blend in, but it takes courage to live your life with conviction and embrace the person that you are.","My goal is to send a message to Muslim women and young women everywhere that it's okay to break stereotypes and be yourself.","I made a lot of mistakes growing up, trying so hard to fit in. I got so lost trying to please everybody.","I have much more to offer than my physical appearance, and a hijab protects me against 'You're too skinny,' 'You're too thick,' 'Look at her hips,' 'Look at her thigh gap.' I don't have to worry about that.","I don't want to be taller; I want to be myself.","My favorite part of modeling is backstage. Every day you work with different people, and as much as people learn about my story, I get to learn about theirs.","I love Somali foods like canjeero, a pancakelike bread; same for pizza, burgers, and sushi.","Sometimes I'll go with a long hijab, or sometimes I'll wear my scarf and go somewhat business-y with a blazer. Every day is something new.","My mom and grandma, growing up, one thing they emphasized was that you need to make sure that anything you put on your skin is also digestible by the body. For example, if something isn't safe for me to eat or consume, it's probably not good for your face. So I do a lot of natural remedies.","There are so many Muslim women that feel like they don't fit society's standard of beauty. I just wanted to tell them it's OK to be different; being different is beautiful, too.","A lot of people had a misconception that I would be the perfect poster child for Islam. So I got a lot of Instagram comments like, 'Oh, you don't have your neck covered, you're not a Muslim!' My thing is, stop judging women, especially if you're a man, because you don't know the responsibility that comes with wearing a hijab.","I want to go see Somalia because I've never been there, and I feel like I'm missing out. I want to learn that heritage; I want to learn about my culture.","I feel like I'm here to bust those misconceptions and stereotypes of Muslim women.","Being Somali, being Muslim, it's always something I've been very proud of.","People I looked up to a lot were, you know, Oprah because she had a rough childhood but overcame so many obstacles and broke barriers to become who she is. It was really eye opening to me: just because I had a rough childhood doesn't mean that I can't make something of myself.","What I have learned is that designers are willing to tell the world that they are here to empower women from all different backgrounds and different walks of life.","I learned that when you stand up for what you believe in, you'll get a lot of support. But there are always going to be negative things said about you.","The hijab is a symbol that we wear on our heads, but I want people to know that it is my choice. I'm doing it because I want to do it. I wanted people to see that you could still be really cute and modest at the same time.","You don't let being the first to do it stop you or get in the way.","I am Minnesotan.","I did notice growing up that there are so many things, obstacles and things, that people think you can't do because you're Muslim or because you're wearing a hijab. You hear a lot of no's. That was something that I wanted to see change.","I feel bad for my little cousins who don't see themselves being represented, or the little girls in my community who won't have a chance to see a Disney princess... who resembles them.","I haven't received any pressure to be anything other than myself, and for that, I am so grateful.","When you have a lot of women in our state that do wear the hijab, we should be able to see that everywhere.","A lot of people will look at you and will fail to see your beauty because you're covered up and they're not used to it. So growing up, I just had to work on my people skills and give people a chance to really know me besides the clothing.","When people put labels on us, it doesn't always enclose everything that we are. So even though I'm proud to be Somali, I'm proud to be American, at the end of the day, I'm still Halima, and I take things from both sides and combine them, and I make my own little category. I'm me!","If you think people are against you and that you're a target, things will start appearing that way. I just go about my day, and I don't think anyone is out to get me.","Every little girl looks up to her mom so much - that's your first hero.","Society puts so much pressure on girls to look a certain way.","Moisturizing every night is important. When you're 50 or 60, it's going to show if you don't take care of it. You have to prepare when you're young, so you still have that healthy, glowing skin when you're 60 or 70.","Product-wise, I use a morning and night cleanser. I'm really not a brand person.","I say this all the time, but my hijab, it really is my crown, and it's something that I bring to the table. It's something that makes me unique. It shows the world who I truly am.","I feel like with anything you choose to do in this world, there are always gonna be people who disagree. But I've had a lot more supporters than critics.","I choose to focus on the positive.","A lot of people have the misconception that, as a Muslim woman, I am somehow against women wearing bikinis. No, I want women to feel comfortable and confident in whatever they wear.","If there's one message I want people to take away is never compromise being your authentic self. Even if that means making others uncomfortable.","When I was younger, I didn't have that type of person that I could look up to and be like, 'OK, this is someone who dresses like me and I relate to.' I didn't have that growing up, so to give that opportunity to a younger generation of women - and not just Somali women, but anyone who feels different - that means a lot to me.","It's always been hard trying to find the right pieces that go together, but it's always been something that interests me - finding new ways to be fashionable and cute but still being modest.","You don't have to show a lot of skin to be beautiful.","I truly believe diversity is beauty.","I am proud of being a Somali-American Muslim, and my wardrobe has been an important part of my religious and cultural upbringing.","Moving to the U.S. was an adjustment. I noticed that the kids played in groups. Back in Kakuma, everyone played together.","What I do is I always try to educate myself about my neighbors, about the people I meet.","We all have different things that make us strong and weak, but if we communicate and we really open ourselves and open our hearts, you're going to be amazed by the things that you can learn.","America has always been a land of diversity, basically made up of immigrants, and that is something I want to see continued. It's something I'm proud of when people think of America.","I know that for me, a lot of people will look at me and they'll think 'Somali' or 'outsider' instead of 'Minnesota.'","To be honest, before I joined the industry, I knew very little about the fashion world, and I hardly knew any name brands. Probably because the price tags were a little too high, and home girl needed to work.","I like shopping at retail places like JC Penney or Macy's, and maybe buying a top or a shirt, and then buying a skirt from Rue 21 or Forever 21 because they have the maxi skirts, which I appreciate so much, and then topping it off with something that I buy from a Somali shop.","I love speaking at schools. That's always my favorite because I wish I'd had someone who was like me come speak at my school.","Back in high school, I didn't ever see a Muslim homecoming king or queen - there was never even anyone nominated. It just seemed for a lot of those events, Muslim kids were not being included, and it was probably our fault too - no one was going for it, but no one was trying to push us to do it, you know?","I think to be Miss U.S.A., first of all, you need to represent everybody, all of us here.","The fashion industry really welcomed me with open arms and open hearts. They've been very accepting of my faith. I have strict wardrobe requirements, and that's something they've upheld.","I think it's important to be diverse, and I hope we continue to see that as a trend in the fashion industry.","Shopping for hijabs has always been fun for me. I was so excited to begin wearing a headscarf. I had always looked up to my mother as she wore hers, and I was eager to emulate her beauty and the wonderful things she represented.","I feel best when I am modestly dressed. It's a choice I make and am proud of; for me, I don't think I have to show skin to be beautiful.","There is a misconception that young Muslim women are oppressed. That simply isn't the case. I choose to dress modestly and choose to cover my hair with a hijab; not all Muslim women make that choice, and that's okay. We are all different!","Having the chance to walk at New York Fashion Week for Yeezy and Milan Fashion Week for Alberta Ferretti and Max Mara in a hijab is so significant. It sends a message to young women everywhere that you can be beautiful for just being you.","I never grew up seeing women that looked like me in magazines or on TV and didn't feel like I had a place in the world of fashion. I am honoured to be part of that change.","I sleep with aloe vera on - it's super moisturizing and good for the skin - and I'll switch that up with honey, which I leave on for 10 minutes then wash off.","I thought for a very long time that I had to conform or maybe change the way I look, or maybe the hijab was dimming my beauty. I took a moment, and then I realized, you know what, there's a lot of girls who do wear this, and this is their reality. It just made me even more prouder to wear it.","I think often the West does not understand the history and the privilege of wearing a hijab. They always think of oppression.","I remember, when I lived in a refugee camp, it was the people who weren't Somali, the people who came from Western countries, who helped the most. I remember being six and thinking, 'I want to be one of those women,' because I knew how much they helped us.","I know I got to do something that's one in a million, to escape a refugee camp, to come to this country and have so many doors open for me. So I want to go back and make a difference and give motivation or hope to all the kids that never got to leave or have the privilege that I did.","When you're a kid, to be honest, you could be in the worst situation ever, but you're still going to have ways to enjoy it.","It's important to remember all the millions of people that are starving.","There is not one description of beauty - that in fact it has different faces, different stories, and different background, and it's important to embrace all of those.","When I was younger, I got bullied for wearing my hijab.","I'm covered up, but I'm still getting these comments that say I shouldn't be. But the girls who wear the bikinis, they're being told they're too revealing! Enough. It's their body, their choice.","I will stand up for a girl who is being harassed or bullied for choosing to wear revealing clothes. I will stand up for that!","Wearing modest clothing is a belief, and I'm not going to say that every Muslim woman is in my shoes, but the majority of us do have a choice.","How boring would this world be if everyone was the same?","I don't just want to support only Muslim women. I want to inspire women across the board, and I'm hoping they won't allow things to get in the way.","I want to show people there's not just one way of being Muslim.","I want everyone to live to their full potential without having to fear someone will try to knock them down or discriminate against them.","I mix things from my Somali culture and my American side."],"Hall Caine":["That cry of the soul to be lifted out of the bondage of the narrow circle of life, which carries up to God the protest and yearning of suffering man, never finds a more sublime expression than where humanity is oppressed and religion is corrupt.","Out of the depths, O Lord, out of the depths,' begins the most beautiful of the services of our church, and it is out of the depths of my life that I must bring the incidents of this story."],"Halldor Laxness":["I feel a physical happiness when spring is coming.","I spent my entire childhood in an environment in which the mighty of the earth had no place outside story books and dreams.","Some things in literature are inexplicable.","It is a matter of simple fact that Icelanders have always been notoriously indolent.","The world is a song, but we do not know whether it is a good song because we have nothing to compare it with.","Love of, and respect for, the humble routine of everyday life and its creatures was the only moral commandment which carried conviction when I was a child.","My thoughts fly to the old Icelandic storytellers who created our classics, whose personalities were so bound up with the masses that their names, unlike their lives' work, have not been preserved for posterity.","From the very first, my countrymen have followed my literary career, now criticizing, now praising my work, but hardly ever letting a single word be buried in indifference."],"Halle Berry":["I'm not done with love, but I refuse to settle. I am a hopeless romantic. And I won't stop till I get it right.","I spent a lot of time with a crown on my head.","The man for me is the cherry on the pie. But I'm the pie and my pie is good all by itself. Even if I don't have a cherry.","I won't have a traditional marriage; I don't find the value in that anymore. But I am such a hopeless romantic and I really want love and I want a committed relationship, so I am going to reinvent marriage for myself.","Don't take yourself too seriously. Know when to laugh at yourself, and find a way to laugh at obstacles that inevitably present themselves.","I think it's always best to be who you are.","Having a baby takes so much from you. It's the most glorious thing you'll ever do, but the aftermath is not so glorious!","I think I am at my best when my hair is short. It's easier to take care of and more of who I am. Women are conditioned to think we need long hair.","I never wanted to be a model. My modelling career was nothing but a stepping stone to my acting career and that's all I ever saw it as. A pointless rock in the river that has to be stepped on in order to get to the meaningful oasis of acting.","I'd like to be able to use Storm's powers for good, like have it rain more in Southern California. We could do with it.","I see women in their 30s getting plastic surgery, pulling this up and tucking that back. It's like a slippery slope - once you start you pull one thing one way and then you think, 'Oh my God, I've got to do the other side.'","I'm just going to live my life and be who I am.","If you set out to do something and you give it your all and it doesn't work out, be willing to modify your goal slightly. Have the ability to look in another direction. A small shift could guide you to the real purposes of your life.","I don't see a white woman. I see a black woman, even though my mother is white. Knowing that has made my life easier, I think.","I'm done with men... I'm going to be alone. I have no luck with relationships. I don't think I'm made for marriage.","I think there's a certain level of trust that I have with women. I've always been honest, even when I haven't had good times in my life or my movie bombed or I've had great success. I've owned up to all of it.","When I was a kid, my mother told me that if you could not be a good loser, then there's no way you could be a good winner.","In a perfect world, I would be a painter. I love working with my hands. I don't get to do it as much as I like, but I am finding a way to make more time as life goes on because it's a really great outlet for me to express myself.","Let me tell you something - being thought of as a beautiful woman has spared me nothing in life. No heartache, no trouble. Love has been difficult. Beauty is essentially meaningless and it is always transitory.","The first step is clearly defining what it is you're after, because without knowing that, you'll never get it.","You think you know what love is - until you have a child and discover that unconditional mother love.","I do not love to work out, but if I stick to exercising every day and put the right things in my mouth, then my diabetes just stays in check.","I always had to prove myself through my actions. Be a cheerleader. Be class president. Be the editor of the newspaper.","I always had to diet. I'm diabetic, so it's a lifestyle for me anyway just to stay healthy and not end up in the hospital.","What's the worst that can happen? If it doesn't do well I can put on my big girl panties, deal with it and move on.","I like Doritos. I'm usually watching 'The Biggest Loser' eating Doritos.","There have been so many people who have said to me, 'You can't do that,' but I've had an innate belief that they were wrong. Be unwavering and relentless in your approach.","If you're of multiple races, you have a different challenge, a unique challenge of embracing all of who you are but still finding a way to identify yourself and I think that's often hard for us to do.","People win Oscars, and then it seems like they fall off the planet. And that's partly because a huge expectation walks in the room and sits right down on top of your head. The moment I won the Oscar, I felt the teardown the very next day.","I know I'm only one human being and I'm only making one tiny contribution and it's nothing more than that.","The times may have changed, but the people are still the same. We're still looking for love, and that will always be our struggle as human beings.","I'll never get married again, and I always hate to say never to anything, but I will never marry again.","A person's self-esteem has nothing to do with how she looks.","When I think, where did I laugh the most, where did I eat the most, where did I just feel good all the time, I would say making the Bond movie 'Die Another Day.' To be part of such an iconic franchise and to travel to exotic places - that was the most fun I ever had.","I know that I will never find my father in any other man who comes into my life, because it is a void in my life that can only be filled by him.","In the X-Men the women are so strong and sexy! We really kick some male butt!","You have to get the audience invested even if you're doing something that they think is dumb, it's kind of what these movies are all about.","There's a place in me that can really relate to being the underdog.","My whole life I've had the fear that I was going to be abandoned.","If you really want to be competitive in today's market you have to be in movies that make money.","I'm not sad at all about turning 40.","I'm not afraid of portraying anything on-screen.","I'm learning to accept the lack of privacy as the real downer in my profession.","I think a smart person today realizes that you have to be part of the art films that are done just for the sake of the art.","I don't know why, but I respond well to tortured characters.","Beauty is not just physical.","Anytime you put a movie out it's subject to such scrutiny and such criticism.","And you also have to do movies that are about commerce because that's what is required of the industry today.","After all, everybody has secrets and there are some things that nobody knows about you but only you, right?","I wish all men were like dogs.","The worst thing a man can ever do is kiss me on the first date.","While being called beautiful is extremely flattering, I would much rather be noticed for my work as an actress.","It is very hard to separate one's self from a character. Sometimes the people closest to me have to be very understanding.","I was black growing up in an all-white neighborhood, so I felt like I just didn't fit in. Like I wasn't as good as everybody else, or as smart, or whatever.","I guess you could say I have bad taste in men. But I no longer feel the need to be someone's wife.","I think I've evolved into someone pretty confident - in myself and in my skin.","I carried my Oscar to bed with me. My first and only three-way happened that night.","I'm a much better mother at 46... than if I were like, 21 or 25.","Self-esteem comes from who you have in your life. How you were raised. What you struggled with as a child.","By the time I left school, I had a lot of tenacity.","My mother helped me identify myself the way the world would identify me. Bloodlines didn't matter as much as how I would be perceived.","I'm not the girl for superhigh fashion because I don't have the right body.","I think we have become obsessed with beauty and personally I'm really saddened by the way women mutilate their faces today in search of that.","I'm not done with love, but I refuse to settle.","I am a hopeless romantic. And I won't stop till I get it right.","I don't think I'm unlike a lot of people. I am just someone who is trying to find that mate, and I think it's a really hard thing to do.","People win 'Oscars', and then it seems like they fall off the planet. And that's partly because a huge expectation walks in the room and sits right down on top of your head.","Every story about me is so heavy and dramatic. That's not how I do life. But that's the impression people have, and that's what keeps getting reiterated. As if I'm still stuck in all the muck of the past. And I am so not.","Career is important, but nothing really supersedes my roles as a mother.","Being a mother is probably the most important thing in my life right now.","Blackness is a state of mind, and I identify with the black community. Mainly, because I realized, early on, when I walk into a room, people see a black woman, they don't see a white woman. So out of that reason alone, I identify more with the black community.","I'm not the girl for super high fashion because I don't have the right body. When I want to get dressed up, I'm a Roberto Cavalli girl.","I'm not one of these actresses like, 'Okay, where's the camera? Is it here? Is it here?' I don't even ask the questions because I don't really want to know. I like not performing for a camera but giving it my best every single time whether you're close or whether you're far.","Being biracial is sort of like being in a secret society. Most people I know of that mix have a real ability to be in a room with anyone, black or white.","What's hardest for me to swallow is when there is a love story, say, with a really high-profile male star and there's no reason I can't play the part. They say, 'Oh, we love Halle, we just don't want to go black with this part.'","Throughout my career I have been talked out of things I wanted to do, and when I look back, I think I should have followed my instincts.","My style has evolved in a nice way, but everyone has bad moments.","I archive a lot of my clothes and have them wrapped up and in boxes. I call them 'little tombs' and keep them in a storage space... I would never get rid of the dress I wore on the night I won my Oscar. When I die, someone can have it, but not a minute before!","I'm not a fanatic about exercising. For me, it's about moderation and balance."],"Hallgrimur Helgason":["In the Nordic countries, there are hardly any societal problems, but we writers are bloodthirsty people like anyone else, so we have to quench this thirst with literature. If you live in a mafia state with lots of violence on the streets, you tend to write beautiful poetry.","Most early Icelandic paintings are landscapes.","I want the government to resign and an emergency government to be proclaimed, preferably made up of women. They can't do worse than men.","Thanks to the Jolabokaflod, books still matter in Iceland; they get read and talked about. Excitement fills the air. Every reading is crowded; every print run is sold.","Being a writer in Iceland, you get rewarded all the time: People really do read our books, and they have opinions; they love them, or they hate them. At the average Christmas party, people push politics and the Kardashians aside and discuss literature.","In Iceland, book lives matter in every sense of that phrase: The shelf-life of the book, the lives in the book, the life of the writer, and the life of the reader.","Everything is very expensive in Iceland, so I got some things done in India in the two months I was here. I visited the dentist, the optician, the tailor. When I go home, I'll have a new smile, a new wardrobe, and spectacles.","I'm trying to write about serious issues, about Iceland's journey into modernity, about the soul of Iceland - on how people react when they get too much money too quickly and how it affects our culture.","Iceland is a rich country, but in the early 21st century, this prosperity got to our heads, and in 2008, it collapsed.","My three years in Manhattan were sort of my university years. I was learning by myself, and it was a tough time. That's when I began writing articles for newspapers back home about life in New York. This interest took over, and I moved from painting to writing.","We have to save ourselves from ourselves. We have to minimize the effect our own politicians can have on our society. We have to get some rules from the outside.","For us Icelanders, the Sagas are like the Bible, only much better.","Like many writers, I'm usually more interested in reading about authors than their actual works. We're more curious to know how they were written than what they are like to read.","I'm the kind of writer who thinks style is just as important as the story being told.","Nabokov can be almost too delicate at times, but in 'Lolita,' he puts his aristocratic sensitivity to use in such a dark tale that it creates this great tension between the story being told and the style that it's written in. And it's just amazing that one of the best novels in English was written by a Russian.","As a writer, you have to be mean and vicious. Use the pen as your gun. Sometimes the people you write about get hurt.","You can't write my types of books without hurting someone.","Writing in English made me become a foreigner in my own country. It helped me create the necessary distance to my homeland."],"Hallie Ephron":["Everyone thinks when they start writing that they can't do it. I was lucky. My sister Delia was the most important person in terms of encouraging me.","Even though I got a late start, first publishing an essay when I was 50 years old, I've since written eight suspense novels.","Phoebe Wolkind Ephron cracked wise like Dorothy Parker and looked like Katharine Hepburn.","As we got older, we grew comfortable in roles that met our parents' expectations. Nora was the smart one. Delia, the comedian. I was the pretty, obedient one. And Amy was the adventurous mischief-maker.","The book that made a lasting impression was the one my mother gave each of us when she decided we were ready for our first 'adult novel,' Lucy Maud Montgomery's 'The Blue Castle.'","I don't think anybody in my family meant there to be any pressure for me to write. But our parents were incredibly verbal and wrote for a living. The house was full of books, and we all grew up steeped in language. I mean, our mother recited poetry at the dinner table.","My rule of writing is that no one can do what you can do, so jealousy or competitiveness are pointless. I am always happy when one of my sisters has a book published that I get to read.","I'm someone who sits at a computer eight hours a day, and I look in that pinhole camera at the top of my screen and think, 'Someone could be watching me.'","Outlining is like putting on training wheels. It gives me the courage to write, but we always go off the outline.","A man notices a woman's figure when she walks in a room. Women have eight million words for blue; a man says dark blue or light blue.","I'm sharpest early, and though I can rewrite any time, day or night, I'm useless after noon when it comes to writing first draft.","I haven't given any thought to collaborating with my sisters. It would be great fun. My daughter Molly is a wonderful writer - someday I'd love to collaborate with her.","Our house was awash in books, and my mother doled out her favorites like they were special treats - which they were.","For me, a good YA novel is the best kind of comfort food.","I'd long wanted to write about that moment when a woman steps off the career track to have her first child. For me, that was a scary time.","When you put your characters in a dire situation, they often do things that surprise even you, so you have to go back and revise your original conception of who they are.","When something happens far back in the past, people often can't recall exact details. Blame depends upon point of view. There may be a villain, but reality is frustrating because it's often ambiguous.","I was an outsider, never quite part of what was going on, always looking in. It turned out to be great preparation for writing fiction."],"Halsey":["I wear my personality on my sleeve, for sure, and my look is constantly changing because so am I.","If I am who I am, I'm provocative, candid, and androgynous; there's nothing I can do that will make any fan think, 'I didn't expect that from her.'","The environment around you shapes who you are. How you handle an emergency or how you react when someone is rude to you, that's you.","My mom is awesome. She's really young. My mom is 40, and she raised me listening to Nirvana and Courtney Love and Coldplay, Gin Blossoms, The Cranberries, and stuff. Like, my early, early memories are of being a little kid running around in floral skirts and Doc Martens when I was, like, three.","You can be accessible without catering to an audience.","So many people are concerned with being the perfect 'something.' Whether it's the perfect singer, the perfect sexy girl, or the perfect feminist. I don't want to be the perfect anything.","People are so afraid to talk about real things, but they're experiences that everyone goes through.","I like writing about places, about people and environments. When I create a world, it lets me go in and define the details of that world.","Even if you can't relate to what I'm singing, I hope you can believe in it and see it as something that it is real.","If I go out there and am myself, and I do what makes me comfortable and what I think is true to my artistry, and they don't like it, then that's fine. I walk off stage, and I know there's nothing there's nothing I could have done differently.","Being bisexual, being bipolar, being biracial - it's been used to define me, but I am desperate to be indefinable.","I'm a human, and I'm multidimensional. If I was the perfect form of anything, I'd be boring. If I was a free spirit all the time, I would be boring; I would lack depth. If I was dark and enigmatic all the time, then I would lack relatability.","I'm not going to present myself one way all the time just because it will make me sell best.","In one week, I went from being a girl who owed a guy thousands of dollars - my manager Anthony was paying for my outfits, paying for my food; I was sleeping in his parents' basement - to taking meetings with every major label in America. The next morning, I had a record deal and wrote him a cheque to pay back all that money.","A guitar can be so human, so sorrowful, so angry, and I wanted to figure out how to achieve that vibe without having to actually use guitars, because 'Badlands' is a very futuristic record - and making it that in an era of futuristic music is a really hard thing to do!","I didn't even realize I was writing songs - I thought I was just being witty and sarcastic.","People around me like me the best when I'm depressed because I'm a bit more passive.","You can tell if there's magic in something. When you start it, you want to finish it and you want it to be perfect. If you're not inspired, and you're working hard to pull inspiration from somewhere and make a song something it's not, then it's very contrived, and I don't like to write music that's contrived.","The cool thing about my show and me is that I'm a writer, and I'm a writer first if I don't have music.","I end up pleading my case to alternative programmers - you're telling me that my music is too dark for pop, too pop for alternative, and urban radio won't touch it - so we have a record that doesn't fit in. And what is more alternative than that?","It's hard because I think I fall into this in-between space where there's something that's innately feminine about me, and there's also something that's kind of androgynous. I carry myself somewhere in between, and I think my music lends itself to that as well.","I'm open about having bipolar disorder. I'm open about being of mixed race. I'm open about being bisexual, and I have this wantingness to talk about it, and for me, it's about more than being a role model for any specific community.","I don't want to be 'Halsey: America's Sweetheart,' or 'Halsey: Bad Girl.' If you can sum up my career in a clickbait headline, I've done something wrong.","When I was in high school, I was a bad kid and a good student.","Most artists, their 60th show was in front of no one. My first show was in front of 1,200 people.","I wouldn't trivialize my existence into a hashtag.","I want any kid who listens to my music to see that I am confident with all elements of my personality that I can't change.","I was a weirdo. I think I wanted to be liked, but I didn't have the attention or bother to actually make an effort to be. I also think I had a different perception of what I needed to do to be liked.","Please don't erase my race because I'm white-passing. There is literally nothing I can do about my complexion.","I think escapism is something artists write about pretty frequently - it's something everyone can relate to, the concept of wanting something more, wanting to find solace, wanting to have something better.","All the musicians I loved growing up were men. I loved Leonard Cohen, Mick Jagger. I loved Alex Turner from the Arctic Monkeys. Even today, I love Van McCann from Catfish and the Bottlemen and Matt Healy from The 1975.","I think, growing up in a small town - I grew up in a lot of different places. I grew up in a city environment, a more suburban environment, a more rural environment. That's the beauty of New Jersey is you get a lot of different types of living.","When you're an artist, you're expected to describe yourself in interviews every day in five words.","I learned how quickly I could go from having never met someone to having the world think I'm dating them.","You can expect nothing in being a musician, and you have to be just very thankful every time it goes positively for you.","The 'Room 93' EP was just kind of picking apart the sense of voyeurism and the sense of isolation and turning it into, essentially, a little black book and reflecting on - at that time - 19 years of me forming relationships with people.","That's one thing the musicians don't remember: you don't choose your demographic - they choose you.","I love films that show people in a way that's so real it's almost unsettling, and that's what really inspires me because I write about people. I write about people that I know, so I want to portray them and portray myself in a way that is unapologetic.","Being a pop-leaning, female artist, you'd think that I'd have my record company breathing down my neck and trying to control everything I'm doing. Actually, they've just kind of let me take the wheel.","I had a crazy life for a teenager. I lived in New Jersey, but I'd go to Vermont for three weeks, join a commune, take pictures with the guy I was dating, come back home, and post photos.","When you're a teenage girl, a lot of being pretty has to do with your hair.","You don't know fear until it's 7 A.M. and freezing cold on live television, and you're not sure if Justin Bieber is going to kiss you or not.","As a songwriter, pop music really is a love and a joy and a science, and I feel like a lot of people look at pop music with a very formulaic perspective in numbers and patterns, but an outsider would think that the process is very natural.","I'm used to packing up and leaving, to condensing myself into a digestible version because people don't have much time to get to know me.","I'm a fixer, unfortunately. I'm like, 'Oh, I can fix you.' But it's not just guys I'm dating anymore. It's this entire legion of young girls who tell me they need me to maintain any sort of sanity or peace.","I have to remember for every kid saying something awful, there's a kid saying something great.","I write songs very quickly, so the 20 minutes of joy I get out of writing a song doesn't compare to the two months of joy I get engaging with the people who like my music.","It usually takes me 20 to 90 minutes to write a song because once I start, I don't stop. If I start writing a song, and you try to have a conversation with me, you're a bad person.","I'm not actually even a very good singer. I'm not.","I'm 21 years old, and it's kind of uncomfortable for me to talk about, but I'm in the 1 percent as far as my income and tax bracket. But now that I'm here, there's no amount of money you can wave in front of my face that will make me understand depriving people of human rights.","I hate feeling like a prisoner. I show up somewhere, and I can't explore the city because there's, like, 6,000 to 10,000 people on the lookout for me.","Every song I write is autobiographical and is about people, and that's one of the things that gets complicated. You have to decide where's your place as a songwriter.","The idea of 'Badlands' was creating a space with sound, which is a really difficult thing to do.","My EP, 'Room 93,' was all about isolation - it was based on the idea of being in a hotel room and being totally alone with yourself or that other person.","You numb yourself so you're not terrified when you're on TV at 7 o'clock in the morning with Justin Bieber, who you just met a couple of days before, having to perform in front of millions of people.","At the end of the day, every decision I make about my music is about creating a collective.","Every time I got to play a show, even if it's already sold out, I'm so scared no one's going to come.","I love pop music, but at the same time, I'm seeking to write whatever I'm organically inclined to.","For me, writing about hotels is like writing about being in a parallel universe. The sense of voyeurism, and the sense of removedness, and there are all these people silently above you and next to you.","I'm learning slowly to not be as much of a control freak. I can't afford to be all the time, but I'm getting better at communicating. Delegating parts of my vision for other people to execute has made it an easier process for knowing what I want, and what people can handle, and what I should probably save for myself.","I feel like, if I'm going to have young, impressionable people listening to my music, then I'm going to respect that.","Every 16-year-old person has a love for pop in them because pop is popular.","'Badlands' is a very tangible record; a lot of the sounds were actual things: they were pots and pans, and they were rocks, and they were voices,and instruments used in a way to create a landscape of sound.","In 2016, makeup has become an incredible passion and hobby for men and women, but it hasn't become mainstream.","The hardest thing about writing my second album is that I had 20 years to write my first album.","I consider myself someone who takes a lot of beauty risks, and I've realized what I liar I am. I change my hair a lot, from blue to blonde to bald, but I'm trying to branch out a little more with makeup.","Being a musician, people ask you a lot about what musicians inspire you, and there's plenty of musicians that I love and respect, but I think that I'm the most inspired by cinema.","I love Quentin Tarantino; I love Harmony Korine, Larry Clarke.","I would love to write a screenplay for 'Badlands' one day. I don't think I could ever have the patience to do it; I don't even have the patience to write songs. I write some of the shortest songs ever because I don't have the patience.","It's really exciting to see all those people that exist in numbers online translate into tickets and then into faces, handshakes, pictures, stories.","I want to be treated like a musician.","My first album was called 'Badlands,' and it's something that I think I'm most proud of having done in my life.","I cultivated this fan base that I really didn't really understand or appreciate until I put my first headlining tour up for sale. 500- to 1,000-capacity rooms weren't an underplay for me at the time. I'd never done a tour before!","I put so much of myself out there and make myself so accessible that sometimes I fear I make myself too accessible.","I have this first album that sells more than 100,000 copies in its first week, debuts at number two, goes gold, the single goes platinum, we're doing Madison Square Garden.","I'm a musician with a very unique mental state, I suppose. I'm agoraphobic. I'm scared to leave my house. I haven't been alone in, like, two years. I'm either with my boyfriend or my assistant, my manager or my tour manager. I won't go anywhere by myself; I'm too terrified.","Whether it's writing songs, being on stage, being interviewed, meeting fans - I just try to be myself, which is kind of exhausting because it almost feels like it never shuts off.","I was doing some YouTube covers, and I had a decently popular blog on Tumblr.","My mom has every issue of 'Billboard' I've ever been in.","I was obsessed with learning about social behaviors. I remember explaining to my mom that kids on my soccer team were fighting because of dyads and triads.","I love Kanye West. I think he's a visionary. He's one of those people for whom I separate his personality from his artistry.","Everything that I hate about myself goes away when I was onstage.","There are conspiracy theorists who think I was crafted in a boardroom. Because I'm so very relatable and so very topical and so very Tumblr.","I was a fan of One Direction when I was 16, but I was also a fan of Bring Me The Horizon and hardcore bands.","I used to work at a punk venue in Pennsylvania because I wanted to be near music.","I put 'Ghost' online hoping to make a couple hundred bucks, but then the next day, I took meetings with five different record companies.","To be fair, I did come out of nowhere. 'Ghost' was the first song I ever did in a studio, my first time ever cutting a professional vocal.","I made up 'Badlands'; anything I say, goes. I came to realize I was materializing a metaphor for my mental state.","In a city, there's more room to be, where in a small town, you have to squish yourself down a little bit. And it's exciting for me to be pursuing a career where I don't have to be small.","I was always running off to the city, whether it was Philly or New York, going somewhere where there was something more for me.","Growing up in the suburbs, I used to listen to punk rock, Brand New, Taking Back Sunday. And no one from my high school listened to it."],"Halston Sage":["My favorite weekend activity is riding bikes to breakfast.","I went to an all-girls school, and I always felt like I missed out on a traditional high-school life.","I love dogs. I have a Golden Doodle and an Alaskan Klee Kai.","Things I say are sometimes silly.","My dad is afraid of my laugh.","Making a movie is like an accelerated version of growing up with someone. You spend so many hours a day with each other, and you're putting your heart into this same effort.","I always start the day by washing my face and moisturizing.","I like the simplicity of a halter-top or plunging neckline, but I'll rough it up by wearing studded shoes and my leather jacket.","I like to Instagram my dogs! I also get excited to post behind-the-scenes photos from when I was filming something.","'Girl, Interrupted' is one of my favorite movies.","I'm 20 years old, and I still love love. I hope I'm sweet. Just your everyday girl.","I did grow up reading the 'Twilight' books. I feel guilty, but I was always Team Edward.","The whole experience on 'Grown Ups 2' was like going to adult summer camp.","I did grow up in Los Angeles. I actually didn't start acting until I was sixteen, so I was very removed from the Hollywood scene. I had always been in my school plays, but my mom and dad wanted to keep me out of the business until I was old enough to know who I was and not let anyone change me.","I am excited when I get a movie and I get to move somewhere for a certain amount of time. But I am a Cali girl.","I went to high school in Los Angeles, and I grew up riding horses, so that was kind of my life. I always wanted to act.","I met my agent when I was 10 years old on a family skiing vacation. He asked if I was interested in acting, and I had been doing school plays. A couple of years later, I called him up, and I started auditioning.","I would love to be in a Nicholas Sparks movie. And Scarlett Johansson inspired me. I think it's cool when women are able to kick butt.","I grew up riding horses since I was eight. I rode English style and competed every weekend. I had two horses, Scout and Camille, and they were my babies. It taught me a lot about responsibility and commitment. I hope horses will always be in my life.","John Mayer and Jack Johnson are two of my all-time favorites. I love Colbie Caillat and really cool, beach-y, guitar, acoustic type music.","I love oatmeal raisin cookies.","New York City is my favorite city in the world.","I'm not always happy, I promise. I can be serious."],"Halston":["You are only as good as the people you dress.","Buzz and the right publicist are not only important but crucial in show business."],"Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa":["May Allah guide us to the good of the kingdom of Bahrain and its loyal people.","Democracy is not just constitutional and legislative rules; it is a culture and practice and adhering by the law and respecting international human rights principles.","Any government that has a sincere desire for reform and progress should understand the benefit of objective and constructive criticism.","I care about Bahrain. Bahrain is very dear to me. I will not allow people to play around with our laws.","I cherished the dream of a country embracing all its people.","Bahrain 's margin of freedom is growing day after day as we head into the future with steady steps.","Bahrain lies at the epicenter of Gulf security and any violent upheaval in Bahrain would have enormous geopolitical consequences. Global economic stability depends on the uninterrupted export of crude oil from the Gulf to markets around the world - a job that historically has been assigned to the U.S. Fifth Fleet.","By being friends with all, we are not alone.","History shows that no enemy remains hostile forever, nor do friends remain friendly forever. For that reason, we intend to have normal relations with all.","The decision to open up Bahrain to embrace all people indiscriminately was fostered in me ever since I was a child.","The reform process began with the historic consensus on the Charter of National Action, in which the Bahraini people decided on a new chapter of their history.","Reform is the mission from which we shall not digress; it is an expression of belief and determination between us and our people. With the help of Allah, we will proceed forward in this promising national process within the natural progress of the life cycle and the development of people and nation.","Sectarian divide has created a schism in our society that is a major challenge. As monarch of all Bahrainis, it pains me to see many harmed by the actions of a few. And yet I am optimistic and have faith in our people. We all realize that now is the time to strike a balance between stability and gradual reform.","We invite American companies looking to raise capital to list on the Bahrain Stock Exchange. The region has a liquidity oversupply approximating $1 trillion and this pool of capital can be tapped into by creative American companies. The next Facebook may very well get funded on the BSE.","In establishing democracy, we have to be sensitive to the regional and national context. Democracy also means to guarantee the rights of the minorities. That's my job as a king. We have for example a Jewish ambassador in the US and a Christian in the UK.","Bahrainis are better off than many other Arabs. We have a welfare state, everybody gets a salary whether they have a job or not. Electricity and food are subsidized; school and healthcare are free. And we don't differentiate between Bahrainis and foreigners. We are very proud of that.","If somebody gives me his hand, I will not look at him with suspicion.","If you like your brother and he's prospering, you'll be pleased for him.","It's good to have a leader, otherwise we argue too much.","Our people have proven their desire for continuing with reforms. We complete the march today with those who have an honest patriotic desire for more progress and reform.","The Bahraini people are eager to obtain facts to enable them to shape a comprehensive national opinion without division among its people. We confirm to all journalists and media personnel in the kingdom of Bahrain that their freedom is preserved and their rights are safeguarded.","Along with our friends in the GCC, the first order of business is stability. Beyond the imperative of stability, the most important priority is job creation for all Bahrainis.","We have evidence that a number of Bahrainis who oppose our government are being trained in Syria. I have seen the files and we have notified the Syrian authorities, but they deny any involvement.","There is no ethnic cleansing in Bahrain, no mass genocide, no policy of killing innocent people.","In a sense there is no 'opposition' in Bahrain, as the phrase implies one unified block with the same views. Such a phrase is not in our constitution, unlike say the United Kingdom. We only have people with different views and that's ok.","There is no doubt that some in Iran have an unhealthy focus on Bahrain, as some of the broadcast coverage shows.","We are a constitutional monarchy. I don't order laws, I propose them. Article 35 of our constitution states that the king can only refuse a law of parliament once, then he has to sign it - if the same law is then supported by a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament.","There are no 'political prisoners' as such in Bahrain. People are not arrested because they express their views, we only have criminals.","Societies cannot move forward without law, and our constitution is the cornerstone of the law and our National Assembly is its umbrella and fortress.","If people have done something wrong then they should be held accountable.","I care about Bahrain.","Bahrain is very dear to me.","I don't order laws, I propose them.","No king should rule absolutely, like a dictator.","You cannot transpose the U.S. system on Turkey, and the Turkish system on France etc. You have to understand the people and their culture. That's leadership."],"Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani":["I really don't want you to think of Qatar as a hydrocarbon country alone. We know that hydrocarbons will come and go. But education will stay. It is the most important thing for us.","It is better for the Arab countries themselves to interfere out of their national, humanitarian, political and military duties and to do what is necessary to stop the bloodshed in Syria.","I would like to extend to you our deep appreciation and thanks for the position the United States has taken in support of the democratization process that has taken place in Tunisia, in Egypt, and what is attempting to take place in Libya.","Based on 30 years of experience with the Iranians, they will give you 100 words. Trust only one of the 100.","Of course we are coming to invest in Germany - that is certain. Most airplanes in the fleet of Qatar Airways are from Airbus.","We in the Middle East like to talk politics, we like to argue. Just look at the three prophets - Moses, Jesus and Mohammad. They are all from this small region which creates problems all the time.","I don't see why OPEC countries should continue to cut production just to keep the price of oil high. This will not affect the industrial countries alone, it will also hit poor countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Who will look after them?"],"Hamadoun Toure":["You will not be able to meet the Millennium Development goals in health without e-health, in education without e-education, and government services will not be able to be provided without e-government services.","Broadband gives small businesses the opportunity to broaden their customer base and reduce their overheads through e-commerce platforms.","The right to communicate is a basic human right, and I believe that putting that on every national agenda is very important."],"Hamdi Ulukaya":["Just about anyone can make a good product, but it's the people that count. In the end, it's the employees who will take it from a kitchen-table idea to the next level. There are a lot of important things in business, but the people portion comes first.","Entrepreneurship is seen as if you're in Silicon Valley or New York City and starting an app business or a social-media business, which is cool. But what we really have to focus on is people who make things, and how can we fund them, and how can we encourage people to stay in their community and make a difference in their community.","Every small business will give you an entrepreneurial way of looking at things. I guarantee you that for every plant that closes, if you gave it to one small-business person in that community, he or she would find a way to make it work. The small-business attitude is you always find a way to make it work.","There are a lot of studies about small businesses and how they make a difference in their community and create a lot of jobs and values. So we need to focus on small businesses or entrepreneurs who want to start manufacturing or making things.","Growing up in eastern Turkey, I was not really involved with the family business - sheep and cow farming, yogurt and cheese making. But I think I learned from my father the unspoken business language or instincts that go back thousands of years.","Unlike the objective of far too many companies, manufacturing is not about a quick 'exit.' It is centered on long-term value creation.","I didn't have a business degree. I didn't have experience to work in somebody else's office. I never built or ran a department. So I was on this journey, and when the time came to make a decision, I was just going with my gut.","I brought in a yogurt master from Turkey. I went to Greece. I was always going back and forth, from New York to Turkey and Greece. The recipe we use has been around hundreds and hundreds of years. Growing up in Turkey, not a day would go by that we wouldn't eat yogurt like this.","You can find Chobani in every major supermarket, in club stores, convenience stores and airports. But we're not everywhere yet. We have been struggling with keeping up with demand.","What happened was I saw this ad for a yogurt plant for sale. It was in my junk mail pile, and I threw it into the garbage can. And then about half an hour later, with the dirt on it, I picked it up from the garbage can, and I called out of curiosity.","I was always told yogurt had to be sweet to appeal to Americans. But when people go to Turkey or Greece, within 15 minutes of their return, they start talking about how much they enjoyed the yogurt there.","A closed plant is like a cemetery; it really is. The walls will talk to you; the machines will talk to you if you really talk to them.","On the tech side, little start-ups can do something magnificent. They don't need too much in terms of plants and infrastructure.","I'm not somebody who is going to build something for a few years, sell it, and then go off and just have fun.","We took a plant that was being closed by a big company thinking there was no good use for it, and we came in with a different perspective. We bought some used equipment, as simple as we could.","Fage does not make great yogurt.","My mother used to make the most amazing yogurt.","For a startup, you need to stay small so the others don't attack, or you aim to be one of the big guys. If you don't do it right, you might lose everything.","I came to the U.S. in 1994 to learn English and go to business school, but I took only a few business courses at the State University of New York at Albany and didn't finish.","I started a feta cheese company, Euphrates, in upstate New York in 2002.","Everyone asks me why someone Turkish is making Greek yogurt. In Greece, it is not called 'Greek yogurt.' Everywhere in the world it is called 'strained yogurt.' But because it was introduced in this country by a Greek company, they called it 'Greek yogurt.'","Most Americans descend from the very people who built this country with their bare hands.","A manufacturing resurgence is what will give local communities and small towns across America a fighting chance for survival. Many of today's American entrepreneurs come from those very places but make their wealth elsewhere. We need to change that."],"Hamid Karzai":["Terrorism, ladies and gentlemen, in my eyes I have a very, very, very simple explanation. Gangs of criminals, killers, used unfortunately by certain governments in the past for political purposes, who are on their own now as gangs.","As the country now turns a new leaf, our ambition is to give hope to each and every Afghan.","We as the Afghan people and government are willing to help Pakistan work for peace in Afghanistan and work for peace in Pakistan, together.","The holy book is implanted in the hearts and minds of all the Muslims. Humiliation of the holy book represents the humiliation of our people.","Life without Liberty is far worse than death.","No foreigner has a place asking another people, another country, to change their constitution.","The war on terror, if this is a war on terror, can only be won by a sincere regional and international cooperation. All have to believe they have something at stake and work together. In the absence of this it will become political and interest-oriented.","But the war on terror as I have repeatedly said in the past, and the Afghan people believe in it, in truth, is that the war on terror is not in the Afghan villages or homes. Its in the sanctuaries, it is in the training grounds, its in the motivation factors and the money that comes to it.","Once the Afghan people vote and they choose their President with direct, secret ballot from all over the country, there will be a lot of difference in this country and a lot of legitimate power to flow with implementation.","I don't think Osama is a Muslim. I don't think Osama is a human being.","Terrorism as a force is gone. As individuals they are all around and we will continue to look for them.","Where liberty dies, evil grows.","The capture of Saddam Hussein has proven to the bad ones, to the guilty ones, to the sinful ones that they cannot run forever. Sooner or later, the other criminals will also be found from their hideouts.","Afghanistan is very satisfied with Croatia's participation in the NATO-led peace mission and expects Croatia to expand its contribution to peace restoration in Afghanistan to other areas as well.","The fight, this war, this fight against the remnants of terrorism will go on for some time.","They're criminals, they brutalized Afghanistan, they killed our people, they destroyed our land.","A democratically elected congressman of the United States of America should not be talking of an ethnic divide in Afghanistan, should not be interfering in Afghanistan's internal affairs.","People in Afghanistan want peace, including the Taliban. They're also people like we all are. They have families, they have relatives, they have children, they are suffering a tough time.","The majority of the Afghan people support a strategic partnership with the United States.","The worst thing for an effective war on terror is the suspicion of states about the objectives.","If the United States is treating Afghanistan as a sovereign country it has to prove it.","As the president of Afghanistan I look at the suffering of our people as a whole.","I don't think the Taliban will ever come back to take Afghanistan, no.","Afghanistan is a country in need. Afghanistan needs to protect itself in the region; Afghanistan needs to secure itself within the country. Afghanistan needs to develop its forces, and Afghanistan needs to provide stability to the people.","I never call it an insurgency. I call it terrorism.","If it is terrorism, if it is war on terror, then the Afghan people will join you on terror.","I would never call a neighbor an enemy. But I would request the neighbor to be a good neighbor, to see that the neighbor's interest is a stable prosperous neighbor, a neighbor that is doing well.","We are not America. We are Afghanistan.","Afghanistan has moved forward and Afghanistan will defend itself. And the progress that we have achieved, the Afghan people will not allow it to be put back or reversed.","The West has been able to bring Afghanistan a much better health service, better education, better roads, a better economy, though some have benefited more; some have benefited less from that economic well-being in Afghanistan."],"Hamilton E. James":["I went to Harvard College and determined right away when I was a junior that I was unemployable, since I think I applied to 300 jobs and didn't get any of them, so I decided that I would stay in school and go to Harvard Business school, and that's my background.","My advice to young people is to get something that's growing because that's how you get career opportunities thrown at you that you don't deserve, if you will... that come at you early because the firms need you."],"Hamilton Jordan":["I went to my son's graduation this weekend, and I heard a great quote I've never heard before from Albert Einstein. It was that the greatest danger to the world is not the bad people but it's the good people who don't speak out.","When you have a diagnosis of cancer, or any serious illness, your choices are basically to be passive and kind of accept whatever is offered you, or to be active and to learn about your disease, and understand your options, and be an active partner with your doctor. That's the course I took with all three of my cancers.","If you had found the right candidate in 2000 or 2004, and you could have put that man or woman, given them ballot access in September of the election year, they could have won the election.","The difference today is that, in both parties, the very extreme elements control the nomination process.","I used to worry about what would happen five or 10 years from now, but I don't anymore. I thought about going to medical school because that has always interested me, but decided against it.","I was in Vietnam, and I was exposed to Agent Orange. And there's a high relationship between people that were exposed to Agent Orange and the kind of lymphoma that I had. The prostate cancer was genetic in my family. My father had prostate cancer, my - three of my four uncles had prostate cancer.","We're trying to build a platform utilizing the Internet that allows the good American people to speak out about their frustration about the polarized country that we live in politically.","You mentioned Ross Perot. Mr. Perot jumped into the race at the last minute, had one issue that he ran on, the budget deficit, was in and out of the race a couple of times, and still got 20 million votes, didn't have the Internet.","We have the American people properly concerned about the future of our country and the world.","And when you start talking about the practicality of winning a race like that - you've got to remember we're not talking about winning 51 percent of the vote. We're talking about winning 36, 37, 38 percent of the vote.","And a tiny number of people in a few states make these decisions, and we're left with these options that are increasingly not attractive to the American people.","If you think the system - not you - but if your viewers think that the current political system is working well and serving the interest of our country, then what we're doing will not be attractive.","I think the system is broken; most people think that it's broken. And we think that what we're going to do is invigorate the political system and allow for this country to be turned around.","I like Kahlua and ice cream as a dessert.","I didn't work for Jimmy Carter all those years to go to cocktail parties. I was there as a political adviser, a short-order cook, to work on topical matters.","I know a lot of people that had one cancer that are not alive today. I've had three. So my glass is much more than half full.","If your doctor tells you you have a rare disease that he or she has never seen, if you've got an incurable cancer, boy, don't accept that. You know, go and get a second opinion.","I've never been a Clinton fan. He's had some accomplishments, and he's very skilled at politics, but, you know, he's had some successes and a very good economy. And the question is how much or how little of that does he deserve credit for.","It's hard to look inside a person to answer a question about why anybody wants to be president. I suppose a combination of ambition, ego, and a real feeling that he could make a difference and could accomplish some things. All you ever had to do for Jimmy Carter was to tell him something was impossible, and he would usually do it.","My role in the White House was grossly exaggerated by the press. Fortunately for the American people, when the president had to make a critical economic decision or a decision on a weapons system, he did not turn to me and say, 'Hamilton, what in the hell do I do?'","To say that Jimmy Carter does not understand politics or is not a good politician denies the phenomenon by which he got to the White House. He is without question the best politician, when he's working at it, of anybody I have ever seen.","Sometimes at night, when I leave and ride by the front of the White House and the lights are on, it is so beautiful, I have some sense of, 'Hey, that's where I work, and Jimmy is President now.' But day in and day out, it's a job.","The battle in American politics used to be for the middle. Now, it's all about the building and the intensity of support on the far left and far right wings of both parties. And we have forgotten about the people here in the middle."],"Hamish Bowles":["I started collecting couture when I was about 10 or 11 years old, and the very first piece I bought was a Balenciaga suit from 1962.","When I think of my childhood, I see my mother, the complete sixties parent, decked in purple frappe silk caftans, the acidic smell of newly stripped pine mingling with incense.","As a boy soprano in the high school choir, I later sang a solo during the carol service at Canterbury Cathedral, but I was too young to secure the Freddy Eynsford-Hill role in our production of 'My Fair Lady' - and far too timid to have thought to audition for it.","When I was 14, I entered British Vogue's annual talent contest and got a special mention. I went up to London to meet the editors and wrote about it in my high school magazine.","I have Tom Ford, Gucci, Saint Laurent, McQueen, and odd pieces that I've just acquired because I happened to have come across them and felt they have some historical resonance.","This is how I started: My mom was crazy for antique shops and junk shops, and my sister and I would play this game where, if we were driving with my parents and saw a junk shop or an antique shop, we'd scream at the top of our lungs. My poor father would have heart failure and screech to a halt, and we'd leap out and go and explore.","Personally, of course it's exasperating when people think you're just swanning around in Europe, going to the occasional fashion show and then being glamorous at a party.","Marrakech in May is unseasonably tagine-hot.","My obsession with accumulation, which at times has taken on the whisper of a psychic illness - as anyone who has experienced the ode to the Collyer brothers that is my 'Vogue' office will concur - began in infancy.","I found myself at dusk in the bewitching Roman city of Jerash with H.M. Queen Rania of Jordan one year, and scrambling with hardened paparazzi to get an image of the Princess of Wales in a tiny Nepalese clinic in the foothills of the Himalayas another.","My childhood memories seem to be wreathed in the twin and far from harmonious olfactory sensations of patchouli oil and caustic soda.","The whole scale and scope of the decorating and fashion business in this country are incomparably grander than in London. What's thrilling about America in general, and the New York fashion scene in particular, is its optimism. It makes the whole experience energizing and uplifting.","I started looking at fashion magazines, specifically 'British Vogue.' I was reading a lot about Cecil Beaton. Then I thought maybe I should start collecting.","There are so many different criteria for my collecting, and I have to confess that the goalposts do shift. But obviously, with my background, I am particularly drawn to things that have been documented in contemporary magazines.","Occasionally, I will come across something that has lost its label over the years - maybe the client didn't want to declare the dress at customs and took the label out - but I'll recognize it from an image that I've seen in Vogue, or a little thumbnail sketch.","When I started in 1992, I really thought the 'Vogue' fashion department was one of the most frightening places on the planet.","I think there's much more fashion competition in the more junior levels of the fashion department. And that's exciting and stimulating to see, because it's 'Vogue;' it's great to see people dressed originally and with great style and panache. It wouldn't be 'Vogue' otherwise.","I was a fashion editor for years in London before I came to 'Vogue,' and I spent my life arranging the folds of a ball gown skirt for a picture and pinning fabric and using all those stylist tricks. And you don't have to do that now because they can do it in Photoshop.","I kind of miss the hatchet days of Mr. Fairchild at 'WWD', when they really took no prisoners and there was sort of outrageous favoritism and its inverse.","We're obviously in a strange environment where practically anyone can set themselves up as a pundit of sorts. It's all about sorting the wheat from the chaff, and I'm very interested in reading different points of view, and certainly different generations than my own that have such a very different world view.","Although I have lived in Manhattan since 1992, for the better part of two decades I have remained in blissful oblivion of all matters sportif.","In the midst of applying for American citizenship, of finally attempting to get my presidents in a row, I felt it incumbent upon myself to explore the national psyche in every way.","Actually, I had no idea what shooting hoops was or were. I thought dunking was something you did with a beignet and a cup of steaming coffee. I wasn't exactly sure what a Knick was.","For reasons that baffle me still, my high school sports coaches put me in the first division of the rugby, cricket, and soccer teams.","Singing for me has always been a joyous but private pleasure that connects me in a lyric thread to my beloved grandmother Alice.","I literally in the New York flea market - just when I was despairing of ever having a great serendipitous find - found a 1926 Chanel.","My interior is very, very dense - Proustian-looking, sort of Henry James. The walls are covered in pictures, and I transformed the big drawing room into a library lined with books.","I don't have an off-duty wardrobe.","Six feet three in her stocking feet, L'Wren Scott was every inch a great lady.","I was ten years old when my first 'Vogue' cover sang me its siren call and dashed me against the treacherous rocks of fashion obsession.","My tastes formed quite early. All I ever wanted to do was go to costume museums.","My mother is the sort of woman who not only can raise a chicken and roast it to moist perfection but, as she proved to my openmouthed sister and me on a family holiday to Morocco when we were very young, can barter for one in a market, kill it, pluck it, and then cook it to perfection.","In the face of postwar austerity, hundreds of brides-to-be across the country sent Princess Elizabeth their clothing coupons so that she could have the dress of their dreams.","Lady Diana Spencer looked to relatively unknown designers - David and Elizabeth Emanuel, recently graduated from the Royal College of Art - when she wed Prince Charles in 1981.","I have a confession to make. In the beginning, I did not understand the Kate Moss phenomenon.","What an electric thrill it sends up and down the spine, how it sets the heart racing: A Royal Romance! A Royal Wedding! The pomp and the pageantry!","In Miss Catherine Middleton we have the faintest, intoxicating glimmer of a New Age Cinderella story.","Possessions. The very word is potent - suggestive as it is of ownership both material and erotic. To possess. Possession. Possessed.","After student years of flat-sharing and living with other people's taste, I went into decorating overdrive when I acquired my first apartment - its floor plan not much bigger than the vintage Hermes scarves I then wore side-knotted on my head, pirate-style."],"Hamish Linklater":["You want to throw yourself in as many uncomfortable places as possible, if you want to build muscles in uncomfortable parts of your body and grow as an artist.","I'm a pretty cliche actor in that I hate watching myself on film.","I did try to go to college and try to be an English major.","It was an outdoor Shakespeare theater that I grew up at. That feels like home, and the place I'm always trying to figure out how to get to.","In my ideal world there would be 99% unemployment for actors, and I would be the 1% that's employed. I hear about somebody getting a job at Starbucks and I get jealous.","I've never seen anyone handling pans in the streets of New York, and if I did I doubt I'd give them money, unless I needed a pan. I do give money to homeless people, whether they ask or no.","I invested all my money in debt.","When you're making a pilot, what you're mostly thinking is, 'Please let this be a real job, please.'"],"Hamlin Garland":["Whenever the pressure of our complex city life thins my blood and numbs my brain, I seek relief in the trail; and when I hear the coyote wailing to the yellow dawn, my cares fall from me - I am happy.","I remember a hundred lovely lakes, and recall the fragrant breath of pine and fir and cedar and poplar trees. The trail has strung upon it, as upon a thread of silk, opalescent dawns and saffron sunsets.","My recollection of a hundred lovely lakes has given me blessed release from care and worry and the troubled thinking of our modern day. It has been a return to the primitive and the peaceful.","There is no gilding of setting sun or glamor of poetry to light up the ferocious and endless toil of the farmers' wives."],"Hampton Sides":["I'm not a huge soccer fan, but I follow the sport. I played in high school, a little bit in college, played on various club teams most of my life, and all three of my sons are competitive soccer players and far better than I ever was.","Probably the biggest influence on my career was the late John Hersey, who, while he was at 'The New Yorker,' wrote one of the masterpieces of narrative non-fiction, 'Hiroshima.' Hersey was a teacher of mine at Yale, and a friend. He got me to see the possibility of journalism not just as a business but as an art form.","I majored in Southern history in college, and much of my early work at my first job - as a staff writer at 'Memphis' magazine - focused on race relations.","I love Memphis, I guess you could say, in the way that you love a brother even if he does sometimes puzzle and sadden and frustrate you. Say what you want about it, it's an authentic place. I was born and raised in Memphis, and no matter where I go, Memphis belongs to me, and I to it.","America is an archipelago of tribes, a land where people form national families of kindred spirits.","The Tea Party has very close affinities with independent third-party movements like the George Wallace movement. The Tea Party is still inchoate, still trying to figure out what it's going to become.","I don't concentrate on any one period of history; I like to locate my stories in wildly different eras and places. I seem to be drawn to large, sprawling, uncomfortable swaths of American history, finding embedded within them a tight narrative that involves strife, heroism, and survival under difficult circumstances.","I find there's a thin, permeable membrane between journalism and history, and though some academic historians take a dim view of it, I gather a lot of strength and professional inspiration from passing back and forth across it.","By the age of nine or ten, I knew that I loved history and writing. It got hold of me and never turned loose.","When the Americans were trying to conquer the Navajos, they felt this need to capture Canyon de Chelly like it was the Navajo capital. It was a meeting place and a sanctuary of last refuge. To control Canyon de Chelly was to control the Navajo people.","Sometimes it takes a brush with eternity - a crash, an illness, some shock to the system - to get you really thinking about what you want to do with your limited time here, and why you're living on this wobbling dirt clod in the first place.","The forties are the time when you begin to take notice of certain aches and pains. Your body and brain behave in inexplicable ways: Less hair on your head, more in your ears and nostrils. More memories in the bank, less synaptic firepower with which to access them. Gravity has started to show its inexorable pull.","I'm not a Man U fan at all, but I can't get enough of Rooney. What a joy to watch!","The thing about Memphis is that it's pleasingly off-kilter. It's a great big whack job of a city. The anti-Atlanta. You go there, and you can't believe the things people will say, the way they think, the wobbling orbits of their lives. There's an essential otherness.","Americans have a profound longing for heroes - now perhaps more than ever. We need our explorers, our sports icons, our Medal of Freedom winners, our Nobel laureates. We need our Greatest Generation warriors, our 'Sully' Sullenbergers, our Neil Armstrongs. On some level, we still subscribe to the myth of the man in the white hat.","I am not one of those people who believe that MLK achieved more in martyrdom than he could have if he'd lived: imagine what a guiding influence he could have on the world were he still among us.","I think of America not so much as a single country but as a constellation of groups out there competing for air time, energetically expressing themselves and luxuriating in their right to govern themselves. Freedom is that great vaunted word that's always applied to our country - and rightly so.","I've sort of been an anthropologist of modern America, in a non-academic way. Whether it's Marines or Tupperware salesladies, high end audiophiles or bike couriers, I'm fascinated by the hallmarks of the American tribe."],"Hamza Yusuf":["I've said some things about other religions that I regret now. I think they were incorrect.","Reason cannot calm the storm of emotion, and emotion usually wins, until it settles down and allows reason to rise again and apologize on behalf of it.","All of the people are the dependents of Allah.","My great, great grandfather, Michael O'Hanson, fled the impending potato famine of Ireland and arrived in America in the early 1840s with his bride, Bridget. They headed for Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love and a mecca for Irish-Catholic immigrants then.","There are many ways to be hungry. One can hunger for love, or fame or social justice, but hunger for food seems to curb all other cravings.","Our duty is to be patient.","Corruption is rife in the Muslim world, and when it is coupled with the marginalization of religion, it manifests itself as frustration and becomes a fertile recruiting ground for extremism.","Ideas must counter ideas. You can drop all the bombs you want, but if you don't pull up weeds by their roots, they just grow back.","Palestine is the issue, and until this issue is resolved, there can be no peace.","A tree grows. If you're staying the same, something is wrong. You're not alive.","Whatever one thinks of the wisdom of building a mosque near Ground Zero, this controversy now affords us an immense opportunity to examine who we are as a people. It provides us with the opportunity to get back to our foundational ideals, which have always stood as a beacon for the rest of the world.","Stop taking pictures and start experiencing life.","In being aware of others' hunger, we contribute to a more empathic world.","Much to the chagrin of the staunchly secular among us, religion shows no sign of going away. Predictions of the demise of religion, faith, tradition - and even God - have consistently been proven wrong.","Many people in the West do not realise how oppressive some Muslim states are - both for men and for women. This is a cultural issue, not an Islamic one.","To be aware of others' accomplishments and the indebtedness we have to so many people is to appreciate and begin to respect all members of the human family.","All peoples have contributed to the overall progress and enhancement of human life.","Islam was hijacked on that September 11, 2001, on that plane, as an innocent victim.","I would rather live as a Muslim in the West than in most of the Muslim countries, because I think the way Muslims are allowed to live in the West is closer to the Muslim way.","September 11 was a wake-up call to me. I don't want to contribute to the hate in any shape or form. I now regret in the past being silent about what I have heard in the Islamic discourse and being part of that with my own anger.","Katrina did much more damage than anything the terrorists could ever put together.","People can't think when their minds are clouded with fear.","The fear tactic is a tactic that's used by people who want to maintain control, and it's very effective.","A democracy is predicated on an educated citizenry. You cannot have a democracy with people that are more interested in what Nicole Kidman is doing or whoever the latest fashion model is.","When a man wrote a political screed against the IRS and flew into its building, he was deemed mentally ill, even though it was clearly a political act. There's a double standard, which is: If his name is Muhammad, it's automatically terrorism.","America is about choices, including those to live certain lifestyles.","I know that people can live celibate lives. I did it myself for many years.","ISIS is very similar to the Kharijites, who were a toxic off-shoot of Islam. It's not Islam; it's a perversion of Islam, and to label these militant externalities as Islam is to legitimize their actions.","If you don't have religious fallibilism, you have immense problems.","You don't fight ideas with bombs.","My alignment is with what I perceive as just and fair. If it's with the Muslims, then I'm with the Muslims, if it's with the West then I'm with the West. It's about justice and fairness.","I don't align myself with the West of the Muslim world. I align myself with what I perceive to be just and in accordance with my principles - the principles that I live my life by which are universal principles and that are embodied in the religion of Islam.","I really believe that carpet-bombing, bombing civilian populations, is a form of terror - it's state terror as opposed to vigilante terrorism.","I think that the idea of a war on an abstract noun is unacceptable.","Americans are generally decent and fair people with a commitment to sense, but some of us, swept up by our passions, wade too far into a sea of sensibility.","The greatest preventative to terrorism is Muslim religious literacy.","The acquisition of knowledge - knowledge of both the world and of their own religion - will inoculate young people against extremist ideologies.","For believers, both privilege and privation are a trial, and both demand responses: one demands service, and the other demands patience. The greatest privilege is to live well in flourishing lands; the greatest privation is to live in the midst of war, especially civil war.","Our world is increasingly interdependent and pluralistic, and in order to ensure a civil future, we must get to know one another.","The human family is a great one, and the Muslim branch is certainly worth knowing.","You can condemn and criticize religion... all those things are fine, but you can't mock and disrespect people.","Radicalization is very easy when you mock what people hold dear.","The entrenched beliefs many westerners profess about Islam often reveal more about the West than they do about Islam or Muslims.","The Islamic tradition does show some areas of apparent incompatibility with the goals of women in the West, and Muslims have a long way to go in their attitudes towards women. But blaming the religion is again to express an ignorance both of the religion and of the historical struggle for equality of women in Muslim societies.","As a Westerner, the child of civil rights and anti-war activists, I embraced Islam not in abandonment of my core values, drawn almost entirely from the progressive tradition, but as an affirmation of them.","We Muslims in the West, like Jews before us, grapple with the same issues that Jews of the past did: integration or isolation, tradition or reform, intermarriage or intra-marriage.","Where you don't have people who have strong intellectual capacity, you get demagoguery.","The Jews would have us believe that God had this bias to this little small tribe in the middle of the Sinai Desert, and all the rest of humanity is just rubbish. I mean, that is the basic doctrine of the Jewish religion, and that's why it is a most racist religion.","God is much greater than anything we can imagine.","Muslims are not ashamed of their Prophet's teaching about war. On the contrary, for us it is a great source of pride.","The true object of war fought for God should always be peace.","Every day, my love for Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, increases.","To the solace of his name, simply saying 'Muhammad' has an incredibly soothing effect on me.","We want to counter the idea that Muslims and non-Muslims can't live together. This is not who we are or who we want to be.","We don't have any power other than our intellect and our hearts.","I think the Hajj tends to reflect the state of the Ummah. That's one of the things about the Hajj is that you get to see the Ummah. It's a microcosm of the Ummah's condition.","A lot of our leadership has become acutely aware of speaking more fairly, of speaking more balanced, of recognizing that hate speech in any form, even if it comes out of emotional anger, is dangerous.","The thing I love most about going to a book store is the self-help section is the biggest section because Americans know we're screwed up. We know it. But we want to get better.","I think all this Facebook stuff should just stop!","Live your lives. Go out; take walks amongst trees.","We must assert to the Abrahamic people that we are the last extension of the Abrahamic religion... There is no such thing as an Islamic tribe.","Hunger can bring out the worst in us.","Certainly, hunger can bring out the worst in us. But it can also bring out the best."],"Han Fei":["A wise ruler, when he makes his laws, is bound to find himself in conflict with the world.","I believe it is impossible to be sure of anything.","The object of rewards is to encourage; that of punishments, to prevent. If rewards are high, then what the ruler wants will be quickly effected; if punishments are heavy, what he does not want will be swiftly prevented.","A filial son to his father can be a traitorous subject to his ruler.","The duties of the ruler are like those of the helmsman of a great ship. From his lofty position, he makes slight movements with his hands, and the ship, of itself, follows his desires and moves. This is the way whereby the one may control the ten thousand and by quiescence may regulate activity.","Superior and inferior wage one hundred battles a day.","The severe household has no fierce slaves, but it is the affectionate mother.","Those who serve as ministers can be compared to hands: reaching up, they take care of the head; reaching down, they take care of the feet.","A ruler makes use of the majority and neglects the minority, and so he does not devote himself to virtue but to law.","The intelligent ruler makes the law select men and makes no arbitrary appointment himself; he makes the law measure merits and makes no arbitrary judgment himself.","If a ruler can get rid of private crookedness and promote the public law, his people will become secure, and his state will become well ordered.","The ruler who possesses methods of government does not follow the good that happens by chance but practices according to necessary principles. Law, methods, and power must be employed for government: these constitute its 'necessary principles.'","The intelligent ruler does not value people who are of themselves good without rewards and punishments. Why is that? The laws of the state cannot be neglected, and it is not one man who is being ruled.","He who is vain and delights in his own ability is deceived by his inferiors. When he likes to bring forth arguments and kindliness, his inferiors take advantage of his abilities.","A ruler of men faces two possible misfortunes: if he employs the worthy, the ministers will use worthiness as a pretext to rob their ruler of his power, but if he promotes men recklessly, his affairs will be neglected, and he will not prevail.","If you rely on political factions to promote men to office, the people will work to develop instrumental relationships and will not seek to be useful with regard to the law. Thus, a ruler who mistakes reputation for ability when assigning offices will see his state fall into disorder.","If a ruler of men wants to put an end to vice, he must examine the correspondence between form and name and look to see how what is said differs from what is done.","A wise man, when he writes a book, sets forth his arguments fully and clearly; an enlightened ruler, when he makes his laws, sees to it that every contingency is provided for in detail.","If ministers forget their ruler and establish relationships with foreign powers in order to advance the interests of their confederates, there will be scant reason for subordinates to obey their superiors.","When an enlightened ruler controls his ministers, he makes it so that ministers cannot get credit for achievements gained by overstepping the bounds of their offices or make proposals and then fail to match them with actual achievements.","Within the frontiers of a state, there are no more than ten people who do good of themselves, whereas if one makes it so that the people can do no wrong, the entire state can be kept peaceful.","The Way is the beginning of the ten thousand things and the guiding thread of truth and falsity.","The Way of an enlightened ruler is to make it so that no minister may make a proposal and then fail to match it with actions and results.","The people in the well-ordered ages of the past upheld the public law and abandoned private strategies; they focused their intentions and unified their conduct. Everything they did was for the sake of being employed by the ruler.","The severe household has no fierce slaves, while it is the affectionate mother who has the prodigal son."],"Han Suyin":["There is nothing stronger in the world than gentleness.","I really can't hate more than 5 or 10 years. Wouldn't it be terrible to be always burdened with those primary emotions you had at one time?","Love from one being to another can only be that two solitudes come nearer, recognize and protect and comfort each other."],"Hani Furstenberg":["I hope the English-speaking world can see that I'm not only an Israeli actress.","I've been able to work with great directors in Israel.","When I was growing up, I was teased for being too skinny. I went to summer camp when I was 11. I wore shorts, and the nurse said to me, in front of all my friends, that I was anorexic and that she had to monitor me to make sure I was eating. Because of that trauma, I never wore short pants or short skirts until I was 20.","For Americans I'll always be Israeli, and for Israelis I'll always be American. But I really have no need for definitions.","I'm an actress, and that's my work and my passion."],"Haniel Long":["So much of what is best in us is bound up in our love of family, that it remains the measure of our stability because it measures our sense of loyalty. All other pacts of love or fear derive from it and are modeled upon it.","A gang is the same as a wolf pack; gang members do not use their energies in friendship with one another, for they do not know what friendship is. If they are united, it is by the common bond of a desire to attack their world.","When people discuss religion, it is a pity that they often become excited and argue. We should merely listen, as one does on a dark night; we should merely gaze at the stars.","To strip a man of all loyalties but those to the state, makes him not only a worm but a monster, without a shred of humanity.","A man's motive in the small actions of daily life, like resting a moment on his pitchfork in the sun and listening intently, may be the most important thing about that man.","The moment one accosts a stranger or is accosted by him is above all in this life the moment of drama... Whoever we meet watches us intently at the quick, strange moment of meeting, to see whether we are disposed to be friendly.","Free people make the only milieu possible in society for the full gift of one's self to church, state, and family. Free people enjoy and sustain and feel with one another because they live for one another. The paths of life are intermingled lives.","For support, I fall back on my heart. Has a man any fault a woman cannot weave with and try to change into something better, if the god her man prays to is a mother holding a baby?","When I meet a new person, I am on the lookout for signs of what he or she is loyal to. It is a preliminary clue to the sense of belonging, and hence of his or her humanity.","The most frightening pages of history are those which reveal how easily conditions making a desert of the human spirit may come into existence, with the oozings away of incentive and kindliness in our natural social structure.","And who is any of us, that without starvation he can go through the kingdoms of starvation?","Surely no one can be sure he has visited Cienega; people say to themselves, do they not: 'Was it a vision; or have I, some time or other, seen dusk in a valley like this?'","Certainly there are great men whose age circumscribes them so completely that we lose interest.","I do not believe that we can stop perfecting new ways of dying until we have found new ways of living. Every new life-way ought to prevent a new death-way.","I am no theologian. I am a layman. I am among those who are preached to, and who listen. It is not for me to preach. I should not willingly forego being a listener, a man who reads the Gospels and then listens to what others say that our Lord meant. But sometimes a listener speaks out, and listens to his own voice.","Dead men tell no tales."],"Hanif Kureishi":["I am determined to live without illusions. I want to look at reality straight. Without hiding.","'Anna Karenina' is just a story about a woman falling in love with a bloke who is not her husband. It's gossip, rubbish - on the other hand, it's the deepest story there could be about social transgression, about love, betrayal, duty, children.","I'm always writing. I'm an obsessive. It's not because I'm a disciplined person. It's because I'm crazy about it.","I'm interested in philosophical psychology, people like Nietzsche, Freud, Alcan, Foucault, Derrida.","It seemed to me that the real philosophical breakthroughs of the 20th century were in terms of the understanding of language. What is language? Where does it come from, how does it work, what does it do?","I've never had any desire to be good. I don't like goodness particularly.","If you get depressed, you can be stuck for months; if you have an analyst, you at least have a chance of getting out of it faster.","I guess writing is a kind of therapy in the sense that there are things you need to say and you say them, and better out than in.","My father was a civil servant, so having a regular job, being respectable is a big deal for me. Respectable in the sense that I support my family. That's what I mean by respectability.","You can't spend your life beating yourself up for something that happened yesterday. You die if you don't follow your desire."],"Hank Aaron":["My motto was always to keep swinging. Whether I was in a slump or feeling badly or having trouble off the field, the only thing to do was keep swinging.","It took me seventeen years to get three thousand hits in baseball. I did it in one afternoon on the golf course.","I never doubted my ability, but when you hear all your life you're inferior, it makes you wonder if the other guys have something you've never seen before. If they do, I'm still looking for it.","I tell young people - including my granddaughter - there is no shortcut in life. You have to take it one step at a time and work hard. And you have to give back.","Guessing what the pitcher is going to throw is 80% of being a successful hitter. The other 20% is just execution.","For many years, even after Jackie Robinson, baseball was so segregated, really. You just didn't expect us to have a chance to do anything. Baseball was meant for the lily-white.","The thing I like about baseball is that it's one-on-one. You stand up there alone, and if you make a mistake, it's your mistake. If you hit a home run, it's your home run.","Too bad integration didn't come sooner, because there were so many ballplayers that could have made the major leagues. That's why, you look back, and - not to take away anything from Babe Ruth or some of those other guys - they didn't play against the greatest ballplayers in the world.","The triple is the most exciting play in baseball. Home runs win a lot of games, but I never understood why fans are so obsessed with them.","The pitcher has got only a ball. I've got a bat. So the percentage in weapons is in my favor and I let the fellow with the ball do the fretting.","Failure is a part of success.","You can only milk a cow so long, then you're left holding the pail.","On the field, blacks have been able to be super giants. But, once our playing days are over, this is the end of it and we go back to the back of the bus again.","People were not ready to accept me as a baseball player. The easiest part of that whole thing, chasing the Babe's record, was playing the game itself. The hardest thing was after the game was over, dealing with the press. They could never understand.","I never thought we'd ever have a black president. President Obama has done such a tremendous job... He just has been unable to get what he needs to be moved at the level it should be moved.","I looked for the same pitch my whole career, a breaking ball. All of the time. I never worried about the fastball. They couldn't throw it past me, none of them.","I never smile when I have a bat in my hands. That's when you've got to be serious. When I get out on the field, nothing's a joke to me. I don't feel like I should walk around with a smile on my face.","I am very proud to be an American. This country has so much potential, I'd just like to see things better, or whatever, and I think it will be.","I don't see pitches down the middle anymore - not even in batting practice.","I'm hoping someday that some kid, black or white, will hit more home runs than myself. Whoever it is, I'd be pulling for him.","Didn't come up here to read. Came up here to hit.","I don't feel right unless I have a sport to play or at least a way to work up a sweat.","Some people resented the fact I was trying to break a white man's record.","Sure, this country has a black president, but when you look at a black president, President Obama is left with his foot stuck in the mud from all of the Republicans with the way he's treated.","Jackie was speaking at a drugstore, and I said, 'I'm not going to get this opportunity again, so I better take my chances and listen to Jackie Robinson now.' Little did I know, I got front row seats, and next to me was my father."],"Hank Azaria":["Being funny with a funny voice is more my comfort zone, a broader character that I try to humanize, a kind of silly or wacky persona that I try to fill in.","The Iraq War. No one took to the streets over it. It certainly would have been appropriate. If anybody even hinted we should... you were called un-American and not supporting the troops.","When I was young in L.A. and I couldn't get into clubs or restaurants, I would call imitating celebrities and get a table, and it would work often. I was either Stallone or Mickey Rourke: 'This is Sly. I may be late, but my buddy Hank will be there early.'","When you're on a series that's been cancelled, there's a little bit of a stink on you.","I ask for a lot of advice from different fathers - all kinds of dads.","Godzilla's a monster for the '90s. He's been working out.","I've been doing silly voices since I was a child.","In my cranky old age, I actually prefer recording alone now, on 'The Simpsons,' for example, because I find that the director can just focus on what I'm doing and I can do a lot of variations. A lot of times, when I record with a group, I'll stay after class for another hour or two.","Just watching Jack Lemmon made me want to get into this business.","The 'Family Ties' role was the first of many gay roles that I've ended up playing. I remember that I made them laugh, and it made me feel good, 'cause it really cracked them up.","I was a huge fan of comedy and movies and TV growing up, and I was able to memorize and mimic a lot of things, not realizing that that meant I probably wanted to be an actor. I just really, really amused myself and my friends with memorizing entire George Carlin or Steve Martin albums.","I was 16 and did a play at school. I was a rather good student... And then I did a play when I was 16 and completely lost all my concentration for academics.","I did a lot of theater in college, and I knew that not many people make it, but I just figured, 'Well, I really want to try acting while I'm young, and I don't ever want to look back and say that I never gave it a try.' I fully figured I'd be back in grad school - probably for psychology.","Women are, in general, less shallow visually. If their man gains 10, 20 pounds, they don't care as much. But I've been with women over the years when my weight fluctuated, and they're definitely more interested physically when I am in really great shape.","Guys will definitely settle for women who get the joke. But a woman who can make you laugh? It's not high on a guy's must list. Perhaps it should be.","My ultimate is Peter Sellers - his ability to go broad and somehow humanize that and be hilarious at the same time. He was just relatable, real at the same time as insane. I find Ricky Gervais absolutely hilarious. Steve Martin is another hero of mine - he's a genius.","I've done literally 100, 150 different characters. Some of them have only appeared for a line or three. But the point is, every sound I can make has been harvested.","I've been divorced and I had to get back out there be single again and do some of that in the genuinely miserable state where you really do wonder what the hell is going on. And you feel like trying to have casual conversation with someone you don't know on the surface of the moon or something.","You can't be funny for funny's sake. You try to get as outrageous situation as you can but it always has to be believable and based in real character motivations and what people would really do.","The craft Emmys are kind of the kids' table at Thanksgiving. You're not really invited to the big dance. It's still really, really exciting, and the statue still counts.","I love acting, but I want to explore other things.","There's no experience like on-the-job training.","You know those award shows. The cliche is that it's an honor just to be nominated, but that happens to be true. Whoever wins it in the end, I don't know, sometimes it feels arbitrary. Sometimes it feels like it's deserving.","I don't really remember much about the '60s at all. You know, 1970 is the first year I remember pretty well.","You know, I was a huge fan of comedy and movies and TV growing up, and I was able to memorize and mimic a lot of things, not realizing that that meant I probably wanted to be an actor.","I had kind of sworn off network TV a while ago.","When you do well in a movie that's seen as really great, you're revitalized for six weeks.","I bartended for a catering company for two or three years.","I'm very happy I get to keep working - it's an insanely fortunate thing.","I wore a thong and a bra and a wig. Those things hurt. I mean, thongs? Like, they dig in. It takes a tough man to be a woman.","I joke that my niche in Hollywood has been naked foreigners.","Women are, in general, less shallow visually. If their man gains 10, 20 pounds, they don't care as much.","Getting over someone is a grieving process. You mourn the loss of the relationship, and that's only expedited by 'Out of sight, out of mind.' But when you walk outside and see them on a billboard or on TV or on the cover of a magazine, it reopens the wound. It's a high-class problem, but it's real.","I've done literally 100, 150 different characters.","I have no new voices - they've all been used.","A lot of times, when I record with a group, I'll stay after class for another hour or two and go, 'Let me try a bunch of things I was thinking of, as you were doing that.'","You have to always physicalize, when you do animation recording. Otherwise, you won't get the performance right.","I would love to do Broadway again.","When you mimic everyone, sometimes authority figures really don't appreciate it which is not an original story. And pretty much every comedian has some tale of that.","I tend to not watch things that are current. And then if everybody swears it's amazing then I'll like watch the whole series in a weekend.","It's not really difficult to go from one voice into the next.","It's always impressive when talented comedians are easy laughers or generous with their laughs."],"Hank Ballard":["Rock 'n' roll is good for the soul, for the well being, for the psyche, for your everything. I love it.","I can't even picture being without rock 'n'roll."],"Hank Haney":["My feeling was, you plant some seeds. If they grow, great; if they don't, you don't take it personally. Not my problem; I just kept planting. Just like a farmer.","One of the things you realize with a lot of high achievers: You have to figure out a way to make things their idea.","I know I was a great friend to Tiger Woods. But when you have a relationship that's involves business and friendship - and the business part comes to an end - things always get a little blurry.","Well it's not easy being Tiger Woods on the course. It's not easy being Tiger Woods off the course. In his defense, it's not easy being Tiger Woods.","To have the opportunity to work with Tiger Woods was just so awesome. I enjoyed it. I enjoyed the challenge. I enjoyed the good parts where he was winning. And I enjoyed the challenge to help him get better. But six years was enough.","I've been ripped for being too sensitive, but I do think people need to walk in another person's shoes before they accuse them of being too sensitive.","Does anyone actually think I'm going to call Tiger Woods and tell him what to do with his swing one day, and he's going to go out and do it, simple as that? It doesn't work like that."],"Hank Johnson":["Social Security is not just another government spending program. It is a promise from generation to generation.","The rising costs of higher education coupled with the stress of paying student loans are putting increasing pressure on students.","Because Social Security has not contributed to our debt, Americans should be skeptical of any politician who says that benefits Americans have earned must be reduced in order to address our national debt.","Programs like food stamps, unemployment insurance, Medicaid, and job retraining help Americans get back on their feet when they are down and out and laid off through no fault of their own.","As Americans, we have the right to decide who lives within our borders, and we can't let unscrupulous employers to undercut honest business owners by exploiting cheap labor.","I stand with the millions of seniors and working people who depend on Social Security and who expect the money they put in to be there for them when they retire.","Love it or hate it, Obamacare is the law of the land. It was passed by Congress, signed into law by President Obama, declared constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court and ratified by a majority of Americans, who reelected the president for a second term.","The myopic obsession of the Tea Party with destroying health care reform and wounding the president has led Republicans astray.","Students graduating with high debt encounter difficulties in qualifying for home and automobile loans.","Any cut to Pell Grants means low-income must take out additional loans or work longer hours - risk factors that increase their odds of dropping out of school.","College dropouts with significant debt struggle with repayment over the course of their lives and do not receive the benefits afforded to their peers who have debt but obtain higher-paying jobs as a result of college completion.","America deserves common sense immigration reform that reflects our interests and our values as Americans.","Most Americans have parents or grandparents who immigrated to this country, and we know the hardships they faced, from learning the language to dealing with prejudice.","I agree with President Roosevelt, and generations since, that American seniors deserve better than poverty.","Most people seem unaware that corporate influence and wealth has taken over public policy, such that government policy now favors the wealthy few at the expense of the people.","As more government functions are privatized, we find political leaders defunding the public school system, shifting government funds to the private, for-profit school industry.","The idea that corporations have the same First Amendment protections of free speech as people is troubling. Corporations are not people. They don't attend our schools, get married and have children. They don't vote in our elections.","The American people have a right to know the source of the money that is being spent. They should be told who is behind the millions of dollars in campaign ads, and they should receive this information before they vote.","Billionaires like the Koch brothers, casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, and political puppet master Karl Rove should not be able to buy our elections. Secret money should not be able to drown out the voices of the American people and sell our Democracy to the highest bidder.","The military is a machine of war. Not a law enforcement agency.","Even as technology becomes increasingly critical to the way we live our lives, power our world and defend our shores, the United States has allowed the production of minerals crucial in the creation of these advanced products to slide."],"Hank Ketcham":["Flattery is like chewing gum. Enjoy it but don't swallow it.","No more turkey, but I'd like some more of the bread it ate.","Anyone in the humor business isn't thinking clearly if he doesn't surround himself with idea people. Otherwise, you settle for mediocrity - or you burn yourself out."],"Hank Sauer":["I lost the ball in the moon.","But when I go to Chicago, I know I'm home.","The first week Banks was with us, we knew he was going to be a star.","I don't know how it started but someone must have noticed I was always chewing tobacco or smoking a pipe.","After I'd hit a home run and took my position in the field, the fans in the bleachers began throwing packages of tobacco at me. I stuffed them in my pocket.","The fans treated me royally."],"Hank Snow":["I've had about 140 albums released, and I've done everything I wanted to do.","It's really sort of morbid, but she said her mother wanted to see me all her life. And when she died, she made just one request: that a picture of me be put into her casket. So somewhere in England, I'm in a casket."],"Hank Stram":["You can't be fat and fast, too; so lift, run, diet and work.","Yesterday is a cancelled check. Today is cash on the line. Tomorrow is a promissory note.","You can't win unless you have good people with great attitude. They are the ones who won the games. I didn't win any games. You never saw a coach make a tackle anywhere. My philosophy was to get the best players and then try to do something new with them.","My philosophy? Simplicity plus variety.","As I matriculate my way down the field of life, I will never forget this moment and you wonderful people who helped make this day possible.","I've lived a charmed life. I married the only girl I ever loved and did the only job I ever loved.","The receivers are an integral part of the passing game.","The honor I feel today being inducted into the Hall of Fame is beyond what words can describe. My thanks to the Hall of Fame committee, who saw fit to bestow this great honor upon me today.","There are few secrets in football. So execute.","You cannot win if you cannot run.","When I have the urge to get back to coaching, I lie down and wait until it passes.","I always felt if you were going to be successful, make sure you get good people. You win with great players. Coaches don't win games. Players win games."],"Hank Williams":["You got to have smelt a lot of mule manure before you can sing like a hillbilly.","I was a pretty good imitator of Roy Acuff, but then I found out they already had a Roy Acuff, so I started singin' like myself."],"Hanna Rosin":["There are always signs that a reign is ending, and they are usually spotted not in the king himself but in his court. In the inner circle, latent jealousies between advisers spill into open conflict, as they angrily debate who is to blame for the calamity, chewing over each other's past errors and pointing the finger at old and nascent enemies.","The launch of a space shuttle can still make you weep with amazement and wonder, if you happen to be watching it.","For nearly as long as civilization has existed, patriarchy - enforced through the rights of the firstborn son - has been the organizing principle, with few exceptions.","Every new medium has, within a short time of its introduction, been condemned as a threat to young people. Pulp novels would destroy their morals, TV would wreck their eyesight, video games would make them violent.","If men can quilt and take over the kitchen, then women can pick up a wrench and fix a leaky pipe.","I grew up with a pretty tough mom. She was a self-appointed neighborhood watchdog, and if she saw that any of the local boys were up to no good, she would scold them on the spot. Although she is only 5 feet 2, she was famous in our neighborhood for intimidating men three times her size and getting them to do the right thing.","Women are just much better at getting degrees than men. It seems that school at every level plays to the natural strengths of women more than it does to men.","With the Jews, the questions are always open; we're always questioning. I love that questioning tradition.","Pop culture is like our subconscious.","If my own current husband was suddenly a stay-at-home dad, it would be emasculating. That would be hard for me.","Most days I struggle just to be accepted into the camp of plain old feminists. This is mainly because I am not by nature ideological and generally suspicious of people who are.","Fixing things around the house was the last bastion of manliness. But now, even that is getting taken away. As women become more economically independent, they are starting to fix things around the house for themselves.","The modern economy is becoming a place where women hold the cards.","Women are choosing to stay single rather than marry men who can't step up and provide.","Men need marriage more than women do. In fact, they need it to survive.","Women don't give up things. They don't give up responsibilities. They add new things. They exhaust themselves and still don't give anything up. And. And. And. And. And they do all these other things at the same time, which can be exhausting.","Women have taken on traditionally masculine roles and professions, and there is no real equivalent for men. Men are still extremely reluctant, as we all are reluctant to see them, take on traditionally feminine roles or professions. That is just not something that they do easily.","Men and women are equally intelligent, but separate factors, such as the abilities to focus, be collaborative and take other people's views into account, allow you to be successful.","Blog culture has a hard time digesting narratives, but it has an easy time digesting 'big ideas' pieces.","You need to prepare the child you have for the world that exists.","Women had a rights movement where they fought for changes. Men... don't band together in quite that way. It happens not in such a public-cascade way as in a house-to-house way.","I could do a franchise for the end of everything. 'The End of Dogs,' 'The End of Cats.'","Attachment parenting demands not just certain actions you take with your baby but also certain emotional states to accompany those actions.","Yes, the upper reaches of society are still dominated by men.","Maybe there's something about the outsiderness of being Jewish that makes for a fiery feminist type.","For women in, say, Alabama, 'feminism' is a dirty word. They would never march in the streets. But although they don't think of themselves as the beneficiaries of feminism, they are.","Women have a tendency not to give up realms once they take over new ones. We are still proprietary over the domestic realm even as we take over new professional realms, and that is a real problem.","Because women have been marginalised, they're more likely to behave like immigrants and continue to push themselves forward in order to avoid falling through the cracks, but I don't think a happy ending comes from matriarchy.","Interestingly, one thing I've found that neither women nor men give up on is the idea of men as protectors. Even in cases where the woman is earning more, they'll often tell me that if there were a fire or something, they would expect the man to be the one to protect them.","I grew up in a working-class Israeli family, which was feminist only in its female-dominated structure.","I think we should all call ourselves feminists.","If you look at total numbers in the working and middle class, men still on average make more than women.","Green jobs - those are jobs that feel like new economy jobs; they do require some training.","Factories not what they used to be - they're all extremely high-tech.","We're so marriage-obsessed, we think that only married people are families.","The general image of a man in an American sitcom is like a complete moron. You'd think the industry was run by a feminist cabal.","Workplaces still operate like it's 1962 and one person is always at home, and they are not very good at adjusting for the fact that a majority of women work and take care of children.","I deeply believe that men and women need each other.","There is no 'natural' order, only the way things are.","Although they are unfailingly gracious, evangelicals are not so good at respecting professional boundaries.","The first time someone tried to share the Gospel with me, I naively explained that I was Jewish and born in Israel, thank you... This was a big mistake. In certain parts of Christian America, admitting I was an Israeli-born Jew turned me into walking catnip.","Evolutionary psychology tells us that men, especially powerful men, feel invincible and entitled to spread their seed, and that women can't resist the scent of masculine power. Women, by contrast, are said to be more altruistic and collaborative, seeking power so that they can share it with others.","Every congresswoman surely endures the same strains that drive some of her male colleagues to have affairs: lots of travel, families far away, heady work that makes a domestic routine seem distant and boring. But the stakes are much higher for women, because they are still judged by a different standard.","As we get used to women in power, we are likely to discover that they behave much like powerful men - vain, entitled, always looking for more.","The classic war movies of the post-Vietnam era have generally taken on grand, philosophical themes: the meaninglessness of war, the grinding down of man by the machine - the machine being war itself, represented by someone like Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in 'Full Metal Jacket,' the sadistic marine who turns his boys into instruments of death.","To apply for a gifted program, children as young as 4 are required to sit through hour-long verbal exams.","We've heard that the hookup culture is destroying us. We've heard that it's saving us. We've heard that it's racist. We've agonized over which one of these is true.","There comes a point in nearly every book event I've done when a little feminist revolt stirs inside the crowd.","Breast-feeding does not belong in the realm of facts and hard numbers; it is much too intimate and elemental.","In American fertility clinics, 75 percent of couples are requesting girls and not boys.","In China, a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship is happening because women are starting businesses, small businesses, faster than men.","For most of American history, of course, the important religious divides were between denominations - not just between Protestants and Catholics and Jews but between Lutherans and Episcopalians and Southern Baptists and the other endlessly fine-tuned sects.","On the one hand, parents want their children to swim expertly in the digital stream that they will have to navigate all their lives; on the other hand, they fear that too much digital media, too early, will sink them.","Previously, young children had to be shown by their parents how to use a mouse or a remote, and the connection between what they were doing with their hand and what was happening on the screen took some time to grasp. But with the iPad, the connection is obvious, even to toddlers.","Ever since viewing screens entered the home, many observers have worried that they put our brains into a stupor. An early strain of research claimed that when we watch television, our brains mostly exhibit slow alpha waves - indicating a low level of arousal, similar to when we are daydreaming.","The average American worker gets something like 14 days of paid vacation. In my school, you'd use up ten of those taking care of your kids on teacher professional days, then tack on a couple more for kids getting sick.","Feminism was about making women's lives less constrained and giving them more choices.","One way the Tea Party has benefited female candidates - and the conservative movement generally - is by consciously steering clear of social issues.","NASA projects often have romantic names that link into a long history of exploration and adventure: Atlantis and Discovery, for example.","Transsexualism is far less common than homosexuality, and the research is in its infancy. Scattered studies have looked at brain activity, finger size, familial recurrence, and birth order.","Studies show that recipients of Section 8 vouchers have tended to choose moderately poor neighborhoods that were already on the decline, not low-poverty neighborhoods.","Where older religions promised heaven, the church of yoga promises quicker, more practical, earthly gratification, in the form of better heart rates and well-toned arms."],"Hannah Arendt":["The trouble with lying and deceiving is that their efficiency depends entirely upon a clear notion of the truth that the liar and deceiver wishes to hide.","Only crime and the criminal, it is true, confront us with the perplexity of radical evil; but only the hypocrite is really rotten to the core.","This is the precept by which I have lived: Prepare for the worst; expect the best; and take what comes.","Power and violence are opposites; where the one rules absolutely, the other is absent. Violence appears where power is in jeopardy, but left to its own course it ends in power's disappearance.","The earth is the very quintessence of the human condition.","Forgiveness is the key to action and freedom.","There are no dangerous thoughts; thinking itself is dangerous.","Promises are the uniquely human way of ordering the future, making it predictable and reliable to the extent that this is humanly possible.","The most radical revolutionary will become a conservative the day after the revolution.","The chief qualification of a mass leader has become unending infallibility; he can never admit an error.","The sad truth is that most evil is done by people who never make up their minds to be good or evil.","Only the mob and the elite can be attracted by the momentum of totalitarianism itself. The masses have to be won by propaganda.","Storytelling reveals meaning without committing the error of defining it.","Death not merely ends life, it also bestows upon it a silent completeness, snatched from the hazardous flux to which all things human are subject.","Revolutionaries do not make revolutions. The revolutionaries are those who know when power is lying in the street and then they can pick it up.","These are the fifties, you know. The disgusting, posturing fifties.","In order to go on living one must try to escape the death involved in perfectionism.","Where all are guilty, no one is; confessions of collective guilt are the best possible safeguard against the discovery of culprits, and the very magnitude of the crime the best excuse for doing nothing.","Total loyalty is possible only when fidelity is emptied of all concrete content, from which changes of mind might naturally arise.","No cause is left but the most ancient of all, the one, in fact, that from the beginning of our history has determined the very existence of politics, the cause of freedom versus tyranny.","Few girls are as well shaped as a good horse.","Poets are the only people to whom love is not only a crucial, but an indispensable experience, which entitles them to mistake it for a universal one.","By its very nature the beautiful is isolated from everything else. From beauty no road leads to reality.","For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.","Wherever the relevance of speech is at stake, matters become political by definition, for speech is what makes man a political being.","The Third World is not a reality but an ideology.","No punishment has ever possessed enough power of deterrence to prevent the commission of crimes. On the contrary, whatever the punishment, once a specific crime has appeared for the first time, its reappearance is more likely than its initial emergence could ever have been.","Nothing we use or hear or touch can be expressed in words that equal what is given by the senses.","Economic growth may one day turn out to be a curse rather than a good, and under no conditions can it either lead into freedom or constitute a proof for its existence.","To be free in an age like ours, one must be in a position of authority. That in itself would be enough to make me ambitious.","It is in the very nature of things human that every act that has once made its appearance and has been recorded in the history of mankind stays with mankind as a potentiality long after its actuality has become a thing of the past.","Culture relates to objects and is a phenomenon of the world; entertainment relates to people and is a phenomenon of life.","We have almost succeeded in leveling all human activities to the common denominator of securing the necessities of life and providing for their abundance.","It is my contention that civil disobediences are nothing but the latest form of voluntary association, and that they are thus quite in tune with the oldest traditions of the country.","The ultimate end of human acts is eudaimonia, happiness in the sense of living well, which all men desire; all acts are but different means chosen to arrive at it.","Under conditions of tyranny it is far easier to act than to think.","Action without a name, a who attached to it, is meaningless.","The new always happens against the overwhelming odds of statistical laws and their probability, which for all practical, everyday purposes amounts to certainty; the new therefore always appears in the guise of a miracle.","The defiance of established authority, religious and secular, social and political, as a world-wide phenomenon may well one day be accounted the outstanding event of the last decade.","The more dubious and uncertain an instrument violence has become in international relations, the more it has gained in reputation and appeal in domestic affairs, specifically in the matter of revolution.","War has become a luxury that only small nations can afford.","Man cannot be free if he does not know that he is subject to necessity, because his freedom is always won in his never wholly successful attempts to liberate himself from necessity.","Our tradition of political thought had its definite beginning in the teachings of Plato and Aristotle. I believe it came to a no less definite end in the theories of Karl Marx."],"Hannah Cowley":["Every body about me seem'd happy but every body seem'd in a hurry to be happy somewhere else.","It requires genius to make a good pun - some men of bright parts can't reach it.","The charms of women were never more powerful never inspired such achievements, as in those immortal periods, when they could neither read nor write.","I have been five minutes too late all my life-time!"],"Hannah Gadsby":["A lot of people have told me they have mothers like my mother. I seriously doubt it.","I would never date a celebrity. I would want someone with real skills. Doctor, nurse, electrician... tailor.","That's the problem with ADHD: I have no focus; I get bored.","The thing about comedy is it gives you a platform to expose your own shortcomings, so it becomes a public display of weirdness.","This adoration of an artist as a lone genius is quite misled, I think, because they are very much part of their time and their community.","My brain is just so busy. I'm inattentive; I'm a daydreamer: the space cadet kind.","I've walked away in the middle of a conversation and had no idea that was wrong until someone told me I was being rude.","Most accountants are strange - let's be honest.","I think most people's view is that selfies are just vanity and stupid, but I think they're really great.","I've always wanted to make Australian art interesting. To get a different audience watching art documentaries would be great.","I don't want to be a didactic voice. I like to ask more questions than I answer, just to get people thinking and to make it safe to access art.","A lot of people are intimated by art, but it's something to be revered beyond criticism."],"Hannah John-Kamen":["I love fantasy; I love imagination - that's the inner child in me.","I have an older brother and sister, and I'm definitely ahead of my years in terms of sci-fi and films. My brother is a massive sci-fi fan, and the Linda Hamilton and Sigourney Weaver era... I was involved and interested.","I don't have a favourite colour!","My dad left his psychology hat at the door and put his dad hat on when he came into the house. It's amazing having my dad have that awesome job. My mother was a model back in the day. I've seen the pictures. My mother's beautiful.","Growing up with strong female role models is always inspiring, and growing up, that was something I aspired to play.","The idea of science fiction, mythology, and creating a world is my favourite thing. I do love the reality of dramas and playing that, but being able to start from scratch, to completely build the character and this world, I love that.","Stunts are my favourite - I love it: the feeling, the adrenaline when all the cameras are rolling and everyone is watching and crowd round.","I remember, for my birthday once, we all dressed up as Spice Girls. I was Scary.","I've always known I was going to perform and live in London.","Sci-fi fans are so interested in your character and so attached to the world that you've created.","I remember the first 'fan expo' we did for 'Killjoys,' we were so new, there wasn't a lot of information out yet. But there were so many fans so excited already. And they were asking really intellectual questions about the show.","I think it's great that you have inspirational female roles, that it's not just the pretty girl on the arm of a man.","I'm not sure why it's taken so long, but I think people are relating to strong female leads.","I knew exactly what I wanted to do since I could remember. As a kid, if my friends came round after school for dinner, I'd put on shows; I'd write plays and charge the parents £1.50 for a ticket for sweetie money.","My parents are so supportive of whatever we want to do and completely nurtured that, and they're so proud of that as well. My sister's a doctor, and I have an older brother as well. He went into the music industry; he's very musically talented."],"Hannah Kearney":["Sometimes the best coaching advice you can get is simple acknowledgement that there's nothing else you could have done.","I savored my time on top of the podium by watching the American flag rise up out of the crowd as the anthem played, thinking about how every single second of training I've done was for this minute and how many people played a role in my achievement.","When you've won a gold medal and you're at the top of your sport, everyone's trying to beat you. I find that incredibly motivating.","I have this dream of what I ultimately want my life to be like, and it involves a lot of quaint activities like cooking and canoeing and camping and hiking.","I am a freestyle mogul skier who, on February 13, became the first American to win a gold medal at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics.","On television, I have watched countless athletes from different countries, sports and Olympics stand proudly at the top of the podium and shed tears. They symbolized the Olympics for me because Olympic medals represent all of the hard work and sacrifices made by the athletes as well as the people who helped them reach the top of their sports.","The experience of being an Olympian is one that can never be taken away from you.","When the United States media is paying attention, that's when you're really representing your country.","I'm a 27-year-old freshman, and returning to college after a seven-year break from high school was by far the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.","It's a fine balance for an athlete in enjoying the moment and being really satisfied, say, with a run, and with your day, and knowing you can make it better in the future.","On the actual competition days, you get about three or four hours of physical exertion - between an hour-long warm-up, recovery in-between runs, the training runs, and then the runs themselves.","I go to the gym in the morning to warm up, and then I go to the mountain and train. Then I come home and go to the gym again to recover. But on travel days, you get pretty much no physical exertion.","One of my favorite snacks is Chobani yogurt with Bear Naked granola, because it has all the nutrients I need; it's all-natural, and it has a lot of protein.","It can be tough when you're on the road, but I think food is meant to be enjoyed, so whenever we go to a new place, we look for the specialty item there.","I have a Rhodesian Ridgeback dog named Lola.","An Olympic gold medal is something that almost seems like a fantasy. Yes, of course I want it, since I was a little kid, before I even knew what the World Cup tour was.","I'm 23 years old and still wearing pigtails.","Unfortunately, my beauty regime is almost nonexistent when I am training.","Because we always have to wear a uniform to compete, my teammates and I look the exact same. My belt is the only accessory that I get to choose. I usually wear a yellow cloth belt with cherries or a leather belt with a beautiful tree buckle that I got at a thrift store.","In my personal life, I really like the look of vests. I wear fitted, business ones, and perfectly preppy sweater vests that I can knit myself.","I don't have any style icons, but I get inspiration from my friends. My style motto is that it is better to be overdressed than underdressed.","To overcome any sort of fear is satisfying, and to overcome it well is even better.","I don't recall ever desiring to go as fast as possible."],"Hannah Kent":["People speak of the fear of the blank canvas as though it is a temporary hesitation, a trembling moment of self-doubt. For me it was more like being abducted from my bed by a clown, thrust into a circus arena with a wicker chair, and told to tame a pissed-off lion in front of an expectant crowd.","I still don't know why, exactly, but I do think people can have a spiritual connection to landscape, and I certainly did in Iceland.","My dad would tell me bedtime stories, and he used to always leave them open-ended and finish at a crucial point with the words, 'dream on'. Then it was my responsibility to finish the story as I was drifting off to sleep. We would call them dreaming stories.","In Iceland, you can see the contours of the mountains wherever you go, and the swell of the hills, and always beyond that the horizon. And there's this strange thing: you're never sort of hidden; you always feel exposed in that landscape. But it makes it very beautiful as well.","I had an interest in Scandinavian countries because I'd never seen snow.","I first heard the story of Agnes Magnusdottir when I was an exchange student in the north of Iceland.","There are secrets at the heart of every story; there is something that must be uncovered or discovered, both by the reader and by the characters.","I applied for funding to embark on an overseas field trip in Iceland, and spent six weeks there happily holed up in the national archives, museums and libraries, sifting through ministerial and parish records, censuses, maps, microfilm, logs, and local histories.","I had expected that at some point during the first draft a light would go on, and I would understand, finally, how to write a book. This never happened. The process was akin to blindly walking in the dark, feeling my way only by touch, and only recognising dead ends when I smacked into them.","I really hate the term 'historical novel' - it reminds me of bodice-rippers. But I'm hooked on research, and I really, really enjoy it.","I used to have 20/20 vision, believe it or not; that's gone because of all the reading I did when I wasn't supposed to, reading in the back of a car, waiting for each street light to go past so I could grab another sentence.","I don't like to pretend I was guided in any way by the supernatural world, but the more you talk about that, the easier it is to dismiss those notions.","When I write, I write for myself, and I have high expectations... so I'm just trying to meet those. I'm not going to distract myself with other people's expectations.","I was a very imaginative child, and my parents were very encouraging of that. My sister and I would put on plays; I would write my own stories.","Most writers are drawn to what is unknown, rather than what is clear in any tale.","The mystery at the center of 'Burial Rites' is not who killed whom on the night of March 13, 1828. It is the mystery each of us encounters: Can we every truly know another? Can we ever truly know ourselves?","I have a deep and ongoing love of Iceland, particular the landscape, and when writing 'Burial Rites,' I was constantly trying to see whether I could distill its extraordinary and ineffable qualities into a kind of poetry.","You know you're going to have a good day when your morning begins with breakfast in the same room as Carrie Tiffany, David Vann and Lionel Shriver.","I always knew I wanted to be a writer. I just wasn't sure what I wanted to do as a money-making job."],"Hannah Marks":["I'm a vegetarian and change my hair color as much as I can.","I like a little bit of punk mixed with a little bit of feminine.","What I wear is constantly evolving. I am really big on comfortable clothes. I love soft, loose-fitting clothing that has some edge or something new/fresh to it.","Since I'm a vegetarian, I try to focus on getting my protein and iron needs met.","I don't concern myself too much about calories and fat."],"Hannah Mills":["Sport's hard: the margin between winning and losing is tiny.","Sailing is such a variable sport. There could be no wind, or there could be 25 knots. You never know what you're going to get.","I loved to do sports when I was young. We were on a family holiday and went sailing. I just loved it. And there, you can say, life began to change for me.","I deferred my third-year studies from university to go full time sailing to try and qualify for the 2012 London Olympics, which I did. I tried to go back to the university, but having won the silver medal, I just haven't been able to get back. And now I'm not sure if I ever will.","I'm scared of the water, and I hate the sea. I'd be all right if it was clear and I could see what was underneath. But it's the not knowing what's there that freaks me out.","I always dreamed of going to the Olympics. To be going to the Games in your own country is another thing; to do it as a potential medallist is another thing again.","I started sailing because I had to stop playing tennis so much, as I had bad knees.","You've got to be able to take the bad events with the good ones. You've got to learn to deal with them and learn to take as much as you can from those. Have fun and put as much as you can into it. As long as you've done your best, that's all you can do.","I like to relax a lot the night before a race. I like having people around me. I don't like being on my own, particularly. Music helps psych you up, too.","You can't just get in a boat with someone and be great straight away. It takes a lot of time to get used to each other. You need to learn how the other person reacts to certain situations."],"Hannah More":["Forgiveness is the economy of the heart... forgiveness saves the expense of anger, the cost of hatred, the waste of spirits.","If faith produce no works, I see That faith is not a living tree. Thus faith and works together grow, No separate life they never can know. They're soul and body, hand and heart, What God hath joined, let no man part.","Idleness among children, as among men, is the root of all evil, and leads to no other evil more certain than ill temper.","Goals help you overcome short-term problems.","Love never reasons, but profusely gives; it gives like a thoughtless prodigal its all, and then trembles least it has done to little.","Depart from discretion when it interferes with duty.","Genius without religion is only a lamp on the outer gate of a palace; it may serve to cast a gleam of light on those that are without, while the inhabitant sits in darkness.","Luxury! more perilous to youth than storms or quicksand, poverty or chains.","Going to the opera, like getting drunk, is a sin that carries its own punishment with it.","The wretch who digs the mine for bread, or ploughs, that others may be fed, feels less fatigued than that decreed to him who cannot think or read."],"Hannah Murray":["Turns out you have a really fun time if you go to work every day and focus on being silly and funny and happy!","I really loved animals when I was little - my friend and I had an imaginary vet's office; we would mime doing surgery on animals. We treated more injuries than illnesses - fixing with a baby bear with a broken leg, removing a tumor. Of course, our surgeries would take about five seconds; that's how good we were.","Do people ever ask me to say 'Wow?' Never in interviews, but a few times on the street. I don't do it. I try to get away from them as quickly as possible and explain that I'm not a performing seal.","I really hate being recognised. I'm quite a shy person, and I'm not very good at talking to strangers. So when people come up to me in the street, I just find it quite awkward. I don't really know what to say to them.","I really like singing, although I'm embarrassed about doing it.","I wonder if I maybe have a natural floatiness that comes through in everyone I play.","Was I in a nativity play? I think I was an angel; I was a very blonde child, so I tended to get typecast. I have a vague memory of wearing wings.","I really like all of the characters in 'The Secret History' by Donna Tartt, especially Camilla, the one girl. I find her fascinating.","You can tell when people think they're a little bit special, and it's quite fun to laugh at them, and I think it's good to laugh at them, because then you can deflate their egos a bit.","'Skins' is about a group of teenagers in Bristol, and it's all about what they get up to and all the different things they do. I think it's a good show because it's come from a very real place, and there's a lot of young people involved in the writing.","I can't think of any shows I've watched about teenagers that has the same spirit that 'Skins' has, the same honesty about it.","No one in my family is in entertainment. They thought acting was a fun hobby, and when I got a degree, I'd settle down.","I never, never lend any of my own clothes for parts any more because you lose your clothes; they become the characters' clothes, and you can never wear them again.","There are so many female roles - particularly for young women - that are just somebody's girlfriend or somebody's daughter, or that are accessories to the main story rather than being three-dimensional characters.","I don't think there's any show comparable to 'Game of Thrones' in terms of the way it does the fantasy element to such a high standard: everything is created with so much care and detail. You really feel like you are transported into this entirely other fictional place.","I've always loved musical films; I find them really thrilling and exciting; it was part of what made me want to be an actress, that feeling of being really transported.","I can remember on the first day on 'Chatroom,' it was just one scene for the whole day, which was a really nice luxury to have.","Cambridge is really understanding and helpful, so that's been good, and it's just a case of trying to get stuff done when I am there and just being efficient with managing my time.","One of the hardest things to do in acting is to stop thinking about yourself and stop being self-conscious.","On 'Chatroom,' everyone was so nice, and we had a really great time together; we were around the same age and got on really well.","Stuart Murdoch is a really special human being - really creative, but also really kind and gentle.","I'm not a trained singer at all. I've auditioned on occasion for proper musical theatre-type stuff, but I can't read music, and I wasn't particularly good at it."],"Hannah Simone":["Once you get a kitten, the natural thing you do is take a billion photos.","I move countries every three or four years. I was born in London, and we lived in Canada. Then we lived in Saudi Arabia until the Gulf War broke out, when we were forced to leave. Then we hop-scotched for a while from Holland back to Canada back to Saudi Arabia. Then there was D-day, so we had to get out again.","'Curvy' is just a polite way of saying 'fat.'","Think about it: if the world could see how much adoption means from a cat's point of view, shelters would be empty.","I love when I go back to London. I love how the girls dress there.","It comes down to personal style, and that's what's sexy and attractive in a man.","I think being called a cat lady is a compliment. It means you have adopted a tiny little maniac into your life.","I am a little obsessed with surprise kitty.","I have an extended family of close friends, guy and girls.","My mom used to call me a parrot, because the way I spoke would change in every country we'd go to.","When you're going through a breakup, you should just let yourself feel everything so you can get over it as opposed to pretending everything's okay and dragging it out.","Take risks! I'm embracing bold prints.","Everyone is your friend if you say yes, but say no and watch how they react. It's been a huge life lesson for me.","My lashes are so long that if I don't curl them, I'm blind.","As a girl growing up in Cyprus, Saudi Arabia and then India, the idea of cracking the industry in America seemed crazy. So thankfully, the way I was raised was to be an open person.","If I could travel back in time, I'd bring back the entire Wu-Tang Clan.","Millions of cats are in shelters across the country waiting for a loving parent or family to bring them home.","Physical intimacy is easy. Emotional intimacy is hard.","If you're not a workout person, go there 75 percent fast asleep. Anybody who has ever been in one of my workout classes knows I'm there practically in my pajamas!","It just seemed like an unattainable dream to go down to Los Angeles and to land a professional working, acting gig on a show that you really love with a character you really connect with. That doesn't seem possible; that seems insane.","I think everybody understands the fact that the right person will be cast for the role. So it's not theirs really to lose; they're just trying to find the right person.","My life is so crazy! I learned early on to really embrace change and enjoy the ride.","I also had a hosting position on a home and garden television show - which is a joke if you ever see my apartment.","Fusion fashion - that's what I'm inspired by, taking all these different cultures and then trying to put it together that a girl here would love to wear.","The first concert that my parents took me to was in this canyon in Saudi Arabia called Buttermilk Canyon. You sleep under the stars in the desert, and ex-pats - German, Swiss, Canadian, American - would play classical music that filled the whole canyon.","The thing I learned about being in this industry is the core of hosting and the core of acting is authenticity. So if you're just real in those moments, no matter what you're doing, that's what translates and makes you successful.","I've been on stage since I was nine years old, and I kind of stumbled into the world of hosting. That, to me, was the thing I had to build a skill set for.","My family never told me like you have to be one thing. What do you want to be when you grow up? They think it's the most ridiculous question. You can be many, many things.","I lived on the Greek side of Cypress, and I think that's also where my interest in politics really started to come alive. It was the first time that I was told I couldn't go somewhere: My grandfather's house is on the Turkish side, but we were not allowed to go there.","I had two different degrees: One in International Relations/Political Science and another degree in Radio and Television Production.","People know not to mess with my friends or my family because it's not going to work out well for you.","I got a job as a human rights and refugees officer, working on youth-based projects. But I realized all the kids I was working with were far more into 'The Daily Show' than the policy briefings.","I'm not afraid of change, let's put it that way.","While I was growing up all over, in all my different schools, I was always doing theater, auditioning for plays.","I am passionate about human rights.","You can't force chemistry. It's either there or it's not. You can't create it.","Often women are pitted against each other for an easy joke, so they fight or steal each other's boyfriends. That's not really true to life.","I've been on stage since I was eight.","We all have our strengths and our failings.","Flirting is funny. And it's awkward and weird.","It's funny, I was talking to somebody who writes for a cop show, and he was saying how they aren't allowed to acknowledge Christmas, Thanksgiving, Valentine's Day, just because it has to be able to play forever.","Most high-level models that I've ever met are actually well-travelled; they're cultured, and no guy laying a cheesy line on them is actually going to impact their world.","The Weeknd is the dopeness.","Live TV would terrify anybody.","I played ping-pong with Prince. That's pretty surreal. He gave me a lesson before we played; like, he's great. He's a master at it, so I took the free lesson.","I'm thrilled to partner with Gillette to help men understand what women want. If we're able to give them that information, and Gillette can give them the tools to get there, then we both win, and that's very exciting.","It's always exciting when you love something and you get the opportunity to share it with more people.","I dated someone in the '90s who was really into Metallica, and I remember thinking at the time, 'That just sounds so heavy and hard.' But they have great ballads! Great ballads.","The thing about dating someone who listens to a totally different genre than you is they can help you find things to appreciate in that genre.","I've never been on a date.","All of my relationships have happened organically with people who are super cool and in my life and it just moved into a relationship zone.","Working opposite Max Greenfield is the best job in the world. He's just incredible.","I feel like we can't pick who we fall in love with because if we could, we would all make better choices. Your heart just falls where it falls.","I guess there are all these women with a big secret - they're hiding men they are ashamed of. They come up to me and say: 'I've been dating this guy for six months in secret but none of my friends know. I can't give him up even though he's embarrassing.'","When I lived in India, I'd speak like an Indian to get good prices while shopping. I'm good with accents.","I went to Coachella once, and it was only to go see Leonard Cohen. I got in the car and sat through all the crazy traffic in L.A. to get there - instead of a two hour drive, it takes, like, six hours. Then I watched his set and turned around and left. I just so wanted to see him perform in the desert.","I remember the first time my friend Colin Lewis, who used to be a judge with me on a show on MuchMusic called 'disBAND,' told me, 'I think I just found your next favorite artist to adore.' He sent me The Weeknd, and he was completely spot on. The Weeknd is literally on every playlist I have.","When people tell really good stories in songs, I really like it.","When I lived in London, I worked three jobs and had such long work days.","The best place to live is where you are right now.","I grew up in Saudi Arabia and India and Cyprus, and I lived in a war-zone myself, and, I mean, I had a pretty bizarre, I guess, nomadic childhood, and so I was really drawn to international relations and political science.","I worked at the United Nations.","I was born in England, but then I lived in Calgary, Saudi Arabia, Cyprus, India, Vancouver, London, Toronto, and now L.A.","That's my family; we have a very British sense of humour, very dry.","I know quite a few friends who are models, and they're usually really smart, sharp, world-savvy people.","I love to do Pilates, Bar Method, and spin. I'm addicted.","An eyelash curler changes your entire face. It opens your eyes up.","Clinique's Chubby Stick Moisturizing Lip Colour Balm in Chunky Cherry is perfect for people with my skin tone.","Everything I've done I've always kind of jumped in headfirst, and it's been a learning curve. Even MuchMusic, I had never done live television before, and all of a sudden you show up, and they're like, 'You ready kid? Let's go.'","The Canadians kind of look out for each other a little bit.","You can spend the day at work, but when you go home, and you're in the role of a father or a husband, you don't have to remind yourself that you shouldn't tell your wife to hold the messages. If you do, that marriage is not going to last very long.","If you look at my career path, I was a human rights and refugees officer for the United Nations. I helped research a book for Lloyd Axworthy. I've worked in coffee shops. I've sold clothes. I've hosted TV shows, and now I'm acting.","We want to bring awareness for all those cats still searching for their forever home and not only help them find their perfect match but also make the transition home a success.","I love the funny and sweet moments I have with my cats, Jake and Frank, so I'm honored to be celebrating these moments at the Catdance Film Festival.","America's Next Shuffle Cat contest proved to be not only entertaining, but a rare chance for me to have an opportunity to host and judge some of the nation's cutest cats as they strutted the catwalk.","I should give a TED Talk about my TV-marathoning skills. It's my sport.","I'm a huge cook! I'm actually trying to write my first cookbook. I make an Indian-spice Bolognese and serve it over pasta. It's a combination of flavors that people aren't used to.","I went to high schools in four different countries. The gift is that you can constantly reinvent yourself. I still feel that freedom. One day, I'll wear a dress I got in India; the next, Converse sneakers and jeans.","That is the most liberating thing to feel as an actor: that you don't have to hold back or be afraid. A bit might not work, but it doesn't matter.","The hardest part of my job, daily, is to not laugh while we shoot.","I just can't break. If I break, I'm done. So I don't break.","The greatest thing about 'New Girl' is that you never can predict what is next!","My cats, Jacob and Frank, mean the world to me, and by partnering once again with Fresh Step with the power of Febreze, I'm raising awareness for its Million Meow Mission to help every shelter cat find a forever home.","Indian weddings, visually, they're so stunning.","If someone wants to take me on a date? I don't know if I'd say no.","That's so romantic, to wake up and find that he's packed a bag - and that for the next 48 hours, everything is taken care of.","I find there's this weird anger thing: Someone will approach me at the bar and say, 'Hey, can I buy you a drink?' And I'll say, 'No, I'm okay.' And then all of a sudden, there's this male anger flip, where they go, 'Oh, you know what? I wasn't even gonna buy you a drink, 'cause you're not even that cute anyway,' and walk away.","I would not give up my eyelash curler.","I think if you want to be seen as an intelligent woman, you can't be someone who feels empowered and sexy. I just don't understand who makes these rules, and frankly, I'm not interested in them.","It is so cool to think that there are two female, Indian actresses on prime-time American network television who are considered attractive and funny and smart.","I think eventually I'd love to get into directing.","I know that Liz Meriwether likes to keep things as honest and complicated as life can be, which is really fun for all of us.","After I graduated in Vancouver, I had been working on a book about war-affected children and land mines with the foreign minister - he was working at a place on campus and hired me. I then got a job as a Human Rights and Refugees Officer in London, and I loved working there.","I had never thought of hosting, but a really good friend of mine said, 'This is the most empowered platform to speak to young people about the issues that you care about, which is why you're in this in the first place.' So I was like, 'Yeah, no, it makes perfect sense.' And so that's what I started doing.","The things that I care about have never changed.","I'm obsessed with karaoke, but I don't like to sing. I just like to go and watch amateur singers.","The song that makes me the happiest when someone sings it is Cher's 'If I Could Turn Back Time.'","A friend of mine and I would go to this dirty little bar in Toronto that has karaoke every Tuesday night, and one night, we noticed that the only other person in there was Derek Jeter.","It's aspirational for me. I've lived as a cat lady. I'm happy to be a cat lady. I'll continue to be a cat lady. Just bring them all to my house, and I'll keep them all, no problem.","I'm just a really big fan of street style. When I went to New York for Fashion Week, it was great to watch everyone on the runway and see all the beautiful clothes and to get ideas, but again, I think it's just about being open and looking around.","My mom, well, she's half Greek, half German-Italian; born in England. She's just a nomad. She loves Middle Eastern style, Indian style, so much so that she ended up having Indian babies.","Women are no longer being defined by where they were born or their colour. That's huge.","Growing up, I remember watching TV, and I didn't see a lot of people who looked like me, especially someone who passed as a glamorous model on a mainstream TV show.","When I lived in London, I worked at the U.N. for a while as its human rights and refugees officer. I have two degrees, and my second was in radio. I was a programmer and news reporter in Canada. My CV looks bananas."],"Hannah Storm":["I've been out of my comfort zone a lot, and it makes me more vulnerable, but I have to draw the line somewhere, and don't think I would go skydiving!","People are much more loose if you are having fun. I had a basketball player who was really soft-spoken, and then we played Connect Four with him, and he really opened up!","I literally couldn't get anyone to hire me. Having a woman do sports was seen as too risky.","Despite his NFL pedigree, Clay Matthews had to fight every step of the way to get to the NFL. Once there, he's had a unique appreciation of what it took to succeed.","Secretary of State Colin Powell, thank you so much, as always, for joining us this morning.","I was in Charlotte, N.C., when they launched the NBA team there, the Charlotte Hornets. And the first guy to roll into town was Carolina native Michael Jordan.","I love my kitchen. On the weekends, we have friends over, the kids are buzzing around, and we cook and talk.","I was a huge ham in school in Atlanta.","ESPN is a very anchor-driven network, which I love.","The sports space is so full of opinion that you aren't hearing from the athletes just speaking for themselves. We are such a Twitter-oriented society with radio talk shows, TV talk shows and social media - what you are missing is the authentic, unfiltered aspect of who these people are.","Vin Scully has been my broadcasting idol for a long time. He is so humble - he has the exact same work ethic that he had 65 years ago. His family is what he cares about the most, and at the heart of his whole being is his marriage and kids.","My birthmark essentially looks like I have a black eye. It isn't that bad, so you can imagine if it has been this big a part of my life, think of what it must be like for children with more serious birthmarks that cover half their face.","As I got older, I became so self conscious about my birthmark that I was very hesitant about going to a pool party, because I didn't want my makeup to rub off.","If your child is born with a port-wine stain, they should be seen immediately by a pediatric dermatologist. Your pediatrician does not understand these birthmarks as well as a specialist.","Every burn on my body has had its own different personality. And all of them needed different things.","I believe in tackling things you're afraid of.","It's no surprise that I ended up in sportscasting. I lived this world with my father, Mike Storen. Dad was a sports executive for most of my childhood.","I loved the glamour and excitement of the games and, in particular, knowing the names of each and every one of the referees - that's because my mom, a former basketball player, would yell at them from our front-row seats for making bad calls!","My father's peripatetic career also gave me critical perspective when it came to my own career choices.","Even when I lost my job at CBS News, I set up shop in my youngest daughter's bedroom and started Brainstormin' Productions and the Hannah Storm Foundation. And guess who was there, visiting me and enthusiastically making business charts and graphs that covered my entire kitchen table? My dad, of course.","At key crossroads in his life, Vernon Davis has continued to make a conscious choice to grow as a person and player. His determination through adversity since his childhood days is commendable.","J.J. Watt is larger than life and Houston's newest sports hero, in every sense of the word. He is a guy who spends NFL Fridays at high school football games and actively seeks out those in need of his kindness."],"Hannah Teter":["Surfing waves of water or clouds of powder snow is the best feeling on earth.","Clean water is such a treasure that we take for granted in America.","I think people forget that it doesn't take a big donation to help someone, just a lot of little donations.","The earth is one big interconnected entity. If you hurt a piece, you hurt the whole. If you hurt the people, you hurt the environment.","Maple syrup makes you strong!","I love the whole layout of Vancouver and the super-friendly people who live there.","I made a pact with myself when I was younger that if were to ever grow up to be someone, I would be someone who would make a difference, instead of being just another person on the planet who doesn't look into anything.","When you surround yourself with nature, it's really powerful.","I'm moving into a yurt in the woods near my parents' home in Vermont.","The sun rays are more powerful at high altitudes and the snow bounces the rays right back up at you. Shiseido sun care products are epic for protecting me and not irritating my skin.","I feel like my role is to be one of those voices who reaches the youth.","I've been to three Olympics, and they're cool and everything, but I feel like people just aren't grateful for what we have and the opportunities we have.","Guys with bigger boobs than I have walk around, and they're fine. If women were to do that, they could go to jail. That's totally wrong.","Bodies are beautiful and should be appreciated.","I'm OK with people being naked. There shouldn't be a huge deal made about it.","Once I get my mind set on something, I want to see it succeed at the highest level.","Sometimes, you need to revamp yourself over the winter, participate in things that make you appreciate what you have.","I want to make money for third-world-country kids, and I need to be smart about how to do it.","I'd just like to see athletes awake. And aware. There's so much going on and so much to know... We stay in our little boxes and don't think much about the outside world.","I snowboard because I love it. It's just a cool way to be out there and doing something different instead of going to college.","My plant-based diet has opened up more doors to being an athlete. It's a whole other level that I'm elevating to.","I'm into fashion and designing clothes and stuff.","I use products with coconut oil in them all over my skin.","I use Jane Iredale SPF foundation and bronzer, along with the brand's brushes. Her stuff keeps my face all glowy and looking good for interviews and moments when I want to feel like a million bucks.","Young Living Peace & Calming Essential Oil is one of my favorite oil blends. I have many of them but choose this one for my neck and wrists most often.","I love stir-fries, quinoa, tofu, and tempeh!","Putin is very - not the smartest guy in the world.","Usually, boycotts sometimes don't really accomplish anything besides the fact that you show you that don't agree with what's going on.","That's what snowboarders do: we break rules.","I don't overcook, because you lose what's good in the food.","I'm motivated to keep going to keep making a difference in people's lives.","Funny how one halfpipe run can change your life.","I've been striving for attention my whole life. Now I have it.","Shaun White and Danny Kass were obsessed with trading Olympic pins. I bet they can say 'pin' in every language.","Fourth is the worst position to finish. You just missed the podium.","My goal from the beginning was, if I ever hit it it big, I would give back. And that continues to be my goal moving forward.","Growing up with four older brothers, we were into everything! They started snowboarding when I was just a tiny button, and I loved watching them shredding in the backyard. After seeing them compete in a few contests, it was all over. I idolized the sport from day one.","I come from a close-knit family, and I have four older brothers that have inspired me in so many ways.","I hope that as a professional snowboarder, Olympian, and now, a Global Ambassador for Special Olympics, I will be able to change perceptions about people with intellectual disabilities.","The Special Olympics motto, 'Let me win, but if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt,' really speaks to me because it embodies exactly what I have pursued in my life. Really, that's all any of us can hope for - a chance to be brave and to pursue a dream.","I have been so inspired by the Special Olympics athletes that I have been so fortunate to meet, and I am excited to continue my involvement in the Special Olympics Movement.","I've always felt really lucky and really privileged with my life, how I grew up, and the opportunities I've had.","I've always wanted to make an impact.","You don't really get the full grasp of something until you see it for yourself.","Every human life is worth so much.","I decided I want to represent the U.S. and show what snowboarding's all about.","I grew up in Vermont, so we didn't really have a TV, growing up, or a football team.","I didn't know football was so big. Obviously, it's huge in the United States.","I've been blessed to have enough to buy organic and have a house in Tahoe.","I love riding halfpipe. This is an amazing job to have.","It was a no-brainer to get the Unified snowboarding race into X Games.","When I discovered Special Olympics and saw how it integrates these athletes into programs that change the whole way they see themselves and how they perform, it blew my mind. I wanted to be involved.","The Unified races are so much fun and take you back to the roots of why you started snowboarding. It makes you feel grateful for all that you have.","When I see somebody fall in practice or get hurt, it almost makes me want to cry.","I'm trying to do more inverts and corked-out rotations that you don't see at the girls' level. I want to be more creative.","You want everybody to see snowboarding as it should be, looking phenomenal with everybody doing what they know how to do.","When the Olympics comes around, it seems like every country is against each other, but we're all buddies out here. It's about giving feedback to fellow riders and letting the riders feed off each other.","Riding is my passion, but a very close second is sun, sand, and surf.","The concept of bettering yourself at the disadvantage of others is out the door, and the new one is to help one another while helping yourself.","Snowboarding is about having fun, pushing one another creatively, and not putting anyone down along the way.","I still want to look good while training hard and throwing down.","Americans are pretty next level with snowboarding. We have the best training facilities, the best coaches that push us to the next level.","It seems like an obligation if you have it so good. You have to spread the wealth.","Action sports is just in a new era: thinking outside the box, being creative, and inventing new things. I just think people dig that. It's a new way of being an athlete.","It's great to have the opportunity to reach out to people that don't know much about snowboarding so they can see it and get stoked on it.","I am a huge fan of quinoa, not only for its health benefits but because it tastes the best out of all the grains.","I try to incorporate quinoa in unique and fun ways into most meals.","I am thrilled to be working with Shiseido and to be representing their incredible suncare, skincare, and makeup lines.","Beauty, to me, is about being healthy and strong, both physically and mentally, and Shiseido products arm me with the protection and style I need.","I grew up with a special-needs brother, and the separation from other kids is so extreme. We've got to break down those barriers.","Children International is bringing a lot of hope to families who start out with nothing. They have nothing. Then Children International comes in, puts them in school, gets them what they need.","I always get super stoked to go to the Open, because it's in my home state. I get to stay in my parents' house and get to eat pancakes.","It's so hard to see one of your friends fall, and it's a reminder that you have to be on and in the zone."],"Hannah Tointon":["I did feel pressure to look a certain way on 'Hollyoaks.' But I just had to stay strong and not let myself get into a state of mind that isn't healthy.","Every girl has days when she doesn't like her appearance, but it's when you feel happy in yourself that you look good.","To be honest, I am somebody that, as long as I have a character, it doesn't really matter if it's comedy or drama - I think timing is important in either. But for me, it's all about having a character to work on.","I'm never going to be a size zero and, to be honest I don't want to be."],"Hannah Ware":["I love the sense of how time passes when I'm acting. When you're not aware of the clock ticking, that is always a good sign you're enjoying something.","My sister, singer Jessie Ware, and I are always exchanging music. We brainstormed her wedding playlist for months.","My mum made me feel if I wanted to become prime minister, I could do it.","I think all girls secretly want to be actresses because acting seems so glamorous. But as a child, I was always the villager who had one line in the school play. I was shy and I had a bit of a lisp.","Something like your parents divorcing never quite leaves you. What you thought was real isn't real anymore, and that changes your perspective. It makes you more wary but also means you are better equipped to deal with challenges.","Growing up in South London, we went to a school where there were not that many Jewish kids. I love being Jewish in L.A.; it feels really normal. The culture seems to be integrated into Hollywood. Everyone uses Yiddish words like 'schlep' and 'schmooze.' That's what I love about New York, too.","I am a failed architect, if I'm honest. I got a degree in art history and was about to get another degree, in architecture, but realized I would be terrible at building things because I've got really bad spatial awareness.","I was embarrassed about modeling. When you're at school and you're modeling, it sounds very glamorous, but I didn't want to do things that no one else was doing. I didn't want to be the odd one out. I wanted to be part of the gang.","I'm not on Twitter or Facebook. I've never been interested in being on any of them. I don't know why I'm not. I just don't have that need. I feel like I'm one of the only people I know who doesn't do it.","My sister's a singer, and she's on Twitter, and she has millions of followers. I wonder how that helps her. I think it does to an extent. I think she gets free things.","I was 26 when I went to my first acting class. I'm naturally quite shy. I'm a quite private person. There's this really strange acting class in New York called Black Nexxus. For someone who's slightly shy or self-conscious, it's the most frightening thing you can do.","I think part of what acting did for me is it kind of represents all my greatest fears. I'm sort of compelled to do it, but at the same time, it's so frightening. But I think that the things that frighten me the most in life are the things I should be doing.","'Mixtape' sounds retro! I used to make lots of mixed tapes. It was one of those '90s things - every girl gave them to her best friend. I remember exchanging a few with a boy on a bus when I was 14. I thought he hated me, but in hindsight, maybe he was in love with me, because he gave me the best music.","We did a lot of fight scenes in 'Hitman: Agent 47,' so you have to learn repetitious movements to music; otherwise, it's amazingly boring. Michael Jackson was our savior."],"Hanneli Mustaparta":["I think its important to start the day with a proper breakfast.","I have always found photography magical, and became more taken with it whilst modeling.","Never blog just to put something out there. I would post only things that excite me.","I'm not afraid of problem-solving. There is always a way.","Being behind the lens gives me a completely different perspective, and because of my blog, I get to do projects and attend shows lending me another angle.","I'm self-taught and emailed photographers I knew if I had questions I couldn't figure out from the manual or online.","I see the Calvin Klein girl as strong, fun, and confident.","I just work hard and do things as they come along. But it has been a challenge to learn that I have to say 'no' to things and to know how and what to prioritize.","I have my own voice and can focus only on that. I know what I like; I find my inspirations in so many other places than just online and bring that into my work."],"Hannes Alfven":["Most people today still believe, perhaps unconsciously, in the heliocentric universe every newspaper in the land has a section on astrology, yet few have anything at all on astronomy.","We should remember that there was once a discipline called natural philosophy. Unfortunately, this discipline seems not to exist today. It has been renamed science, but science of today is in danger of losing much of the natural philosophy aspect.","There is no rational reason to doubt that the universe has existed indefinitely, for an infinite time. It is only myth that attempts to say how the universe came to be, either four thousand or twenty billion years ago.","We have to learn again that science without contact with experiments is an enterprise which is likely to go completely astray into imaginary conjecture.","I have always believed that astrophysics should be the extrapolation of laboratory physics, that we must begin from the present universe and work our way backward to progressively more remote and uncertain epochs.","To try to write a grand cosmical drama leads necessarily to myth. To try to let knowledge substitute ignorance in increasingly larger regions of space and time is science."],"Hannibal Buress":["When people go through something rough in life, they say, 'I'm taking it one day at a time.' Yes, so is everybody. Because that's how time works.","Once you're in a room like '30 Rock,' it's a creative setting, so you write more even after you go home, just because you're still in that mode of coming up with jokes. So the job wasn't sapping standup jokes, but it was sapping stand up time and energy, and I wouldn't be able to travel as much.","Every guy should own one good pair of jeans.","For me... you know, the most I've paid for a haircut was in Australia. Usually I go to a black barber or a Latino barber. I can't just go into Supercuts.","There's been times where I sold the place out, and I walked in and the guy's like, 'Uh, ID?' 'No, you can't ID me, man. I just sold this place out.' People are just doing their jobs, but I think if you're working the door at a venue where there's a headliner, you should at least be like, 'OK, this is the dude.'","If I ever have downtime, I'm usually sitting in my place playing video games. Or eating sandwiches somewhere, or watching sports some place.","I think one of my first jokes - in the black community, there's people who have jokes about skin tone. People like, 'You so black, you purple.' 'You so black, you gotta smile so we can see you at night.'","When people say, 'How did you start in comedy,' I say my family was kidnapped by ninjas when I was very young, and to get them released I had to do a killer five-minute set. And even after I did that, you know, I started doing comedy under tough circumstances, I still kept at it because I enjoyed it.","I'm in awful shape. I'm trying to get in better shape. My girlfriend, she's in good shape. She gives me health tips sometimes, like, 'Hannibal, you're going to die.' Stuff like that.","My second year of college, I started performing comedy at an open mic. It was good to do open mics with the kids. It's a good, safe spot to start, you know?","In my hometown of Chicago, I'm kind of a medium deal.","I took an improv class in 2005 in Chicago at ComedySportz, which was short-form, more of a games-based improv. I remember it being real fun and helping with my stand-up. If I did an improv class, and then I did stand-up later, I felt looser on stage and more comfortable.","Social media is interesting. It helps me connect with fans. It's immediate. It's a big part of my touring business - getting the word out via Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.","I really like Halal food.","I'd like to get more bit-acting roles. I don't know if my talent would allow for a long dialogue, but I could definitely knock out three lines. I'd kill it.","I used to have costumed characters come out, like SpongeBob. It's just fun to make it into this minor event, just to surprise people and experiment and be weird and just have fun with it. I've done just the hour stand-up, and that's fun, but the other stuff makes it fun for me and gives me something to react to and bounce off of.","I'm doin' something different. I mean, I talk a little bit about race and interracial dating, but it's not the heart of my act. I just try to do what I think is funny; there's no huge message or through line.","I like that Barack got that job.","I like getting 'Times' articles online. But the actual paper just has too many words.","I need to have something else going on. I'm able to write a lot if I have an episode of 'Friday Night Lights' going on my computer.","I just write and do what I think is funny. Sometimes, you do have it in your head about certain bits. There are certain jokes where I know if I did them in certain situations, it would irk people. There are times where I look at the news and see a story going on, and I'm like, 'Wow, if I tweeted this, I would get press if I wanted to.'","'Inside Out' - that was a really good movie. That's the first animated movie I saw since 'The Lego Movie.'","My dad named me after Hannibal Barca, the Carthaginian general who attacked Rome. But nobody knows about him.","I did not move to New York with a plan. The first time I moved to New York, I just popped up. My sister was living here in New York. I just popped up. She had her baby and a husband, and I just popped up. 'Hey, what's up? I got $200 and dreams. Let's do this.'","People like to compare something to something that they know. Even with Chris Rock, they say he's like Richard Pryor or Eddie Murphy.","'SNL' is the first real job I've held for more than a month and a half.","With sitcom writing, you're trying to write stories.","I skipped kindergarten because I was reading at a pretty high level. That's a weird and cocky thing to say, but I was real sharp, and I knew that early on.","The ultimate thing is creating your own stuff and making projects for yourself. That's what Seth Rogen does. He's writing and producing a lot of the movies that he's the lead in.","I remember 'Def Comedy Jam' being a big deal and kids talking about it in school, but it was never, 'I want to do that.'","Comedy is basically self-deprecation.","I had a sketch called 'Fedora Basketball,' which was about basketball players having to wear hats; in addition to scoring points, they have to make sure their fedoras don't fall off.","I can work as a writer, but I wanted to do stand-up.","I haven't really tried to write a movie. It's tough to get into that mode.","Gibberish rap is - I freestyle all the time, just hangin' out with friends. And sometimes when I'm freestyling, I'll lose my flow, you know, but I'll still wanna - I don't wanna just stop rapping because I lose my flow. So I'll just put in nonsense words till I can bring in regular words again.","I go to a lot of rap shows and sometimes take what they do from a performer's aspect, how they interact with the crowd. I always have a DJ with me on the road, as well as some dancers.","I could maybe coach kids' basketball. I know enough about basketball where I feel like I could coach 12-year-olds pretty effectively.","Actors, you have to wait for people to give you work, or you have to make your own stuff. But standup, I could just say, 'I want to do standup in 30 minutes,' and I can go do standup. Or I could just say, 'I want to do standup in a few weeks in this city.'","Even on TV appearances or big shows, I don't know if I've ever been as nervous as I was my first time doing stand-up. I just remember getting offstage and sitting down, and my right knee was just shaking from the adrenaline.","My first time on TV doing stand-up, I actually did this show in Holland called 'The Comedy Factory' hosted by Jorgen Raymann. It was in 2006 in Holland. It was amazing. I had only been doing stand-up for four years, and I booked that gig through the Just For Laughs Montreal festival, and they flew me out and put me up.","I didn't audition for 'SNL.' I sent in a tape to 'SNL' the year before I started writing there, but I got the job there through doing stand-up on Fallon.","I did a 'Last Comic Standing' audition in 2006, where you're just performing for three people in a comedy club, in a big comedy club, and I remember them cutting me off, asking about my name in the middle of one of my jokes. Yeah, it's just real weird when you're doing stand-up in that type of sterile, unnatural setting.","I think people overplay the 'Saturday Night Live' schedule. I mean, yeah, it can be some late hours. But the late hours are usually only one or two nights out of the week. You might have a crazy six-day week, but you'll work three weeks, and then you get a week off work. I'd take most jobs if it was hard work and then I got a week off.","You forget that sometimes comedy is just a big night out for people. Almost every show, people come up to me and go, 'This is the first comedy show I've ever seen,' so you want to do well. If you do horribly at somebody's first time seeing live stand-up, well, you've not only tainted yourself, you've tainted a whole art form.","I like to drive nice cars; since I live in New York, and I don't drive there, it's a novelty to be on the road and drive and listen to my music.","I don't know if I have a 'Greatest Album Ever.' I really liked 'The Blueprint' by Jay-Z. The production on that album was really great. 'All I Need' was the first song I used for walk-on music in 2002 for my second time ever on stage, so that means a lot to me.","I'd like to be remembered as good person and as one of the best comedians of my generation.","I don't argue with people... if they say I'm not funny, they're right, for them.","I think it's a tough transition. It's easy to go from comedian to rapper, but to go from rapper to comedian is tougher.","I don't like to post fresh standup material, because I want to use it in a special. The stuff I like to post online I like to be off-the-cuff moments.","I don't seek out love or relationships, just because my schedule is crazy.","Before I did comedy, I'd freestyle with all of my friends. In high school and into college, I recorded songs with my friends, not to perform but just to play for them. So I've had interest in music for a while. Early on, I'd host a lot of music open nights or hip-hop nights, so a lot of my early experience performing was around music.","I just wear black and gray all the time. If you Google Image me, you'll just see a bunch of black and gray. It's simple. If I like a shirt, I'll buy six or eight of them, wear them back-to-back, and just wait for somebody to say something. 'That's the same shirt you wore yesterday.' 'Yeah, but this one is fresh.'","Carbondale, Ill. is where I went to college, and it's where I first started putting on shows.","'SNL' doesn't have a traditional writer's room. On Monday, there's the pitch meeting with the guest, and I played that like it was stand-up.","A lot of comedians do bits where they say, 'I was listening to this song, and this person said this, and you know how they say that?' And I thought it would work better if I actually had a DJ put that song lyric right there. It makes it more dynamic, and it's more energetic.","I never have written a movie, but there are some bad movies out there. I can make one. I definitely want to get into that because that's how you, at my level, would get a lead in a movie - by writing a low budget thing for myself. So I gotta get to it.","Dave Chappelle is one of my comedic inspirations. His perspective is crazy, and he's super sharp.","In the future, I want to do an action movie! I'm going to get in shape, get ripped, and have my Chris Pratt transformation. And then become a movie star like that."],"Hanns Eisler":["A composer knows that music is written by human beings for human beings and that music is a continuation of life, not something separated from it.","Someone who knows only music, understands nothing about it."],"Hanoi Hannah":["I am happy with what I've done.","Nothing is more confused than to be ordered into a war to die or to be maimed for life without the faintest idea of what's going on.","We advised them to do what they think proper against the war.","American GIs don't fight this unjust immoral and illegal war of Johnson's.","This is the voice of Vietnam Broadcasting from Hanoi, capitol of the Democratic republic of Vietnam.","Our program for American GIs can be heard at 1630 hours.","It wasn't a new idea. During the war against the French we had this kind of broadcast for the French soldiers.","Because the GIs were sent massively to South Vietnam, maybe it's a good idea to have a broadcast for them.","We asked Jane Fonda if she would like to meet American pilots in Hanoi, but she refused, she didn't want to.","And we broadcast tapes sent to us from Americans against the war. These were most effective I believe.","Americans are xenophobic, they will believe their own people rather than the adversary, even a friendly enemy voice.","I put my heart in my work.","And we also read Newsweek, Time and several newspapers.","Well, we think the broadcasts did have some effect, because we see the antiwar movement in the U.S. building up, growing and so we think that our broadcast is a support to this antiwar movement.","There's a policy now of opening the doors to the outside world.","Because our fight has been for such a long time we are isolated from the world, even after reconstruction we don't have much attention from people outside.","I would like to see America some day.","I have always compared our traditions of liberty, like those of Abraham Lincoln and Ho Chi Minh.","I had to do something for the country.","Sometimes my colleagues joke and call me Hannah."],"Hans Adolf Krebs":["In the course of the 1920s and 1930s, great progress was made in the study of the intermediary reactions by which sugar is anaerobically fermented to lactic acid or to ethanol and carbon dioxide.","The research I have been doing - studying how foodstuffs yield energy in living cells - does not lead to the kind of knowledge that can be expected to give immediate practical benefits to mankind. If I have chosen this field of study, it was because I believed in its importance in spite of its theoretical character.","The concept of evolution postulates that living organisms have common roots, and in turn, the existence of common features is powerful support for the concept of evolution.","The existence of common features in different forms of life indicates some relationship between the different organisms, and according to the concept of evolution, these relations stem from the circumstance that the higher organisms, in the course of millions of years, have gradually evolved from simpler ones."],"Hans Bender":["Free yourself from the rigid conduct of tradition and open yourself to the new forms of probability.","PLease, do not visualize that we exist above you such as in heaven. The concepts above and below are products of your mind. The soul does not swing upwards. It exists in the center and orients itself in every direction.","Things you create with your mind are always part of your postmortal life, whether they seem real or not.","Because of the many dimensions of forms of though which you can also put into physical form, you have the possibility to create much which we cannot fashion in the same manner.","You shall always find what you created in your mind, for instance, a benevolent God or an evil Devil. Between them are countless facets. Therefore, concentrate on the depth of your consciousness and on what you consider to be positive and good.","Good and evil do not exist for me any more. The fear of evil is merely a mass projection here and on Earth.","The core of my personality consists of many selves.","The forms of my awareness are richer than yours."],"Hans Berger":["In Germany I am not so famous.","The electroencephalogram represents a continuous curve with continuous oscillations in which... one can distinguish larger first order waves with an average duration of 90 milliseconds and smaller second order waves of an average duration of 35 milliseconds.","We see in the electroencephalogram a concomitant phenomenon of the continuous nerve processes which take place in the brain, exactly as the electrocardiogram represents a concomitant phenomenon of the contractions of the individual segments of the heart."],"Hans Blix":["International cooperation, multilateralism is indispensable.","But I would say if the Security Council is only relevant if it agrees with the United States, then we have come a long way in a direction that I do not like very much.","What surprises me, what amazes me, is that it seems the military people were expecting to stumble on large quantities of gas, chemical weapons and biological weapons.","If public opinion still endorses military action that's one thing, but if they wait maybe it will not. So it's not only impatience, but there are several other factors.","I found it peculiar that those who wanted to take military action could - with 100 per cent certainty - know that the weapons existed and turn out to have zero knowledge of where they were.","You never get quite down to the bottom of the barrel, but we are much higher than that at the present time. There is quite a lot left in the barrel that could be explained by them. If they have some weapons, if they have some anthrax, they should deliver that.","They have been saying for a long time that Iraq made an effort to import active uranium, and my colleague demonstrated the other day that they came to the conclusion that it was a fake document that everybody is relying upon.","The world has gotten so interwoven.","The U.N. is much more than the case of Iraq.","The South Africans decided that they would like to prove to the world they did not have any nuclear weapons and their decision was not doubted because it was the end of the Cold War, it was also the end of apartheid.","The Iraqis are not threatened by the Turks or by the Iranians or by the Saudis and they tell me that these are not weapons of mass destruction, they are weapons of self-destruction.","The inspections started in 1991, right after the Gulf War. One of the conditions for the ceasefire was that Iraq had to do away with all of its weapons of mass destruction - biological, chemical and nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.","The country is not a democratic state. Therefore we fear that they might carry a recorder in their pocket or there may be bugs in the walls, and you cannot be absolutely sure that you get a straight testimony.","So interviews are a valuable tool, but under certain circumstances they'd be more valuable than others.","On big issues like war in Iraq, but in many other issues they simply must be multilateral. There's no other way around. You have the instances like the global warming convention, the Kyoto protocol, when the U.S. went its own way.","Now the idea about taking people abroad is that if they come over to Cyprus, which we have in mind, and bring their families and would have the possibility to defect after they would be ready to speak their mind, well I hope so.","Look at the Palestinians with the huge, huge percentage of unemployed. What does that breed? Anyone who's unemployed in the world, you feel there's no meaning and there's a risk that you drift over to something desperate. Yes, we have to tackle the social problems as well.","Like I said, I'm more worried long term about the environmental issues then the use of arms.","It was to do with information management. The intention was to dramatise it.","Iraq did not spontaneously opt for disarmament. They did it as part of a ceasefire, so they were forced to do it, otherwise the war might have gone on. So the motivation has been very different.","If you take the biological weapons in the United States we still will have perhaps a single individual who was able to make anthrax, dry it, and spread it through the mail and cause terror.","I think that we have to do our job well, investigate thoroughly and then describe very honestly what we see to the Security Council. And some of the things might please people there and other things may not please the people.","I don't think that anyone seriously fears that the world can be blown to pieces all together. But what one can fear and rightly so are regional things, like in the Middle East, India, Pakistan, the Korean Peninsula, borders in Africa, etc.","I can imagine that the Iraqis undertake the destruction out of fear. If they had denied it, if they had said no, that certainly would have played into the hands of those that would like to take armed action immediately. I have no illusions in that regard.","I also hear your president say that war is the means of last resort and I think he means that. I met him last autumn and he assured me that they wanted to come through and disarm Iraq by peaceful means, and that's what we are trying to do as hard as we can.","Even on television, the wavelengths that you use, they have to be distributed between countries.","By and large my relations with the US were good."],"Hans Christian Andersen":["Just living is not enough... one must have sunshine, freedom, and a little flower.","Where words fail, music speaks.","Life itself is the most wonderful fairy tale.","Every man's life is a fairy tale written by God's fingers.","My life is a lovely story, happy and full of incident.","Travelling expands the mind rarely.","Being born in a duck yard does not matter, if only you are hatched from a swan's egg.","Most of the people who will walk after me will be children, so make the beat keep time with short steps."],"Hans Eysenck":["Tact and diplomacy are fine in international relations, in politics, perhaps even in business; in science only one thing matters, and that is the facts.","In general, certain conclusions are possible from these data. They fail to prove that psychotherapy, Freudian or otherwise, facilitates the recovery of neurotic patients.","In our tabulation of psychoanalytic results, we have classed those who stopped treatment together with those not improved. This appears to be reasonable; a patient who fails to finish his treatment, and is not improved, is surely a therapeutic failure.","If the truth contradicts deeply held beliefs, that is too bad.","They show that roughly two-thirds of a group of neurotic patients will recover or improve to a marked extent within about two years of the onset of their illness, whether they are treated by means of psychotherapy or not.","There thus appears to be an inverse correlation between recovery and psychotherapy; the more psychotherapy, the smaller the recovery rate.","I always felt that a scientist owes the world only one thing, and that is the truth as he sees it."],"Hans Fischer":["In cases of porphyria, a minor disease, the patient excretes large quantities of porphyrins.","The blood pigment haemoglobin is a compound which can be split by diverse methods into its constituents, pigment and protein.","Coproporphyrin in particular is widespread; traces are present in normal urine and also in yeast. In special cultures, yeast can be made to produce considerable quantities of coproporphyrin.","If we introduce iron complexly into ooporphyrin, we obtain haemin."],"Hans Frank":["It was my dream, and probably the dream of every one of us, to bring about a revision of the Versailles Treaty by peaceful means, which was provided for in that very treaty.","The SS, as such, behaved no more criminally than any other social groups would behave when taking part in political events.","Concentration camps were entirely a matter for the police and had nothing to do with the administration.","I dealt with legal questions in the interest of Adolf Hitler and the NSDAP and its members during the difficult years of struggle for the victory of the Movement.","A thousand years will pass and the guilt of Germany will not be erased.","First, I was Bavarian State Minister of Justice, and after the ministries of justice in the various states were dissolved I became Reich Minister without portfolio.","I never participated in far-reaching political decisions, since I never belonged to the circle of the closest associates of Adolf Hitler, neither was I consulted by Adolf Hitler on general political questions, nor did I ever take part in conferences about such problems.","An administration without a police executive is powerless and there were many proofs of this.","I did not destroy the 43 volumes of my diary, which report on all these events and the share I had in them; but of my own accord I handed them voluntarily to the officers of the American Army who arrested me.","I worked as a lawyer; as a member of the teaching staff of a technical college; and then I worked principally as legal adviser to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers Party.","In 1930 I became a member of the Reichstag.","In my own sphere I did everything that could possibly be expected of a man who believes in the greatness of his people and who is filled with fanaticism for the greatness of his country, in order to bring about the victory of Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist movement.","In the main the Academy helped to frame only laws of an economic or social nature, since owing to the development of the totalitarian regime it became more and more impossible to cooperate in other spheres.","It was also my idea that the advisory committees of the Academy should replace the legal committees of the German Reichstag, which was gradually fading into the background in the Reich.","My aim was to safeguard justice, without doing harm to our war effort.","My first endeavor was to save the core of the German system of justice: the independent judiciary.","Ninety percent of the members of the Academy of German Law were not members of the Party.","On 24 August 1939, as an officer in the reserve, I had to join my regiment in Potsdam.","The police officers, so far as discipline, organization, pay, and orders were concerned, came exclusively under the German Reich police system and were in no way connected with the administration of the Government General.","War is not a thing one wants."],"Hans Haacke":["Museums are managers of consciousness. They give us an interpretation of history, of how to view the world and locate ourselves in it. They are, if you want to put it in positive terms, great educational institutions. If you want to put it in negative terms, they are propaganda machines.","There was an exhibition in Munich in 1937, 'Degenerate Art,' which included work by Klee, Kandinsky, Beckmann and many others. The work was called 'sick' and put in the trash heap. The sentiments expressed toward contemporary art by Jesse Helms, Pat Robertson and Mayor Giuliani recall the language used by the Nazis.","When works of art are presented like rare butterflies on the walls, they're decontextualized. We admire their beauty, and I have nothing against that, per se. But there is more to art than that.","A standard line, promoted by people like Clement Greenberg, is that politics contaminates art, and Manet is often cited as an example of art for art's sake.","A liberal public is interesting to have as an audience. It is for that very reason that corporations make such an effort to ally themselves with cultural institutions.","I have a particular interest in corporations that give themselves a cultural aura and are in other areas suspect. Philip Morris presents itself in New York as the lover of culture while it turns out that if you look behind the scenes, it is also a prime funder of Jesse Helms, someone who is very hostile to the arts.","Artists and art institutions have to learn how to play hardball. A democratic society needs a democratic art and we have a right to demand it.","Museums are not normally presenting the works on the walls as provocations to work. It's more like going to a Jacuzzi.","Trivializing the Holocaust is the last thing I want to do.","What I'm very upset about is the attempt to dictate to museums what they show, and the statements made by politicians in Washington that have curtailed the freedom of the National Endowment for the Arts. The attention to those issues is deflected by the spin of my supposedly having trivialized the Holocaust."],"Hans Hofmann":["In nature, light creates the color. In the picture, color creates the light.","The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak.","Colors must fit together as pieces in a puzzle or cogs in a wheel.","A work of art is a world in itself reflecting senses and emotions of the artist's world.","What goes on in abstract art is the proclaiming of aesthetic principles... It is in our own time that we have become aware of pure aesthetic considerations. Art never can be imitation.","Through a painting we can see the whole world.","It is not the form that dictates the color, but the color that brings out the form.","When the impulses which stir us to profound emotion are integrated with the medium of expression, every interview of the soul may become art. This is contingent upon mastery of the medium.","The whole world, as we experience it visually, comes to us through the mystic realm of color.","Every art expression is rooted fundamentally in the personality and temperament of the artist.","Art is to me the glorification of the human spirit, and as such it is the cultural documentation of the time in which it is produced.","My aim in painting is to create pulsating, luminous, and open surfaces that emanate a mystic light, in accordance with my deepest insight into the experience of life and nature.","Color is a plastic means of creating intervals... color harmonics produced by special relationships, or tensions. We differentiate now between formal tensions and color tensions, just as we differentiate in music between counterpoint and harmony.","Painters must speak through paint, not through words.","It makes no difference whether a work is naturalistic or abstract; every visual expression follows the same fundamental laws.","Being inexhaustible, life and nature are a constant stimulus for a creative mind.","To worship the product and ignore its development leads to dilettantism and reaction.","Art cannot result from sophisticated, frivolous, or superficial effects.","Art is magic... But how is it magic? In its metaphysical development? Or does some final transformation culminate in a magic reality? In truth, the latter is impossible without the former. If creation is not magic, the outcome cannot be magic.","An idea can only be materialized with the help of a medium of expression, the inherent qualities of which must be surely sensed and understood in order to become the carrier of an idea.","Creation is dominated by three absolutely different factors: First, nature, which works upon us by its laws; second, the artist, who creates a spiritual contact with nature and his materials; third, the medium of expression through which the artist translates his inner world.","The art of pictorial creation is so complicated - it is so astronomical in its possibilities of relation and combination that it would take an act of super-human concentration to explain the final realization."],"Hans Jonas":["The latest revelation - from no Mount Sinai, Sermon on the Mount or Bo tree - is the outcry of mute things themselves that we must heed by curbing our powers over creation, lest we perish together on a wasteland of what that creation once was.","Act so that the effects of your actions are compatible with the permanence of genuine human life.","Responsibility has become the fundamental imperative in modern civilization, and it should be an unavoidable criterion to assess and evaluate human actions, including, in a special way, development activities.","That nature does not care, one way or the other, is the true abyss. That only man cares, in his finitude facing nothing but death, alone with his contingency and the objective meaninglessness of his projecting meanings, is a truly unprecedented situation.","As to each of us, the knowledge that we are here but briefly and a nonnegotiable limit is set to our expected time may even be necessary as the incentive to number our days and make them count.","Only a completely unintelligible God can be said to be absolutely good and absolutely powerful yet tolerate the world as it is.","It is a changing world because of the newcomers who keep arriving and who leave us behind. Trying to keep pace with them is doomed to inglorious failure, especially as the pace has quickened so much.","Judaism and Christianity in themselves are distinctly separate entities, to be sure; but when considering their influence on Western thought, we must bear in mind that Christianity alone, or almost alone, transmitted the Jewish share, simply by what it contained of it in its own, original constitution.","It was once religion which told us that we are all sinners because of original sin. It is now the ecology of our planet which pronounces us all to be sinners because of the excessive exploits of human inventiveness.","It was once religion which threatened us with a last judgment at the end of days. It is now our tortured planet which predicts the arrival of such a day without any heavenly intervention.","Never must the existence or the essence of man as a whole be made a stake in the hazards of action.","To me, it was a sad fate to have been born into a period and a world where everything was in tip-top order, and the only real excitement was to be found in history books and occasionally also in the paper.","Being, in the testimony it gives of itself, informs us not only about what it is but also about what we owe it.","Modern theory is about objects lower than man; even stars, being common things, are lower than man.","For a scientific theory of him to be possible, man, including his habits of valuation, has to be taken as determined by causal laws, as an instance and part of nature.","The simple truth of our finiteness is that we could, by whatever means, go on interminably only at the price of either losing the past and, therewith, our identity, or living only in the past and therefore without a real present. We cannot seriously wish either and thus not a physical enduring at that price.","Our duties and responsibilities as human beings must be shown to be so incontrovertible that even atheists must recognize them. There are ultimate taboos.","If man was the relative of animals, then animals were the relatives of man, and in degrees bearers of that inwardness of which man, the most advanced of their kin, is conscious in himself.","Unlike the interference of ordinary interest, power, or prejudice, which touches philosophy only at its outskirts and becomes at most a matter for philosophical tactics, the claim of revelation to the highest truth touches philosophy at its core and must affect its whole strategy.","We do violence to the consciousness of a past age when we divide what was indivisible to it: the one sacred truth of the Christian creed.","The will to set values and the power to make them law are jointly at the bottom of all operative norms. When linked to divine wisdom, this source of moral law is still in safe hands which man can trust."],"Hans Kung":["That means that every human being - without distinction of sex, age, race, skin color, language, religion, political view, or national or social origin - possesses an inalienable and untouchable dignity.","After two world wars, the collapse of fascism, nazism, communism and colonialism and the end of the cold war, humanity has entered a new phase of its history.","We are convinced of the fundamental unity of the human family.","The Gospel has to be the norm.","As a matter of fact, you have deficiencies in all religions, but you have truth in all religions.","Time and again we see leaders and members of religions incite aggression, fanaticism, hate, and xenophobia - even inspire and legitimate violent and bloody conflicts.","Humanity today possesses sufficient economic, cultural and spiritual resources to introduce a better global order.","A human person is infinitely precious and must be unconditionally protected.","Second, we also got a more authentic liturgy of the people of God, in the vernacular language.","It is an absolutely unique success of the church community to have introduced such an epoch-making change, in just a few years, without having a serious division.","And a third thing is the understanding of the Church as a community, a communion which is just a hierarchy but the people of God, whose servants are the priests and bishops.","That is the Roman way: to give favors to the favorites.","I remember the Curia said, that's up to the American bishops, not up to Rome.","If priests were allowed to marry, if this would be an optional thing, and if he could have wife and children, he would certainly have less temptation to satisfy certain sexual impulses with minors.","I like the catholicity in time: our tradition is one of 2,000 years.","But I have to add - and this answers your other question - this catholicity in time and in space is only meaningful for me if there is, at the same time, a concentration on the Gospel.","The Epistle to the Romans is an extremely important synthesis of the whole theology of St. Paul.","However, if the religions in essence merely repeat statements from the United Nations Human Rights Declaration, such a Declaration becomes superfluous; an ethic is more than rights.","Hundreds of millions of human beings on our planet increasingly suffer from unemployment, poverty, hunger, and the destruction of their families.","Religion often is misused for purely power-political goals, including war.","At the same time we are aware that our various religions and ethical traditions often offer very different bases for what is helpful and what is unhelpful for men and women, what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is evil.","We are conscious that religions cannot solve the economic, political and social problems of this earth.","All historical experience demonstrates the following: Our earth cannot be changed unless in the not too distant future an alteration in the consciousness of individuals is achieved."],"Hans Magnus Enzensberger":["Every orientation presupposes a disorientation.","Culture is a little like dropping an Alka-Seltzer into a glass - you don't see it, but somehow it does something.","Mediocrity in politics is not to be despised. Greatness is not needed."],"Hans Matheson":["That's quite a difficult thing in life, to be who you are. And when you are doing interviews, you kind of feel this need to say something interesting.","When I auditioned for drama college, they asked me to do my Shakespeare. I couldn't do it. They asked me to do my modern, and I couldn't do it. They asked me if I had a song prepared, and I said 'No,' so I sang 'Happy Birthday.' And I did a reasonable improvisation, a reasonable one, nothing special at all. I don't know how I got in, but I did.","I think the problem I have with films is that, because there's so much hype around them, they become bigger than they should be, really. There are things that people do every day in their little workshops that they'll take to heaven with them. You've got to realise that it's not everything, making films.","Put me in a costume, and I'm your man. I must have one of those faces which seems to suit period drama more than modern films and TV programmes. But I'm not complaining, I love going back in time. I feel quite lucky because nobody knows who I am. I can walk about and have ordinary conversations with people.","Playing characters who are wonderful and beautiful is hard because you don't feel like that most of the time... well, I don't. It's like this whole heart-throb nonsense. It's flattering, but that's not how I feel in the morning. It's something that goes with the job."],"Hans Rosling":["My best friend in medical school was a magician. And we were shown an X-ray of a sword-swallower, and I tried it and failed. Then I got a sword-swallower as a patient, and he taught me.","To get away from poverty, you need several things at the same time: school, health, and infrastructure - those are the public investments. And on the other side, you need market opportunities, information, employment, and human rights.","I am not an optimist. I'm a very serious possibilist. It's a new category where we take emotion apart and we just work analytically with the world.","The shining star in the world is Shanghai. That's what CEOs from big companies say - 'if I want mathematical analytical work done, it's done in China.'","The 1 to 2 billion poorest in the world, who don't have food for the day, suffer from the worst disease: globalization deficiency. The way globalization is occurring could be much better, but the worst thing is not being part of it. For those people, we need to support good civil societies and governments.","Beyond 2050 the world population may start to decrease if women across the world will have, on average, less than 2 children. But that decrease will be slow.","I've done a lot of practical anthropology, living in villages with people and realizing how difficult it is to get out of poverty. When in poverty, people use their skill to avoid hunger. They can't use it for progress.","You have to fit in sometimes to make people comfortable to listen to you.","Good analysis is very useful when you want to convert a political decision into an investment. It can also go the other way and drive policy.","Eighteen fifty-eight was a year of great technological advancement in the West. That was the year when Queen Victoria was able, for the first time, to communicate with President Buchanan, through the Transatlantic Telegraphic Cable. And they were the first to 'Twitter' transatlantically.","My interest is not data, it's the world. And part of world development you can see in numbers. Others, like human rights, empowerment of women, it's very difficult to measure in numbers.","I am a toxico-nutritional neuro-epidemiologist. It's the study of neurological disorders caused by a mixture of toxins and malnutrition using epidemiological methods... We are just three or four in the world, even fewer than sword swallowers.","There's still racism. Western Europe... has taken the native cultures of the Americas, the African cultures, the Asian civilization and lumped them together into The Others.","Cancer is awful. It took 10 years until I didn't think about it every day. Nobody should go through this. Nobody.","Fame is easy to acquire; impact is much more difficult.","Data allow your political judgments to be based on fact, to the extent that numbers describe realities.","I loved statistics from a young age. And I studied very much in Sweden. I used to be in the upper quarter of all courses I attended. But in St. John's, I was in the lower quarter. And the fact was that Indian students studied harder than we did in Sweden. They read the textbook twice, or three times or four times.","We have great international experts within India telling us that the climate is changing, and actions has to be taken, otherwise China and India would be the countries most to suffer from climate change.","I meet so many that think population growth is a major problem in regard to climate change. But the number of children born per year in the world has stopped growing since 1990. The total number of children below 15 years of age in the world are now relatively stable around 2 billion.","What I'm really worried about is war. Will the former rich countries really accept a completely changed world economy, and a shift of power away from where it has been the last 50 to 100 to 150 years, back to Asia?","Avoid war, because that always pushes human beings backward.","The number of children is not growing any longer in the world. We are still debating peak oil, but we have definitely reached peak child.","Well, the truth is I'm very scared for people to dislike me. I have conflict-avoidance.","When I have an argument with someone, even with someone I am not very close with, I can't sleep at night thinking about it. It's terrible. But I still manage speak out frankly because I have also been gifted with the ability to read people. I can sense when they start to get irritated with me, and then, I shift.","Fame is a dangerous thing. It's what the post-industrial society wants. They want fame and many followers on Twitter. But to really make the world understandable, that challenge is remaining.","While teaching a course on global development at Uppsala University in Sweden, I realized our students didn't have a fact-based worldview. They talked about 'we' and 'them.' They thought there were two groups of countries: the Western world, with small families and long lives, and the Third World, with large families and short lives.","There's about one sword-swallower per 2 to 4 million persons in each country.","There is still a severe and scary amount of extreme poverty in rural parts of India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Burma and sub-Saharan Africa."],"Hans Selye":["Adopting the right attitude can convert a negative stress into a positive one.","Its not stress that kills us, it is our reaction to it.","If you want to live a long life, focus on making contributions.","Every stress leaves an indelible scar, and the organism pays for its survival after a stressful situation by becoming a little older.","Man should not try to avoid stress any more than he would shun food, love or exercise.","As much as we thirst for approval we dread condemnation."],"Hans Urs von Balthasar":["Even if a unity of faith is not possible, a unity of love is.","Thus it is necessary to commence from an inescapable duality: the finite is not the infinite.","If one does away with the fact of the Resurrection, one also does away with the Cross, for both stand and fall together, and one would then have to find a new center for the whole message of the gospel.","Beauty is the disinterested one, without which the ancient world refused to understand itself, a word which both imperceptibly and yet unmistakably has bid farewell to our new world, a world of interests, leaving it to its own avarice and sadness.","Our situation today shows that beauty demands for itself at least as much courage and decision as do truth and goodness, and she will not allow herself to be separated and banned from her two sisters without taking them along with herself in an act of mysterious vengeance.","The work with which we embark on this first volume of a series of theological studies is a work with which the philosophical person does not begin, but rather concludes.","Without a doubt, at the center of the New Testament there stands the Cross, which receives its interpretation from the Resurrection.","But the issue is not only life and death but our existence before God and our being judged by him. All of us were sinners before him and worthy of condemnation.","The Christian response is contained in these two fundamental dogmas: that of the Trinity and that of the Incarnation. In the trinitarian dogma God is one, good, true, and beautiful because he is essentially Love, and Love supposes the one, the other, and their unity.","Not longer loved or fostered by religion, beauty is lifted from its face as a mask, and its absence exposes features on that face which threaten to become incomprehensible to man.","The One, the Good, the True, and the Beautiful, these are what we call the transcendental attributes of Being, because they surpass all the limits of essences and are coextensive with Being.","Prior to an individual's encounter with the love of God at a particular time in history, however, there has to be another, more fundamental and archetypal encounter, which belongs to the conditions of possibility of the appearance of divine love to man.","The inner reality of love can be recognized only by love.","Whoever removes the Cross and its interpretation by the New Testament from the center, in order to replace it, for example, with the social commitment of Jesus to the oppressed as a new center, no longer stands in continuity with the apostolic faith.","We no longer dare to believe in beauty and we make of it a mere appearance in order the more easily to dispose of it.","If God wishes to reveal the love that he harbors for the world, this love has to be something that the world can recognize, in spite of, or in fact in, its being wholly other.","It is, finally, a word is untimely in three different senses, and bearing it as one's treasure will not win one anyone's favours; one rather risks finding oneself outside everyone's camp... Beauty is the word that shall be our first.","St. Paul would say to the philosophers that God created man so that he would seek the Divine, try to attain the Divine. That is why all pre-Christian philosophy is theological at its summit.","The first attempt at a response: there must have been a fall, a decline, and the road to salvation can only be the return of the sensible finite into the intelligible infinite.","The Passion narratives are the first pieces of the Gospels that were composed as a unity.","To be sure, the response of faith to revelation, which God grants to the creature he chooses and moves with his love, occurs in such a way that it is truly the creature that provides the response, with its own nature and its natural powers of love."],"Hans Vestberg":["For us, we are moving a company that has been around for 137 years to the next level so that we can be there for the next 137 years.","Today there are two points where a car manufacturer has interaction with you as an owner of a car. One, you buy the car. Two, you go to the car shop to repair the car.","I need to build my team around my weaknesses.","You're going to see this 'Internet of things' start demanding network performance and making the networks much more aware of what is on top of them.","I believe in free trade. I don't support regulating trade prices between different regions. Our point of view is we don't want trade barriers between different countries.","I have rules for everything.","Men can't do much to change; we have to wear suits, although I never wear a tie, apart from in Asia sometimes. So I decided to grow my hair.","The infrastructure we provide is the same in a remote town in Africa or New York or an archipelago in Sweden: we use the same system, and the chips inside the phone are the same.","Even if you buy a Finnish, Korean or American phone - it will be Ericsson on the inside.","We do a lot of consumer research. Consumers believe the smartphone will be the remote, meaning that it will orchestrate a lot of things. So maybe you will take your connectivity with you to the car.","You don't need to recall 100,000 cars because you need to fix something. That can be done with a download of software.","Our take was that if we are going to support our customers, we have to help them with video distribution, whether that is iPad, TV, small screen or large screen.","We want to be number one, from the ingestion of content to the play-out to any type of channel. Everything between there, you should see Ericsson if you are a broadcaster, telecoms operator, or cable operator.","I was taking a break from university so I could play handball full-time for a year.","For us, it is very important all the time that our core business is really good but that we don't stop moving.","You can always think that we're old and not innovative, but there is no company that can limp on for 139 years without being creative and having the genes to change.","We want to be on the edge of technology all of the time. We think long-term.","Remember, China is the largest country in the world, so they have the confidence, the capital and resources to create large companies.","I said we're going to leave phones, and so we did. We sold it to Sony.","The IT bubble is the IT bubble, and of course, we became a company that contracted dramatically in 2001 and 2002: we basically came down by 45,000 people - a dramatic ramp-down.","When I came into the CEO office, I basically changed the entire management team. We knew that we had to change the company, so we needed a new set of leaders.","What was really tough for me was that Lars Magnus Ericsson founded Ericsson in 1876; we've always had a consumer product. And I'm the 16th CEO of Ericsson, and I decided that we don't have any consumer products anymore.","When you start losing market share, it's really tough to gain it back; you need the product portfolio and presence in many markets.","I think that we are trying to put data communications, telecommunications and media communications together and be the No. 1 player there.","India is an important market for Ericsson, not only as a telecom market but also as a global hub for R&D.","I manage my business; politicians are doing their business. I can only work within their rules and regulations. I can't pick up a political fight.","There are so many devices that can receive video, creating complexities, because suddenly you can have a TV, laptop, smartphone, pads. And they are of different sizes. It's clear that you need to standardise and get a much more efficient TV delivery.","It is very difficult for me to speculate as to how long it will take for the LTE-TDD ecosystem to mature. Of course, the whole industry is speaking of scale and a combination of scale in order to get more efficiency in the ecosystem.","When I look into the Ericsson's mobility report that has predictions till 2018, the majority of people having mobile broadband by 2018 will be on 3G.","It is users that are driving the networks with innovations on top of the networks and with innovations in the devices space. This is very healthy.","When it comes to meetings and preparing for that, it doesn't matter if it's a meeting with the U.N.; with a large operator, CEO, or chairman; or if I have an internal meeting - in all cases, I know that the energy and the engagement in every discussion is extremely important.","It's always great to have a purpose of a meeting and an ending for it, but it's even more important to be present and have an engagement on the topic you're doing, to create an environment and energy around that meeting, so everybody goes from there, 'That's great; we can take it forward!'","In order to have the next generation of modems, you would need to pour in even more R&D spending. We came to the conclusion that we're going to have a tough time to really see that we are going to succeed in the modems business.","For us to stay competitive, we're transforming our services business to be reliable and flexible.","No day is similar to another, but usually mail is part of my start of the day. Our company never sleeps: we have business in 180 countries, so there are no real mornings or nights.","I read mails throughout the day but answer mails more in the morning and evening.","If I am in Sweden, I try to get home to be with my children. I can do work after that from home.","My mail address is open for anyone, and I read all my mails by myself.","Historically, the mobile industry has been focused on the consumer, getting better performance and throughput to their devices.","For every $10 you reduce the price of the smartphone, 100 million more people will buy them.","By the end of 2020, the only region of the world that will still have a lot of 2G connections may be Africa.","I believe mobile technology has a much broader role to play. It could solve some of the biggest problems on earth.","We have the global scale, but not everyone has 4G in the world.","We need to understand what innovation will be built on top of our networks."],"Hans Zimmer":["If something happened where I couldn't write music anymore, it would kill me. It's not just a job. It's not just a hobby. It's why I get up in the morning.","The writing gets done away from the keyboard and away from the studio in my head, in solitude. And then I come in and hopefully have something, then I wrestle with sounds and picture all day long. But the ideas usually come from a more obscure place, like a conversation with a director, a still somebody shows you, or whatever.","Anything can become a musical sound. The wind on telegraph wires is a great sound; get it into your machine and play it and it becomes interesting.","You have to realize I like doing big movies that appear on a big screen. So the visuals and the audio have to be of a certain quality before I start to get excited about the thing.","Here's something I probably shouldn't be saying: I never listen to my soundtrack albums because I can't stand it. It's just stereo. When I write, I write in surround. My life is in surround.","When movies first came out, maybe they were in black and white and there wasn't any sound and people were saying the theater is still the place to be. But now movies and theater have found their own place in the world. They are each legitimate art forms.","With animated film, you have to create the sonic world; there's nothing there. You get to color things in more and you're allowed to overreach yourself a little bit more, and it's great fun.","'The Graduate' must be the best use of songs ever in a movie; it adds a layer to the movie you wouldn't ever get from a score."],"Hans-Georg Gadamer":["The focus of subjectivity is a distorting mirror.","The more language is a living operation, the less we are aware of it. Thus it follows from the self-forgetfulness of language that its real being consists in what is said in it.","Nothing exists except through language.","It is one of the primary motives of modern art that it wants to abolish the distance which the viewer, the consumer, the audience maintain vis-a-vis a work of art.","The real being of language is that into which we are taken up when we hear it - what is said.","Long before we understand ourselves through the process of self-examination, we understand ourselves in a self-evident way in the family, society and state in which we live.","It was clear to me that the forms of consciousness of our inherited and acquired historical education - aesthetic consciousness and historical consciousness - presented alienated forms of our true historical being.","In fact history does not belong to us; but we belong to it.","I basically only read books that are over 2,000 years old."],"Hans-Ulrich Obrist":["I would go from one city to the next, inspired by the monks in the Middle Ages, who would carry knowledge from one monastery to the next monastery.","In this new age of GPS, Google Earth and multidimensional digital maps, mapping is suddenly hugely relevant again.","At a certain time, an artist needs a big retrospective. At other times, they need a more focused exhibition. It's a different story each time; it's about establishing a dialogue.","I remember going to a monastery library when I was very young and being surrounded by ancient books. I fell in love.","I see a curator as a catalyst, generator and motivator - a sparring partner, accompanying the artist while they build a show, and a bridge builder, creating a bridge to the public.","Exhibitions are kind of ephemeral moments, sometimes magic moments, and when they're gone, they're gone.","I think the art fair is very much a form of urbanism. I think something really happens to the cities when such a fair happens. The city becomes an exhibition; it's amazing.","To keep art stimulating, it's important to open it up to new horizons, which includes showing it in unexpected contexts.","Making art is not the matter of a moment, and nor is making an exhibition; curating follows art.","My job is art curator, not artist. All I have ever wanted to do is immerse myself in art, to enjoy it, to learn about it, to write about it, to talk to others about it.","For me, the idea of curating can be expanded. Curating science, curating art, music and theater and performance and not only bring those things into art but bring art into those areas.","I always have coffee and porridge for breakfast.","When I was 17, I met many artists, and it started to become this conversation with artists out of which all of my exhibitions grew.","Numerous are the posthumous museums and memorials devoted exclusively to one artist, architect or author and designed to preserve or artificially reconstruct the namesake's original working or living conditions.","I really do think artists are the most important people on the planet, and if what I do is a utility and helps them, then that makes me happy. I want to be helpful.","I don't wake up in the morning and think about Franz Kline.","There is nothing deeper than to work for a year with the same artist.","I started going to exhibitions in Switzerland when I was 10 or 11. As a schoolboy, I would go every afternoon to see the long, thin figures of Giacometti.","Many artists have not been able to realise their fondest projects. My role is to help them.","I'm trying to expand the notion of curating. Exhibitions need not only take place in galleries, need not only involve displaying objects. Art can appear where we expect it least.","One of my favourite exhibitions is called 'Do It,' which I co-curated with the artists Christian Boltanski and Bertrand Lavier 21 years ago.","Everything I do is somehow connected to velocity.","Switzerland felt incredibly narrow, growing up. It was good, in a way. There were so many museums. But it was always a no-brainer that I would have to leave, and I'm grateful for that.","I went to the studio of Fischli Weiss, and it was magical. I thought: 'This is what I want to do with my life; I want to work with artists and be useful to them.' I was magnetically attracted.","I spent 250 to 300 days of every year on the road. But in the end, I felt something was missing. I needed to be anchored so I could concentrate, so in 2000, I established a new methodology - the one I use today. I spent the week in my office and travelled every weekend, even at Christmas.","From 1991 to 2000, I was totally nomadic. I was travelling 300 days a year and building out my research. These were a bit like my learning and migrating years, so to say.","Mr. Koons's work has always inspired architects, which I think is very interesting. I think he is an artist who has reinvented himself so many times and reinvented so many different series.","I founded a club, which is called the Brutally Early Club. It's basically a breakfast salon for the 21st century where art meets science meets architecture meets literature.","My most famous show is the 'Kitchen Show.' More famous than any gallery show or museum show I curated.","I still remember my first Giacometti exhibition, and going back to the museum every day, whenever I could, to look again and again at these long, thin stick figures, so beautiful, so graceful. That, I think, was the moment I became really obsessed by art.","I read whenever possible, and I buy books all the time, sometimes online, but mostly from bookshops. I love literature. If you want to understand art, it's important to understand what is also happening in literature, in music, in science, in architecture.","Exhibitions usually are not collected; they disperse after they take place.","For me, it's always been very essential to work on projects that one can work on almost for their entire life.","Since 2000, I've been based in Paris at the Musee d'Art Moderne de la Ville, curating the programme there. Internationally, it's a very open situation that goes beyond national boundaries; directors and curators move from one country to another, which has opened up the museum landscape.","Most cities have a centre surrounded by suburbs, but London has numerous centres: it's the model of a twenty-first century metropolis.","At Performa in New York, there are a lot of commissions, but Manchester Festival is the only festival where everything is fully produced by the festival.","Alex Poots has always made a bridge between highly experimental and the mainstream.","The 21st-century curator works in a supremely globalised reality.","During my time at high school and university in Kreuzlingen and St. Gallen, I traveled around Europe looking at art, visiting artists, studios, galleries and museums.","The non-utility of my kitchen could be transformed into its utility for art. To do a show there would mix art and life, naturally.","Our economy's growth functions by inciting us to produce more and more with each passing year. In turn, we require cultural forms to enable us to sort through the glut, and our rituals are once again directed towards the immaterial, towards quality and not quantity.","I'm very interested in the idea of unusual museums, ones that are not necessarily contemporary art museums - more like historical collections or house museums.","For me, the making of exhibitions has always had to do with dialogue: a concentrated, in-depth, focused dialogue with artists, who keep teaching me that exhibitions should always invent new rules for the game.","Fly-in, fly-out curating nearly always produces superficial results; it's a practice that goes hand in hand with the fashion for applying the word 'curating' to everything that involves simply making a choice - radio playlists, hotel decor, even the food stalls in New York's High Line Park.","My great inspiration has always been Studs Terkel, who is a wonderful American oral historian. He was a radio DJ at first, interviewed a lot of jazz musicians, and at some point started to interview Americans about work.","To record is a process against forgetting. I do interviews because it's what I've been doing every day for a few hours since I was a kid. I've always talked to artists.","I met Gerhard Richter and Alighiero Boetti when I was a teenager, and I was really inspired by them. When Boetti died, I realized I only vaguely remembered so many things he told me. It was such a pity. Had I only recorded his voice, he would still be with me, and I could listen to it from time to time.","When I was a kid and started to be obsessed by art in the 1980s, the art world was in this polarity Warhol/Beuys, Beuys/Warhol. Both expended the notion of art extremely, but in very different ways.","At a certain moment, when I started doing my own shows, I felt it would be really interesting to know what is the history of my profession. I realized that there was no book, which was kind of a shock.","It's quite an obscure notion for a kid, no? To want to be a curator. But even then, I knew that I would do this.","I have many intense friendships with artists. I don't mean we have intense one-day conversations but ongoing conversations that last in some cases for years.","To be honest, I think, for me, the power is always with art. The art world clearly couldn't happen without art."],"Hansie Cronje":["I realized I made a big mistake and if I could have it over again, I would do it so much differently.","I always played to win.","It's good fun, yes, but when we play, we take it seriously and want to do well.","I love surfing more than cricket, more interesting and you meet great people.","I think the toughest part for me was when Herschelle said that he obviously looked up to his Captain, and he felt if his Captain could do it, then so could he, and that to me was when it really struck home.","If the coach is good, I don't think a psychologist is needed.","The very quick and high sales of the book caught us off guard, but fortunately we got the second edition from the printers at the end of last week and the shops should now be stocked again.","We didn't sleep last week - we literally didn't sleep - because we've been so busy with the book.","We really tried hard not to make it a cricket book, it appeals to a much wider community."],"Hansika Motwani":["There is no point in pointing fingers because there are three fingers pointing back at you.","People don't know that when there is something running in my mind, I start smiling. If I'm angry, I smile and blush.","I hate interference, and I don't interfere in others' lives.","I have painted gods, and goddesses too, and my favourite is Ganesha and Radha Krishna.","Brad Pitt is amazingly talented and equally good-looking, too.","My parents have put in a lot of efforts for me. Whatever I am and wherever I am is because of them. I won't do anything to displease them.","Building a home for neglected senior citizens is my long time dream.","I've finished 12th standard from Poddar International and enrolled for B.A. in political science in Cambridge University, London. It's a correspondence course, and I'll go to London for my exams once a year. That way, I can devote more time to films.","Everyone has a breakup in their lives, and I think everyone should experience love.","Fame gives you a high.","Asked to choose between money and fame, I'd choose the latter every time.","I watch my films with my mum and other family members, you know. I also know there are thousands of women who watch my films. I don't want to set wrong examples.","As a 17-year-old, I remember positively dreading dance sequences. I would come to shoots, quaking with nervousness at the idea of making other artistes do retakes due to my mistakes.","Whenever I am asked about my personal relationships, I politely reply, 'No comments.'","The Tamil industry, while being better than all the other film industries when it comes to treating female actors, is still dominated by men. So, I can only work within the space offered to heroines, and I think I am doing that.","I had worked in Hindi films like 'Jaago,' 'Abra Ka Dabra,' 'Koi Mil Gaya,' but 'Desamuduru' was a different experience.","My mum is my biggest critic. She said I was good for the first film, but I can still be better, and I need to polish my acting skills.","I need to thank my director, producers, and artists as well crew members of all my projects.","I always give importance to scripts first, and remuneration is something that comes later.","I'm happy with my commercial heroine tag.","When the time is right, I will do female-centric films.","I make it a point to study the character I do, and if the story demands that I wear a particular outfit, I'm game.","I concentrate on doing good projects.","What's the point of doing a great character in a bad film? Instead, I want audiences to thoroughly enjoy a film and remember my part when they walk out of a cinema hall.","I do feel bad when my films don't do well, but I respect audiences' verdict because they know well which films to support. If they don't like a film, we should accept it.","The only time my workout goes a little haywire is when I'm travelling.","I've been working on the screen right from childhood and am completely in love with my work. And this experience has taught me that ultimately, it's a good script, good work that matters, whether in Bollywood or in the South.","I think it is very important for all actors to complete their studies side by side.","My workout involves cardio, jogging, and yoga as well. I am a firm believer of yoga and meditation.","My personal life is also cinema.","I love Chennai and its people. My mother always tells me, 'You should have been born a South Indian!'","The camera and I have always had good chemistry.","'Power' is a very special film for me and is one of the finest films of my career. I have played a character that I have never done before. My role has a lot of comedy.","Ravi Teja helps the co-artistes, and he is a very kind person.","I entered the industry at very young age, and I was like any normal girl at the age of 17 or 18. At that age, most girls are a little plump.","When I turned 21, I started losing weight - again, a normal thing for any girl my age. I did not take a conscious decision to reduce my weight.","As an actor, it is okay to fall and get up. Then you can give your best. Sometimes audiences don't receive it well, but you have to take it in the right sense. It is part and parcel of being in the industry.","I am not a party person.","I paint, and painting gives me my much needed break from my routine. Painting was a subject in my school, and I developed a liking for the lines and colours and started practising in my free time. It helps me de-stress amidst my hectic shooting schedules.","All actresses, including me, want to look great on screen.","I'm competing with myself first, as my aim is to improve my performance in every film.","I'm not bothered about what others are doing. All I want to do is excel in whatever it is that I do.","I'm worth every penny because I'm a complete professional who does her work well.","I went around Coimbatore quite often while I was shooting for Velayudham. It's a fascinating place with a lot of energy.","I love the ubiquitous idly-dosa combination. In fact, that was my pet name as a kid! In school, I would bug the canteen boys to get me my daily quota of idly!","When I was shooting in Pollachi, I had tried out a lot of local food, most of them I don't remember the names of.","My character in 'OK OK' has a lot of attitude, and it is an interesting one.","Even when I turn 60, they'll call me a child actor.","Since I come from an educated background, I love to study.","I like to collect DVDs of most English films.","I don't have a favourite romantic scene, but I enjoy romantic movies like 'Ghost' and 'Music and Lyrics.'","My mom has helped me nurture my interest and hone my talent.","I have not seen 'Vaalu' yet, but I am sure it will be good.","Obviously I will promote 'Vaalu.' It is my film. I am the lead actress in it; I play a major part, and I will promote the film.","I am in love with myself, with my friends, with my family, with kids, with life and my movies.","Silence is my dignity.","I am only a dog lover, and I have a nice fawn-colored one at home.","I am a very reserved person and have very few friends in the industry, while most of my close ones are from school and college.","I make sure that whatever film I do, I enjoy my role.","In 'Manithan' I did not again play a bubbly thing, but my character was calm and composed.","I can say that I don't compete with others and only with myself because I do so many films.","Everyone has their opinion, and if no one criticizes, how will I improve my work?","I am very lucky I got fans, and I interact with them personally. I know that they have poured their love on me unconditionally, and all I can do is work hard and be kind to them.","I'm very punctual. I wish I could change this about myself because most people around me are not.","I keep going to New York every year for 20 to 25 days. I love it there, but I can't imagine settling in any place other than India.","Every good movie I watch, the hero becomes my favourite. I start blushing every time a hero romances a heroine.","I don't read books."],"Hansjorg Wyss":["We have so many rich people in Switzerland. They should take more responsibility for the general public. There is almost no tradition of philanthropy here anymore, unlike in the U.S.","Nobody knows me, and I hope that it stays like this.","I am very grateful for the opportunities I've had and feel I have a duty to repay my good fortune through philanthropic endeavors that expand the reach of human possibility and compassion.","Two things are vital for me. I've always had people who protected me, and I've always had people who helped me. Before I decide, I consult with three, four people who I trust."],"Hanya Yanagihara":["In Mumbai, the air is saltier. The sea is roilier. The traffic is snarlier. The pinks are pinker. The ostentation is crazier.","Every traveler knows too well the endless quest for the perfect travel bag: the one that's stylish enough to carry through Paris, sturdy enough to tote around Peru, and - most important - doesn't make your shoulder sag even before you've loaded it up with everything you need for a day of sightseeing.","Part of adulthood is searching for the people who understand you.","Misanthropy is born, I think, out of an almost oppressive sense of loneliness, a conviction that there's no one on earth who understands you. I don't think misanthropes hate people: They hate that people hate them.","Florence is perhaps best known for being the seat of Renaissance art, and rightly so: A greatest-hits collection of artists passed through its streets - Michelangelo, Leonardo, Botticelli, and Brunelleschi among them.","When we think of India, most of us are in fact thinking of Rajasthan, that large splotch of dun-colored desert in the country's northwest which, from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, was ruled by a succession of maharajas whose sense of color, opulence, and splendor created the most enduring images of India in the West.","Jaipur, like Florence or Kyoto, other artisan-rich cities to which it roughly compares, has always been known for its craftsmanship.","In a basic sense, 'A Little Life' is a homage to how my friends and I live our lives. I wanted to push past the definitions of how we typically define friendship. It's a different version of adulthood, but it's no less important and no less legitimate than anyone else's.","I wanted to see how flavors, spices, and grains traveled back and forth along the Silk Road and were interpreted by a multitude of cultures' palates.","No religion makes more use of color than Hinduism, with its blue-skinned gods and peony-lipped goddesses, and even the spring festival of Holi is focused on color: Boys squirt arcs of dyed water on passersby or dump powder, all violently hued, on their marks.","I was interested about how relationships change as you get older. You are great friends in your 20s. In your 30s, you get married. Your 40s are all about your kids. In your 50s, you get divorced, and your friendships become primary again.","The first thing I do whenever I go to Thailand is seek out the closest restaurant or stall selling mango-and-sticky rice: it's a little hillock of glutinous rice drenched in lashings of coconut milk and served with fresh mango.","The original Grand Tour would generally begin in Belgium or the Netherlands before moving through Paris, Geneva, Spain, Italy, and perhaps Greece.","I think there are patterns of the aftermath of colonization that you see echoed in cultures and communities across the world.","In novels, and American novels in particular, it's not just about redemption, it's about forward movement and healing oneself. Americans are very big on getting better.","The term 'pashmina' is often used interchangeably with 'cashmere,' but in reality, pashmina is a specific type of very fine, lofty cashmere, woven from a specific type of goat - one indigenous to northern India, Nepal, and Pakistan, and harvested and woven there as well.","Photography is always a kind of stealing. A theft from the subject. Artists are assaulters in a lot of ways, and the viewer is complicit in that assault.","One of the things I'm fascinated by as a traveler is watching how different countries control how they let the world encounter them.","Where most of the country is, well, hot - from the bone-baking dry heat of the desert to the flesh-melting humidity of Kerala in the south - Kashmir is cool: so cool, in fact, that in the winter, the temperatures can sink to sub-zero.","Those of us lucky enough to fall in love with Asia know that it's an affair that's as long as it is resonant.","Anyone who has been to India - specifically Rajasthan, the rich and kingly region in the country's northwest - knows that when it comes to adornment, Indians do not think like other people.","Hong Kong has plenty of superlative hotels, amazing food, and cool shopping.","Be aware of who in your life is actually interested in hearing you discuss your writing, and who's just asking to be polite. Listening to writers talk about their work is often excruciatingly dull.","One of the writers I most admire is Hilary Mantel because in the middle of her career, she just changed paths entirely and became just a totally different novelist.","I have never wanted a family. I don't believe in marriage, though I obviously believe it should be legal for everyone who wants to do it. But it is not something I believe in, nor do the characters in my book, nor do any of my friends.","I was born in L.A., then we moved to Hawaii, then we moved to New York, then we moved to Baltimore, then we moved to California, then we moved to Hawaii, then we moved to Texas, then we moved to Hawaii, then we moved to California. This was before I was 17.","Life will end in death and unhappiness, but we do it anyway.","I do have the sense that, although there may be no one way to write a novel, there are many novelists who are in fact part of some sort of larger literary community, whether in the form of a writing group or an MFA program, to name two of the more common forms.","I think at first I didn't tell anyone I was writing something because I found so tedious the people who did.","I'd be far too self-conscious and insecure if I suspected my editor might be a better novelist than I.","I've always thought that one of the least successful encounters is meeting a writer one admires. For one thing, writers are generally much kinder, more empathetic, more generous people on the page than they are in person.","I wrote my second novel, 'A Little Life,' in what I still think of as a fever dream: For 18 months, I was unable to properly concentrate on anything else.","From 1999 through 2001, I was an editor at a now-defunct magazine about the media industry called 'Brill's Content' that eventually merged with a now-defunct website about the media industry called Inside.com.","There is something uniquely American about the motel: It speaks to the transient nature of America itself, one enabled and encouraged by our roads and highways.","There comes a point when you're writing a novel when you're in it so deep that the life of the novel becomes more real to you than life itself. You have to write your way out of it; once you're there, it's too late to abandon.","I wanted to write a story about colonization and about Hawaii. I went to college right at the height of identity politics, and that's how I always read 'The Tempest,' for example.","One of the fun things about unreliable narrators is they can be funny. You can admire things about them and laugh with them.","Publishing is a business, and I completely understand it. But when you don't have to depend on writing for your identity or your income, you can do whatever you want.","I think fiction writers should work. If you have a job and are not living off advances or grants, you never have to make concessions in your writing, ever.","When you write a novel, you never have to be in the service of the reader. My only concern with my books is that the world that's created be as logical and whole as possible.","So much of writing isn't the fun parts like we get to discuss. It is sitting there putting the words down.","I think for a lot of people, friendship is a relationship that gets devalued once they move on to what people consider to be more important relationships: once you find a partner or when you have kids.","What makes a fulfilling relationship or fulfilling life is not simply found in another. It's found in a group of others.","I think that fiction writers can write about anyone. If you are writing a character, and the only thing they are to you is their otherness, then you haven't written a character.","My father was a research doctor at the National Institutes of Health in the early 1980s, and you couldn't work in the field and not know about D. Carleton Gajdusek, who my father often mentioned.","We imbue deserts and the tundra with menace because nothing, or little, grows there.","I don't think that genius goes hand in hand with being socially inept or being a sociopath or being a misanthrope, but I do think that it is a mind that can think so differently - so beyond how one is supposed to think.","The process of being a writer is much more interior than being a scientist, because science is so reactionary.","I think that all research scientists think of themselves as belonging to a grand tradition, building on work that has been worked on since the very beginning of science itself. Whereas I'm not sure writers think of themselves in the same way.","I always wanted to be a scientist. I don't really have any writer friends.","We think of the 1950s as an oppressive time in the culture, and indeed it was, but it was also in many ways a more secular moment, and one in which great scientific achievements flourished. I don't want to get too gauzy about this, but there was much more respect for science as a necessary part of society.","You see a virus very differently when it's caught and suspended on a slab of glass than when you're observing how it's ravaged a fellow human being.","I think anything goes in fiction as long as it fits within the interior logic of the work itself and is presented in a disciplined manner.","I don't believe in post-racial or post-gay or post-anything, but I do think within a certain group of friends, what matters less is the specificities of race and sexuality, and what matters more is the shared experience, shared language and shared cultural touch points.","What any writer hopes for is that the reader will stick with you to the end of the contract and that there is a level of submission on the reader's part.","Sometimes we all work so hard to overcome various things, and we are very cruel as a society and tough on people who we think aren't trying hard enough.","I really don't have anything urgent to say, and I think you shouldn't write unless you have something urgent to say. Sometimes that troubles me, and sometimes I don't really care.","The only difference between a good writer who publishes a book and a good writer who doesn't is that the writer who publishes actually finished her book.","Writing is, by its nature, interior work. So being forced to be around people is a great gift for a novelist. You get to be reminded, daily, of how people think, how they speak, how they live; the things they worry about, the things they hope for, the things they fear.","We think of writing a book as a process, but the very word - process - suggests that there is one: a template to follow, a map to guide us. If that were true, someone would have surely figured out some marketable method we could all buy.","The nice thing about publishing later in life is that you already know who you are. You don't have to hang out with the 'Paris Review' crowd to try to make yourself feel like a legitimate writer.","Friendship is one of our most treasured relationships, but it isn't codified and celebrated; it's never going to give you a party.","I think I passed up a lot of opportunities for love because I was too interested in identity politics.","If the only thing you knew about Oman was its location, you might never go at all.","We tend to talk about death as if it is losing a battle, but that assumes living is winning and dying is not.","When you have very lax parents, you tend to get more conservative kids.","I think Bhutanese food - long dissed by every food writer out there - has gotten a bum rap.","I go to Japan every November on vacation, and the one thing I never return home without is yuba, which is the thin skin that forms atop boiling soy milk. You skim it off and either eat it fresh or dry it.","I love how Vietnamese cuisine always tastes like flowers, and how they had the ingenious idea of pairing that floral flavor with seafood: such a combination shouldn't work as well as it does.","I took a 51 day trip through Asia; 12 countries and 26 cities. I traveled for 51 days. So, it was everywhere from Sri Lanka and that all the way to Japan, where we ended it.","There's something nice and intimate about having a book. You know that someone's actually gone on this journey. You know that someone has actually researched and reported all these things. You can see and hear their tone in what they chosen to include and what they haven't.","I live in Soho in lower New York; there's tons and tons of tourists right outside my door step, obviously. Most of them are European, and all of them have guidebooks. I never see anyone looking at a phone.","Even before it opened its retail arm, Beigh was renowned among pashmina cognoscenti for the quality and complexity of the work produced in its workshop, a large, airy, sunlit rectangle of a room directly across from its second-floor shop.","Kashmir, the 86,000-square-mile region in India's north, both is and isn't the India of the popular imagination.","Go to any Shinto temple in Japan and you'll see it: a simple stand from which hang hundreds of wooden postcard-size plaques with a colorful image on one side and, on the other, densely scribbled Japanese characters in black felt-tip pen, pleas to the gods for help or succor.","I have only a few really enviable skills, but packing - condensing just the right amount of stuff into a single bag, whether the trip is for a weekend or, as in this case, seven weeks - is one of them.","The speed limit on most of Maui's highways is forty miles per hour, but my mother never went above thirty.","Although both of us were raised on Oahu, in Honolulu, my mother has always had fond memories of Maui; this was, after all, where she and my father, then penniless yet oddly optimistic newlyweds, honeymooned in 1969.","Any frequent visitor to Hawaii is fixated on mapping how the islands have changed since their last visit.","The first thing many tourists see in Hawaii is concrete - a long dreary stretch of it through landscapes dominated by sad, cheap apartment buildings and almost entirely denuded of plant life.","Sometimes, of course, there's no quick way to make it through immigration: Different airports have gluts of incoming flights at different times of day, and short of rearranging your flight schedule to ensure you'll land at a low-traffic hour, there's nothing you can do.","Once you join the queue for the immigration line, pay attention to what the expeditor tells you. Have your papers ready. Don't have your cell phone out. Take off your hat. Open your passport to the page with your photo and present it to the immigration officer already open.","It's a funny thing about cities: Some have brief, bright moments of cultural and political dominance, decades- or centuries-long spells when they seem the center of their particular nation, or region, or empire... only to later fall into obscurity and disrepair, never to regain their former glory.","The beauty of a Moroccan riad is undeniable, but even the most die-hard fan may find herself growing a little weary of what can come to feel like a one-size-fits-all aesthetic: tilework, white Berber rugs, woolen tribal throw pillows in reds and ochers, cut-metal lanterns.","Unlike Milan, Italy's banking capital, or Rome, its religious center, Florence was the place where the rich went to buy goods that would showcase how wealthy they were.","Eating local is a relatively new concept in American dining; for the Italians, it's a way of life.","Between their rise in the thirteenth century and their sudden fall in the seventeenth, when the line abruptly ended, the Medicis produced three popes, two queens, and many Florentine rulers, and they supported the work of Galileo, Michelangelo, Leonardo, and Botticelli - a veritable parade of geniuses.","Of course, no one has enough time to see every shop that Mumbai has: That would take more lifetimes than even the gods could offer."],"Harald zur Hausen":["It is important to note that there exist vast gender differences in the global role of papillomaviruses in human cancers. This is mainly due to the role of this virus family in the induction of cancer of the cervix.","Maybe I should mention it: I was not from the beginning mainly interested in papilloma virus; I was mainly interested in infectious agents in human cancer. So papilloma viruses came up as the most likely candidate from my viewpoint.","Born in 1936, I experienced the Second World War as a child in the city of Gelsenkirchen-Buer. This area was heavily bombed, but fortunately, all members of my family survived the war and post-war period.","As a child, I remember my own intensive interest in biology, birds, other animals and flowers and was determined at an early age to become a scientist.","After briefly considering whether to study biology or medicine, I opted for medicine and initiated my studies at the University of Bonn. The first two years were particularly hard, since I simultaneously decided to attend lectures and courses in biology as well.","In retrospect, I have devoted my scientific life mainly to the question to what extent infectious agents contribute to human cancer, trusting that this will contribute to novel modes of cancer prevention, diagnosis and, hopefully, later on, also to cancer therapy.","Most of the infections linked to human cancers are common in human populations; they are ubiquitous. They were present during the whole human evolution process.","Regional clustering of specific cancer types triggered some investigations on a potential role of infectious agents in these malignant proliferations.","Whereas HIV only in recent decades became infectious for humans, high risk papillomavirus types have in all likelihood been with us for millions of years, accompanying the human race since the early days of our evolution."],"Harbhajan Singh":["I define friendship as a bond that transcends all barriers. When you are ready to expect anything and everything from friends, good, bad or ugly... that's what I call true friendship.","It's very hard to find true friends when your life is a bumpy ride full of twists and turns. But, I'm glad that amidst all the ramblings in my life I have managed to win some great friends.","Cricket is my passion; it is my first love. So I will not act in my movies, as they will just be a side business for me.","I would say I am an ordinary bowler but one with a really big heart, and that's what has stood me in good stead in all these years.","You cannot keep doing the same things. According to the situation, your role changes in one-day cricket, especially in a phase like the Powerplay. If I bowl four spells, four times I will be playing a different role.","I do not fear grassy tracks. Whether there is grass or not on the wicket, I am not worried.","Sometimes I just get over-excited. I see the pitch and I think, 'I have to get this wicket.' When I am just looking to bowl, I am calm and composed, and most of the time I get it right. The ball lands where I want it to.","Either you face the challenges in life head on or back out. And I am not someone to back out from challenges.","There have been a few friends who have taught me some great lessons in life. I wouldn't like to name them. They did things that I never expected out of them that left me heart-broken. It was during these rough patches in life that they left me alone. I know now that it was only my position that they were interested in.","Thinking about your role will automatically get you in the frame of mind to get your strategy and game plan right before you step onto that field.","Being a professional cricketer, you have to adapt to the conditions quickly. It takes time to get rhythm when you are constantly traveling from one country to another.","You need to understand the batsman, where he plays his shot usually, which is his release shot, and then change the angle, vary the pace, line and length. You cannot always react after being at the receiving end.","A bowler is his own captain. I know what needs to be done, what the ball is doing. If you don't know where you are going to bowl and where you think the batsman will hit, then how can you tell the captain what you want? You are the judge.","Four hundred is a lot. When I was young, I remember Kapil Dev getting it, and it was quite a big thing. An Indian had taken it. I feel honoured and proud that God has given me a chance to reach 400 wickets. It's a big thing for me; I don't know about others.","I am not a great fan of computers. I do watch videos and analyse which batsman is playing how. Batsmen can play different shots on different days. A batsman may not play cover drives well, but if he connects with two such shots, he starts playing the drive well on that day.","I am very emotional. It took me many years to recover from the death of my father. Even when I was playing cricket, I wasn't happy. I would just sit and cry. I was very young. He was too young; he shouldn't have gone. Cricket is all right. We all play sport. Good and bad days come.","International sport is a lonely journey. You compete with one's self and try to grow as a cricketer.","Age is just a number. If someone can perform at 45, who will stop that fellow from playing top-level cricket?","For me, making my intent clear to the batsman before he stamps his authority is important. Playing with his mind is a way of attacking rather than setting attacking fields.","It is always challenging bowling abroad - you don't get much spin, bounce. You do get bounce, but you don't get sideways spin. It is always drifting kind of spin you get.","I like wearing good clothes. Some of my friends who are into making clothes told me since I was already playing with my own brand of bat sticker, I should make a foray in fashion. The idea has worked very well.","Not just cricket, we are doing clothing for football, hockey etc. It's basic stuff, but good designing is what I am looking to do.","I do not play golf regularly, but I feel that hitting the moving ball in cricket is tougher than hitting a stationary ball as in golf, which requires more concentration and steady hands.","Most of the cricketers are doing side businesses apart from playing the sport, so why should I be left behind. I feel there is a lot of money in making films, and since Punjabi cinema is doing good, this is a lucrative option for me.","I am just enjoying what cricket has given me. In sports, it's obviously really important for all of us to remain fit - and health is wealth, so health comes with the sport.","According to the situation, your role changes in one-day cricket, especially in a phase like the Powerplay. If I bowl four spells, four times I will be playing a different role. If I come in the first Powerplay, and say the opposition are 70 for no loss after 10 overs, I will be looking to take a wicket.","The batsman does not always need to create big hits. He can hit a boundary, then pick up some singles and still gets nine runs. To avoid that, I need to plan in a way where he must look to hit wherever there is a fielder. That is what is called 'bowling to the field.'","You have to see if the batsman is coming out, if he is staying back, what his grip is like, to gauge his intentions. A common trend I have observed is, a lot of batsmen change their grips when they are looking to hit: normally they either go high or slide their hand to the bottom of the handle to get maximum power.","If Indians were not largehearted, they wouldn't have made so much of progress and delivered growth.","If you keep telling a youngster he is no good, he might begin to doubt himself. A pat on the back could bring the very best out of him.","You don't become the leading spinner of the team by just talking. You have to perform well consistently over a long period of time. I have bowled well and won games for India. That is why I am the No. 1 spinner. Every time I have taken the field, I have given my 100%.","There are days where you do everything right and nothing goes in your favour.","It is very disappointing to see the Punjabi music scene of today. The lyrical quality has deteriorated; it is only people like Sartaaj and Gurdas Maan Ji who are sticking to their roots.","In India, it is difficult for a cricketer to show that he is under some kind of stress. Here, you can only retire when you don't want to play anymore, or the motivation is lacking.","For a spinner growing up in England, it is challenging to become an off-spinner. The line and length needs to be altered on each of the four days of county cricket or five days of Test matches. The pitches in England don't have a set pattern. It changes with each day, and accordingly, the length varies.","I have entered the sports equipment business with 'Bhajji Sports.' I am applying for ICC clearance so that cricket bats with 'Bhajji Sports' logos could be used for international matches. In domestic circuit, the Punjab team is already wearing Bhajji Sports dresses for the Ranji Trophy matches.","I am honoured to be associated with a brand like Movado. It believes in the art of design and is known for its perfection worldwide. I have strong faith in the pursuit of perfection. I am looking forward to a long association.","I just don't know the art of making friends with girls. And that's the reason why I've never had a single girl as a friend. Also, I'm so engrossed in cricket that I've never found an opportunity to interact with girls very closely. In a way, it's better, as my mind doesn't get diverted!","I am proud to be a Sikh and am a true disciple of Guru Gobind Singh, who sacrificed his entire family for the Sikh religion.","Let's face it: fitness is boring. But it's critical to be extremely dedicated to whatever you decide to take up to achieve a desired result. There's no way you are going to get there without dedication, which is the key for me.","When you're young, you want to live fast, but you definitely don't want to die young. At the same time, you want to do things in slow, progressive manner that will benefit you in the future. Don't jump into things.","I think cricket is there in Usain Bolt's blood. Since I got to watch from close quarters, it was amazing to see him run up to bowl. The perfect delivery stride is understandable because he is a world champion athlete. But the manner - he loaded at the crease and then bowled the ball - left me zapped. He looked like a natural cricketer."],"Hari Kondabolu":["I would love the opportunity to create my own program. I feel like a TV show with a format of monologue with lots of sketches thrown in could be really fun. But you know, that may never happen. Minimally, I just want to keep making stand-up.","I am actually a bit chubby, and I eat everything. I eat in a way - if my parents fed me the way I choose to eat as an adult, they would've lost custody.","I'm not a politician, I'm not an ideologue, I'm not an organizer anymore. I'm a human being sharing ideas, and those ideas have to feel fresh and from my heart and my head, and I have to feel it. You can't force that feeling.","Both my parents are immigrants. I've seen different struggles they've had. There's a reason you don't see me using accents. I don't do impressions of my folks. When I'm doing a crappy impression of my folks, and you're laughing, I'm thinking, 'When my parents talk to people, when they walk away do people do impressions of them? Do they laugh?'","I like playing with that space between laughter and discomfort where your discomfort can also make you laugh, and you're confused about the mixed feelings. That's challenging, and I think that's what makes for some of the best art.","When you ask your white friends what their cultural heritage is, they don't just say white. They give you a math equation. 'Well, I'm a third German and a fourth Irish and one-sixteenth Welsh and one-fortieth Native American for college applications.'","Heckles always vary. I mean, some people are just drunk, and it's nonsense, or, you know, some people just want to just repeat something I've said or add their own two cents about an opinion, but because of the nature of what I do and who I am, like, I also get the racist stuff, which is hard.","I want to write my own stuff, and, you know, it would be nice to put myself in it. But I would like to hope that there are going to be better roles offered as well and that I don't need to do everything. You know, like, I appreciate my career being somewhat DIY, but it would be nice to get some help.","I've been approached after shows from people who said, 'I don't agree with anything you said, but I laughed the whole way through.' That's still a little strange to me. Like, nothing, really? But at the same time, that's what happens in a conversation.","When I started doing standup when I was 17, I was talking about being Indian and specifically ethnic jokes. Straightforward stuff that was fairly ignorant that I knew would get the laugh. It wasn't flipping stereotypes; it was using them.","Introductions are always weird for me because my name is Hari and it's constantly mispronounced . 'Hurry', 'Hairy' - there are different ways to screw it up, and it leads to these awkward conversations.","When you see a comedian on stage, the best comedians make it feel like a conversation. But it's not. We have very little interest in what an audience has to say during a performance. Being a stand-up comedian, you're an egomaniac to some degree. Everyone wants to hear what you have to say, apparently. That's not how real relationships work.","I'm not like most comedians. I don't deal with just heckles - I'm also dealing with threats and anger. Here I am, a brown person on stage being quite blunt. I talk about white privilege; I talk about U.S. imperialistic practices; I talk about colonialism. I'm not saying things that are easy for people to laugh at.","I try to be as thoughtful as I can about everything that comes out of my mouth and not reinforce sexism.","The words we use have weight. Whether it's in a conversation with a friend or something said publicly on stage or broadcast. And as performers, we know that because that's why we choose the words we use - that's the whole point of comedy.","Seattle is a place I've lived only a couple of years, but I feel like I've been adopted by this city. It's like a hug. I've been recognized on planes, in the airport and by cabdrivers. I don't get that anywhere else in the country.","Stand-up will always be my first love, and it has been the primary way I've expressed myself since I was 17.","January 14, 2000, was my first time on stage, and I've been hooked ever since. I got discovered nationally in Seattle by the now-defunct HBO Comedy Festival, and that led to an appearance on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live' and a path to a professional comedy career.","You can be funny and say what you mean; these ideas are not mutually exclusive. Some of the best jokes came from people who meant it. See: Pryor, Bruce, Carlin, etc.","I am frozen musically somewhere around 2004.","I'm not a Republican, but I was one once - when I was 7 years old. Not my fault. The symbol of the Republican Party is an elephant, I'm a Hindu - I was confused.","After 9/11, I changed a lot of the ways I viewed the world. I realized my comedy and my politics and my view of the world did not match. I had to start writing from my heart.","Politics and sports are the same thing in some ways. I like sports; I don't like the sports aspect of politics. The conventions are basically the playoffs, and the election's the Super Bowl. To me, it doesn't feel important.","Post 9/11, brown people had this force pushing us together. It's like we're all being looked at with fear and suspicion; we're all being targeted, so how do you support yourself and your communities?","I feel privileged that I've been able to get anywhere, with my quote-unquote limited mainstream appeal, given my race and subject matter. Of course, I always have my masters to fall back on."],"Hari Kunzru":["Intellectuals who live in Hungary, or who wish to work or lecture there, are extremely circumspect in their criticism.","I realized I had a novel on my hands, but didn't know where it was going to go. So I thought, 'I'm going to do everything that you're not supposed to do when you plan a novel; I'm going to step back and let this thing take itself wherever it wants to go, and I'm not going to worry about how things connect until later on.'","These days we're all hyper-aware of the canonical way in which stories are supposed to play out - people are taught all about three-act scripting and where to put the reversal and all of that - and I think we can do more interesting narratives.","As I got older I became a kind of sub cultural junkie, foraging around in music, street fashion and eventually art, politics and the freakier reaches of the Internet, hunting the next discovery, the next seam of underground gold.","In my early teens, science fiction and fantasy had an almost-total hold over my imagination. Their outcast status was part of their appeal.","There are things about our world that almost by their nature defy our ability to comprehend them. Some people use a religious register to deal with that - they call it God and that's a way of domesticating it.","I stand on my public record as a defender of the human rights of Muslims, notably my work for Moazzam Begg and other British Muslims detained without trial in Guantanamo Bay.","But it's the particularity of a place, the physical experience of being in a place, that makes it onto the page. That's why I don't just do library research. I very rarely write about somewhere I haven't been.","I think it's important for all culturally literate people to understand the technological substrate of new developments.","I'm interested in complexity, in the mathematical sense, as well as the idiomatic sense. The idea of emergence - that it's possible for complex patterns to arise out of many simple interactions - is fascinating.","I enjoy thinking myself into other times and places. I don't like some of the conventions of the 'historical novel', but I think there's a way of doing it that has a lot of merit.","There's an explosion of Indian fiction of all kinds, from military thrillers to chicklit. I think that's exciting.","I'm fascinated by the emergence of a global class. They're highly mobile; they reject the idea of place.","I can see a version of my life where it all becomes meaningless. On a good day, writing seems noble. Other times, it's narcissistic and pointless.","Suburbia is all about private ownership and not having to share, and it leads to a paranoid, defensive mindset. I know this, having grown up in Essex.","I suffer from vertigo. It's paralyzing in extreme situations. The most scared I've been as an adult was trying to conquer that fear by going climbing in Wales.","Being in Harlem on the night of Barack Obama's election was extraordinary. It was the best street party I have ever gone to, and it felt like the period of American history which began with slavery had ended that evening.","There's nothing New York likes more than a thing. Or a place. Or a place that's a thing. Or a thing that happens to be a place.","Say there are three identical-looking pizza joints on a street. Two of those will always be empty. The third will have a line of people patiently waiting, checking their phones. There's always one place that's the place. That's how it works.","When I try to understand somebody, create a character, I fall into them. When I think writers are telling me what to think, I get harrumphy.","I like moral judgment to emerge from the reader. We are being sold a very simplistic morality by our leaders at a time when nuance and understanding are at a premium.","There are still some terrible cliches in the presentation of Indian fiction. The lotus flower. The hennaed hands. In mainland Europe, people still slap these images on my books and I go bananas.","I tried to take seriously the idea that if you tortured language you might arrive at some new truth. Later it became clear to me that I was retreading ground by fighting the literary battles of the 1950s and 1960s, and that I was actually a bit bored by some of the books I professed to love.","Some books I've kept because the binding is beautiful - I'm unlikely ever to read my grandmother's copy of 'The Life of Lord Nelson.' I'm addicted to secondhand bookshops."],"Harish Rawat":["Our first challenge is to ensure safety of pilgrims, and we will use modern technology for that. We will strengthen our telecom network and will provide special mobile apps to the pilgrims at the time of registration.","I was a candidate in 1991. There was virtually a wave for Ram Mandir. In 1989 also, there was a wave - anti-Congress wave.","I have changed the style of functioning of the government and administration and managed to change the perception."],"Harlan Coben":["I like to see the difference between good and evil as kind of like the foul line at a baseball game. It's very thin, it's made of something very flimsy like lime, and if you cross it, it really starts to blur where fair becomes foul and foul becomes fair.","Hope can be the most wonderful thing in the world or it can crush your heart like an eggshell.","Life may not always fall into neat chapters, and you may not always get the satisfying ending you're looking for, but sometimes a good explanation is all the rewrite you need.","This is the price you pay for having a great father. You get the wonder, the joy, the tender moments - and you get the tears at the end, too.","More than once, I've wished my real life had a delete key.","What I want to do is tell stories about normal people in the American suburbs. I don't write the book where it's a conspiracy reaching the prime minister; I don't write the book with the big serial killer who lops off heads. My setting is a very placid pool of suburbia, family life. And within that I can make pretty big splashes.","I'm 48 years old, not a kid anymore by any definition, but here is a universal truth that every adult at some point will realize: We are all always 17 years old, waiting for our lives to begin.","I don't necessarily love the sports per se, I love the stories behind them. Also in a kind of perverse way I like to study what it does to us, why we care so much. It's caring about something that's utterly meaningless.","Make no mistake, adolescence is a war. No one gets out unscathed.","In the end, we know what makes us happy. We also know what makes us unhappy. That's the irony. We know and yet we still mess it up. That's part of the human condition, no, and why we need to work on it.","The muse is not an angelic voice that sits on your shoulder and sings sweetly. The muse is the most annoying whine. The muse isn't hard to find, just hard to like - she follows you everywhere, tapping you on the shoulder, demanding that you stop doing whatever else you might be doing and pay attention to her.","I live in the suburbs, the final battleground of the American dream, where people get married and have kids and try to scratch out a happy life for themselves.","A novel is like a sausage. You might like the final taste but you don't want to see how it was made.","Let me back up a little and tell you why I prefer writing to real life: You can rewrite. A novel, for example, can be cleaned up, altered, trimmed, improved. Life, on the other hand, is one big messy rough draft.","In real life, coincidences happen all the time. In novels, they are leapt upon with fury.","There are three things that make a person a writer: inspiration, perspiration and desperation.","I can write pretty much anywhere if you give me time and some quiet. The home is not usually the best place because I have four children. It's usually pandemonium around here!","I don't find any real rivalries with crime and thriller writers anyway. That might sound a little Pollyanna, but for the most part the writers I compete with, if you want to use that word, it's a pretty friendly rivalry. I think we all realise that the boat rises and sinks together.","I always think the insecurity is going to go away, but it's always there. Only bad writers think they're good.","When you like something and you're pretty good at it and you can make a living doing it, you don't ask why. You just count your blessings and go with it.","The actual writing time is a lot shorter than the thinking time. I don't do too many notes. I keep it mostly in my head. I usually start writing a new book around January, and it's due October 1.","I'd never had money growing up, and it's never been that important to me, except maybe to take our kids on a nice vacation or something like that.","I never bought the excuse of not having time to write. If you really want to do it, you're either going to find those hours or eventually decide not to be a writer.","Writing my first book, I think in hindsight I went into it saying, 'It's gonna sell.' I was earning enough to scrape by sometime around a book or two before 'Tell No One.' I moved up from $50,000 to $75,000, then $150,000 for each book. I had never thought I would be doing anything else. I had enough encouragement.","I'm not very happy idle. There's always this voice in my head that says, 'I should be writing.'","I'm a little bit of a control freak.","The most annoying and full-of-crap thing a writer says is, 'I write only for myself, I don't care if anyone reads it.' A writer without a reader doesn't exist.","I am, after all, a thriller writer. I routinely delve into the darkest chambers of the human heart. I've written about murder, kidnapping, depravity, horror, violence, and disfigurement.","Being a parent is not for the faint of heart. I may joke about knowing fear, but the fact is, the first time I ever knew real fear was the day Charlotte, my first child, was born. Suddenly there is someone in the world you care about more than anything.","Children learn much more from how you act than from what you tell them. There are times this worries me - we parents are rarely the role models we want to be. True for life. True for driving.","You can't have an up without a down, a right without a left, a back without a front - or a happy without a sad.","You know, people call mystery novels or thrillers 'puzzles.' I never understood that, because when I buy a puzzle, I already know what it is. It's on the box. And even if I don't, if it's a 5,000-piece puzzle of the 'Mona Lisa', it's not like I put the last piece in and go, 'I had no idea it's the 'Mona Lisa'!'","And I love the twist. I love to fool you once, I love to fool you twice, and on the very last page, quite often - very last paragraph sometimes - I like to just play with your perception one more time in a way that makes everything that came before just a little bit different.","'Caught' is a novel of forgiveness, and the past and the present - who should be and who shouldn't be forgiven. None of my books are ever just about thrills, or it won't work.","I'm not a fan of self-help books - how can something be 'self-help' if the book itself is purportedly helping you?","I would never write a memoir, because it would be too boring.","If I didn't write, I'd be like a duvet cover; I have no other marketable skills. Clearly I'm not meant to do anything else.","The preparation for building a series of thrillers based on a single character is kind of like the preparation for becoming a parent: The best part is the idea - wink, wink.","Writing isn't about the process. It is about creating. The joy comes not from the process but from the creation.","Outlining is not writing. Coming up with ideas is not writing. Researching is not writing. Creating characters is not writing. Only writing is writing.","If I don't write, I hate myself. Simple as that. My life is out of balance.","I love stories. When I'm writing, what I pretend subconsciously is that we're cavemen, we're sitting around the fire, and I'm telling you stories. If I bore you, you're probably going to pick up a big club and hit me over the head.","Writers always say, 'I always knew I wanted to be a writer; when I was a three-month-old foetus a pen formed in my hand and I began to scratch my first story on the inside of my mother's womb.' I started later, in my early twenties.","My house has too many distractions. There's the email. There's checking my Amazon ranking. I know I'm the only author who's ever done that, ever. There's the fax. Too many distractions. I like to go out and write.","We're called New Jersey but we're actually the suburbs of New York.","No characters in 'Stay Close,' including the leads, are black and white. I want them to be grey. I think that makes for a much more interesting reading experience, something that will stay with you a little bit longer.","I wrote seven Myron Bolitar novels in a row, and I never want to write a Myron book where he just solves a crime. Every one of them I want to be personal, and I want him to grow and change. The problem with that is, it makes the series limited, you can't write a series where a guy is always going through some kind of crisis.","The book I always say that influenced me, subconsciously, because at the time I didn't know I wanted to be a writer, was William Goldman's 'Marathon Man.' That was the first adult thriller that I loved. I read it when I was 15 or so, when my father gave it to me.","The readers are the ones who let us live our dreams. I try to write books which are really compelling - that you'd take on vacation and rather than going out, you'd read in your hotel room because you had to find out what happened. Hopefully that's what readers are responding to.","Losing my parents was the most crushing thing that ever happened to me. I lost my dad when I was 26, and it changed my life entirely.","I'm the Jerry Lewis of crime fiction.","Tragedy is a hell of a teacher. It's much too strict, but it's a hell of a teacher.","I am very lucky that I get to tell stories for a living. I love being able to grab people's attention, to keep them turning the pages, to make them stay awake all night. I want to stir the pulse, yes, but also to stir the heart. I hope 'The Woods' does that.","When I was seventeen, I worked as a counsellor at a co-ed sleep-away camp for eight weeks. I loved it but it could be harrowing - it was far too much responsibility for someone my age.","The state of New Jersey is really two places - terrible cities and wonderful suburbs. I live in the suburbs, the final battleground of the American dream, where people get married and have kids and try to scratch out a happy life for themselves. It's very romantic in that way, but a bit naive. I like to play with that in my work.","When I'm writing, what I pretend subconsciously is that we're cavemen, we're sitting around the fire, and I'm telling you stories. If I bore you, you're probably going to pick up a big club and hit me over the head.","I love to fool you once, I love to fool you twice, I love to fool you a third time. And just when you think it's all over, I have what I call that Carrie hand-out-of-the-grave moment. Just when you think it's all over, I'm going to hit you with just one more. I can't help myself.","I'm not a big sports fan.","I like to go out and write. So I'll often go to a Starbucks or a local coffee bar, and I'll sit there and I'll write. I can write pretty much anywhere.","I've never chased the dollar, I've always chased the reader's heart. I love having more readers. The more people who read it, the more thrilled I am.","I love to make even villains people you can relate to. When you find out who did it, I think you almost like the person, which is not easy to do.","I always say three things make a writer: inspiration, obviously; perspiration, doing the work. But the third is desperation. I'm not really fit for anything else, or to have a real job. That fear drives me. The pressure has always been self inflicted.","I once worked as a tour guide in the Costa del Sol of Spain.","Frankly I'm fairly boring or fairly busy. Between writing and family, I have little time for anything else.","I'm thinking of taking up golf, but the idea of spending time with golfers frightens me.","I pretty much only wear Lilly Pulitzer ties because my best friend owns the company.","If I didn't write, I'd be like a duvet cover; I have no other marketable skills.","I remember the days of sitting at book signings, playing with my pen when no one would come, and still I even then thought I was living the dream, because I had a book out.","Sometimes even when the book is over I don't know who's good and who's bad. It's really more interesting, I think, to write about gray characters than it is to write about black and white.","That's what a good crime novelist - any good novelist - should do with you: play with your perceptions while showing you everything in plain sight.","Writing is one of the few activities where quantity will inevitably make quality. The more you write, the better you're going to get at it.","I am very lucky that I get to tell stories for a living. I love being able to grab people's attention, to keep them turning the pages, to make them stay awake all night.","I'm not very happy idle.","Only bad writers think they're good.","A writer without a reader doesn't exist.","In short, the satisfaction of creating, not necessarily the process, always lifts my heart.","If I'm not writing well, I'm not happy. If I'm not spending enough time with my family, I'm not happy. If I'm not connecting to friends or if I don't work out enough... You get the point. Everything has to be balanced. Nothing should be an extreme.","I try to stress to my children that buying something never leads to true happiness."],"Harlan Ellison":["The two most common elements in the universe are hydrogen and stupidity.","Love ain't nothing but sex misspelled.","When belief in a god dies, the god dies.","To say more, is to say less.","I have no mouth, and I must scream.","I hate being wrong, but I love it when I'm set straight.","I don't mind you thinking I'm stupid, but don't talk to me like I'm stupid."],"Harlan Howard":["Country music is three chords and the truth.","I take a whole life story and compress it into three minutes.","A lot of songs you write are just for exercise - just pencil sharpeners.","I'm always collecting emotions for future reference.","Work is both my living and my pleasure."],"Harlan Stone":["Democracy cannot survive without the guidance of a creative minority.","Distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.","To say that only those businesses affected with a public interest may be regulated is but another way of stating that all those businesses which may be regulated are affected with a public interest."],"Harland Williams":["The thing I love about sketch is sometimes it leads you as opposed to you leading it.","The problem with binge-watching on Netflix is that you lose three days of your life.","I think life would be so much funnier if every day you saw someone walking down the street getting hit in the head by a monkey, don't you?","I love seafood. Whenever I'm in Las Vegas, I love going to the Bellagio buffet because they have these great king crab legs.","I always improvise with the crowd. Sometimes it will be a 50 percent show, sometimes 70 percent, sometimes it's almost a whole show where I wing it. It depends on my mood, the energy in the room. For sure, a portion of it is just kind of winging it.","My roots are in stand-up, and stand-up is very freeing. There's no script involved; you just fly.","I was walking around bored one day, and I started filming stuff with my cellphone. There are all these shows where people are trying to do these outrageous stunts, and I thought it would be funny to do all these stunts that aren't outrageous but then act like they are.","It was such a pleasure to work with Eugene Levy. What a treat. That's a guy I grew up watching as a kid. Guys like that, they were hilarious and didn't have to be super vile or X-rated.","If you're going to take a jab at someone, you should at least have a bit more of a personal relationship with them. I feel like you can be funny and clever, as opposed to just outright vile.","I just tried to create a life for myself that's full of fun and fantasy and things that equal laughter. My life's been cartoons and comedy and acting, and it's just been a fun life, man.","I used to do little sketches into my cassette tape recorder when I was a little boy. I would just turn it on and just start doing voices and characters. I just loved it.","What's interesting about Stephen Baldwin is that me and Dana Gould were originally cast for 'Bio-Dome' - but Pauly Shore and Baldwin ended up doing it. So there's a little movie trivia for ya.","In 'There's Something About Mary' and 'Dumb & Dumber,' I ended up improvising quite a bit of my scenes, and later I didn't even remember what I'd said because I just winged it. When I went and saw the movie, I was as stunned as everyone else was.","The thing is, you never know with any movie how it's going to turn out. It's always a mystery - you'll do pages and pages of scenes that will never make it onto the screen.","I don't go on tour tours - I just go randomly to cities to do shows if I have an opening in my schedule.","I grew up on Don Knotts and Jerry Lewis and all the guys from Second City.","I think a lot of people think I'm doing kind of a character onstage, but what you're really getting is just me.","If you were to come out and hang out with me, just having fun at a nightclub or a party, that's kind of the version of Harland you'd get - silly, kind of always saying wacky things.","I try to take normal things - whether it's a serious subject or something as obscure as a piece of toast - and put a very weird twist on them.","I'd done a ton of movies here in Hollywood, and I realized that every movie I'd done was somebody's else's work and someone else's vision.","I hate when you go into a nice restaurant - someplace where you're going to spend good money - and there are kids in there crying.","I sort of write onstage. I'll throw an idea out there, like Home Depot, and just start talking about it.","Without sounding negative, I'm not a huge fan of a lot of stand-up. I'm more interested in an absurd kind of theater.","I don't laugh so much at jokes and premises as I do at a guy who goes onstage and starts twitching and acting funny.","I'd like to explore the more abstract side of people's minds, as opposed to the usual sitcom stuff. I don't want to do the typical sitcom-type humor. I'd want to do stuff like go bowling with pineapples.","I get a lot of people telling me that I'd make a good 'wacky neighbor.' I wouldn't mind that, if it was a starting-off point.","Canada has been a breeding ground for great comedic actors, sketch artists and stand-up comedians. We grew up with a different perspective on the world.","I'm an American citizen now, but I will always have Canadian pride."],"Harley Quinn Smith":["In my opinion, villains are so much more interesting than heroes. So 'Suicide Squad' is just like, wow, so damn awesome.","I will not leave this Earth until I play Harley Quinn.","My dad has actually really influenced me musically. I have a weird love for '80s and '90s music. A lot of people are like, 'Are you serious? It's so lame.' But my dad always plays that in the car whenever we're together.","Comedy is such a vulnerable thing. With drama, you're not trying to make someone cry. If you do, great, but that's not your goal. With comedy, you're trying to make someone laugh, so to me, it's harder because you are in such a vulnerable position. You're like, 'I hope people like this. I hope I do the joke justice.'","If people love 'Gremlins' so much and 'Clueless,' 'Yoga Hosers' is not that weird. It is very weird, but compared to that stuff, it's not that different.","I'll never get another first premiere again, especially at Sundance. I've just been trying to fully engage myself in everything that's going on, and I hope to see other movies here while I'm here! I really want to!","I'd like to be involved in 'SNL' somehow. I mean, being a permanent cast member is a stretch! That's pretty damned hard, but to host it one day would be a dream come true. And I would like to play the DC Comics villain Harley Quinn.","My dad brought 'Clerks' to Sundance 22 years ago, and that's when his career started.","Never let anybody get you down. Never give in to people who say nasty things on the Internet. Work to represent women in the best way possible because, even though respect and equality for women has progressed over time, it's still not in the place that it should be."],"Harley Viera-Newton":["My grandmother impressed upon me the importance of family, and my grandfather encouraged my hunger for learning.","Don't take yourself too seriously! You only live once!","I love coming to London and seeing what people on the street are wearing.","I like everything from Miu Miu. Dolce & Gabbana cocktail dresses are a party essential; they're so flattering.","I put everything into my hand luggage! Really, I do!","I like to mix British classics, like a great trench, with fun vintage pieces I find in New York. L.A. style is often very relaxed and comfortable, and I appreciate that effortless feel.","I started D.J.-ing my first year of college just for fun and to pay bills.","Modeling has always played off my D.J.-ing, but it is a fun supplement.","Fashion and music have always played off each other and certainly do for me; I love both so much. But there are definitely those moments when you're playing the right song at the right time in the right place, and it feels like the best job in the world.","My mother is a proud Brazilian. I love visiting my family in Rio; the city and its people are so vibrant and amazing.","I was definitely surrounded by music and fashion at a very, very young age."],"Harmon Killebrew":["My father used to play with my brother and me in the yard. Mother would come out and say, 'You're tearing up the grass'; 'We're not raising grass,' Dad would reply. 'We're raising boys.'","I do everything in a straightforward manner.","It takes a lot of dedication to quit smoking, and whether you give up for good on your first try or have to give it a couple of tries - just keep swinging at it and you will succeed.","I'm not a quitter. All my career, I went through a lot of physical adversity, injuries. It's in my nature to be a battler.","Hospice is such a tremendous thing. Patients seem to reach an inner peace.","I didn't have evil intentions, but I guess I did have power.","No matter what, I've always been an optimistic person.","Life is precious and time is a key element. Let's make every moment count and help those who have a greater need than our own.","I always tried to watch the pitcher and his complete windup from the moment he had the ball in his glove all the way through his motion, and tried to follow it all the way out of his hand, all the way to home plate.","Joe Mauer's the real deal. He is absolutely wonderful. Not only is he a great player, but he's a great human being. He's the kind of guy you'd like to see... be your son.","I found out early in life that I could hit a baseball farther than most players, and that's what I tried to do.","I didn't think much about batting average when I was playing.","When I was 14, and for the next four years, I was lifting and hauling 10-gallon milk cans full of milk. That will put muscles on you even if you're not trying.","I was set to go to Oregon to play college baseball and football.","I want to say that maybe I've made some wrong decisions, but I'm still an honorable person, and I intend to take care of all of my obligations.","In baseball, you pack your uniform in the clubhouse after a ball game, and you see it hanging up in your locker when you get to your next city.","There was a time when rival teams used a shift against me. They would put the second baseman on the shortstop's side of the bag, move the shortstop into the hole to his right, and have the third baseman hug the foul line. The idea was to build an infield wall against a known right-handed pull hitter.","Pitchers are smart. They know they are much better off if they mix things up and keep you off-balance.","It must be nice for today's hitters when you don't have to worry about being thrown at. It's a whole different deal. When I played, getting knocked down was an accepted part of the game.","Hitting .400 is something you can do by yourself. But you have to rely on guys getting on base at the right time to drive in that many runs.","At Tiger Stadium, the dugouts are so low that you walk in and hit your head on the ceiling. People would say, 'Don't feel bad. Ty Cobb did the same thing.'","I like happy endings.","The Mayo Clinic is one of the largest and most experienced medical centers treating esophageal cancer in the world.","I speak very highly of Jim Thome. Not only is he a great player, but he's a great individual.","The people in the Upper Midwest were the same kind of people I grew up around in Idaho.","Society doesn't like to deal with death, but it is a natural part of living."],"Harmony Korine":["I have a pretty good family. But ever since I was little, I just felt like I wanted to be on my own. It was the same thing about school.","I've always liked street lights, and I've always photographed them. I probably have a collection of two to three thousand photographs of them, just around the city, mainly at night.","Skateboarding was everything to us growing up. It changes the way you see the world: you spend all day looking for ditches.","I purposefully try to make films in that grey area, where things are morally ambiguous. It's like life: good people do horrible things, and bad people do good things, and there's beauty in horror and horror in beauty.","I never cared about making one coherent masterpiece with a conventional narrative. I always wanted my movies to have images falling from all directions in a vaudevillian way. If you didn't like what was happening in one scene, you could just snooze through it until the next scene.","If I see something that's morally ambiguous or ambiguously beautiful or has some pull in some way, I won't censor myself; I always run towards the light.","When I'm directing films, I mostly try to create an environment on set that mimics what's in my mind as to the tone and feel of things. I try to create a place where you feel that anything's possible.","I was free when I was 12 because I got my first skateboard. I've been free ever since.","I'd always heard stories about how Harpo Marx was the most talkative of the Marx brothers. I found it interesting that someone you never got to hear speak in films would never not speak in real life.","When I was a child, the temptation to sin was always a romantic option. This romantic option led me to the cinema, a place where sin was welcome.","I look at WorldstarHipHop in the morning, Bossip, Global Grind, and everything in between, but it's all so quick, I don't even think about it. And I've never been a fan of lyrical or socially conscious rap music.","What I remember myself from films, and what I love about films, is specific scenes and characters.","Cinema sustains life. It captures death in its progress.","Rap is the only interesting music left - it's the only genre that's still pushing itself, and experimenting in a way that I find exciting.","What makes Gucci Mane Gucci Mane is like what made Frank Sinatra Frank Sinatra - it's just him. He's trap's Frank Sinatra.","I've started lots of books, but it's hard for me to finish them.","I don't even know how people read new fiction anymore because there's so much old fiction that exists that seems great that's unread. It's overwhelming to me. But, I mean, I do read. But there probably haven't been many people less literate than me that have been in 'The Paris Review.'","I studied writing at NYU. I graduated high school in Nashville and then went to the creative writing program, and in the first year, that's when I wrote 'Kids.'","I had these experiences as a kid; I remember certain things happening in school that were horrifying that I would see, certain things of violence or certain things of cruelty, but around that, something might happen afterwards to cause everyone to laugh, and that always blew me away.","I tried college and I hated that. I seem to quit everything I do.","I was born 'Harmony,' and it was weird because when I was a little kid, I was picked on so much that when I was 13, I changed my name to Harmful. I thought it was a tougher name, so I had it legally changed. And then, I don't know, it just didn't seem to catch on, so... legally, my name is still Harmful, but I just said I'll go back to Harmony.","I'm not a video brat. I don't derive all my inspiration through movies. I get it from a lot of other places, too.","I had a guidance counsellor who made me take an aptitude test, and told me I should be a bricklayer.","I never feel like there's any one point to the film, to anything, to any of the movies I've made.","Everything has to have some kind of a point for people to breathe easy. What's the point of life? I have no clue, but sometimes there are things that just attract us and pull us in a certain way.","When I had my first camera - I was a child of the '80s. I remember what it was like reusing the same tapes over and over again, and having really bad quality and images kind of bubbling up from under the surface.","I always get sick of these conversations where people are so obsessed with pixels, with high definition, and even with technology in general. I find it just dull and heartless. And so I wanted to use only the worst machines.","Sometimes, when you watch people play a video game, they seem lost in this wormhole, or in a trance.","You can still make music that people love, but there won't be more innovation. I started listening to electronic music a long time ago. But mostly I listen to rap. I think rap is the most interesting.","I never liked socially conscious rap. I like rap that's physical, that's about a beat and bass and repetition.","I always try to make films in such a way that it's hard to imagine how they came to be, or where they came from.","I use to live on this street when I was a kid where there was an old person retirement home, and all of the old people would listen to that band Herman's Hermits, and they would wear white nursing shoes. And they would throw away stacks of VHS tapes, and I would go through the trash and take them.","I've always - honestly - never thought of myself as an independent director.","I've always wanted to be a very commercial director, or I had dreams of making these movies into blockbusters. And with each movie, they tell me it's not that way.","When I started making movies, I was pretty young, and at the time I felt like there needed to be more confrontation in cinema - or I needed to make something more disruptive - so in the beginning, those movies were me wanting to play with the rules.","I do have friends who make movies, but for the most part, I never really wanted to feel like I was part of an industry.","My knock with filmmaking is the whole bureaucracy around it, so in some ways, staying outside of it is easier for me.","I've just always liked watching people dance. I can't explain it. It used to just make me laugh.","When I was a kid, I loved Nicholas brothers films. It was like skateboarding. Even Gene Kelly: I always preferred him to Fred Astaire, just because he was more athletic, like skateboarding.","I tried working odd jobs that had nothing to do with creating, and it was difficult for me. In the end, I just always loved movies. When I'm making a film, I feel most alive, like I'm doing the right thing, and I'm in the place where I need to be.","Ever since I was little, I would just make stories up in my mind. It was based on people I saw in the street or someone I would talk to, or I would hear a specific voice.","I've never actually directed anything I haven't made up. I've never adapted anything.","I've never had to pitch a movie to a studio. I usually just let people read the script, then I cast it. I always think pitching is for baseball.","I don't listen to music made by white people. I especially hate anything where a guitar is used. I don't listen to white people and guitars.","Here's the thing that people don't understand: I don't really care. I've never been a careerist. It's not a strategy. I react to certain characters and story lines and specific mode of filmmaking.","Some of the most radical work is being done in the most commercially pop venues, and some of the most boring work is being done in avant-garde territory.","I never really feel wrong while making movies. I know myself, and I know that my intentions are pure and I'm on the side of righteousness.","It's hard to say things without coming off in a certain way, but at a young age, I felt very driven. All I ever wanted to be is a soldier of cinema.","I always wanted the films to play in malls, and I wanted as many people as possible to see them. I never want them to be marginalized in the kind of rarefied, elitist world. I always have hopes that the films will permeate culture in a big way. A lot of times, I'm wrong, but it's always the hope.","I don't make movies for the same reason that a lot of people do. I make films because I need to see them exist in a very specific way."],"Harold Acton":["So often is the virgin sheet of paper more real than what one has to say, and so often one regrets having marred it.","The biographies and autobiographies are on the whole more impressive than the fiction of the last two decades, but the freakish best sellers among them are least likely to withstand the test of time."],"Harold B. Lee":["The most important message that I can give to you and to all the world is to keep the commandments of God.","The laws of God given to mankind are embodied in the gospel plan, and the Church of Jesus Christ is made responsible for teaching these laws to the world.","My humble prayer is that all men everywhere may understand more fully the significance of the atonement of the Savior of all mankind, who has given us the plan of salvation which will lead us into eternal life, where God and Christ dwell."],"Harold Bloom":["What matters in literature in the end is surely the idiosyncratic, the individual, the flavor or the color of a particular human suffering.","In fact, it is Shakespeare who gives us the map of the mind. It is Shakespeare who invents Freudian Psychology. Freud finds ways of translating it into supposedly analytical vocabulary.","Shakespeare will not make us better, and he will not make us worse, but he may teach us how to overhear ourselves when we talk to ourselves... he may teach us how to accept change in ourselves as in others, and perhaps even the final form of change.","We read deeply for varied reasons, most of them familiar: that we cannot know enough people profoundly enough; that we need to know ourselves better; that we require knowledge, not just of self and others, but of the way things are.","All that a critic, as critic, can give poets is the deadly encouragement that never ceases to remind them of how heavy their inheritance is.","In the finest critics one hears the full cry of the human. They tell one why it matters to read.","Shakespeare is the true multicultural author. He exists in all languages. He is put on the stage everywhere. Everyone feels that they are represented by him on the stage.","If they wish to alleviate the sufferings of the exploited classes, let them live up to their pretensions, let them abandon the academy and go out there and work politically and economically and in a humanitarian spirit.","But in the end, in the end one is alone. We are all of us alone. I mean I'm told these days we have to consider ourselves as being in society... but in the end one knows one is alone, that one lives at the heart of a solitude.","The world does not get to be a better or a worse place; it just gets more senescent.","The world gets older, without getting either better or worse and so does literature. But I do think that the drab current phenomenon that passes for literary studies in the university will finally provide its own corrective.","What we call a poem is mostly what is not there on the page. The strength of any poem is the poems that it has managed to exclude.","I think Freud is about contamination, but I think that is something he learned from Shakespeare, because Shakespeare is about nothing but contamination, you might say.","I would say that there is no future for literary studies as such in the United States.","I have never believed that the critic is the rival of the poet, but I do believe that criticism is a genre of literature or it does not exist.","Criticism in the universities, I'll have to admit, has entered a phase where I am totally out of sympathy with 95% of what goes on. It's Stalinism without Stalin.","Criticism starts - it has to start - with a real passion for reading. It can come in adolescence, even in your twenties, but you must fall in love with poems.","I don't believe in myths of decline or myths of progress, even as regards the literary scene.","I take it that a successful therapy is an oxymoron.","If I were to sum up the negative reactions to my work, I think there are two primary causes: one is that if there is discourse about anxiety it is necessarily going to induce anxiety. It will represent a return of the repressed for a great many people.","Indeed the three prophecies about the death of individual art are, in their different ways, those of Hegel, Marx, and Freud. I don't see any way of getting beyond those prophecies.","No poem, not even Shakespeare or Milton or Chaucer, is ever strong enough to totally exclude every crucial precursor text or poem.","Shakespeare is universal.","Sometimes one succeeds, sometimes one fails.","The second, and I think this is the much more overt and I think it is the main cause, I have been increasingly demonstrating or trying to demonstrate that every possible stance a critic, a scholar, a teacher can take towards a poem is itself inevitably and necessarily poetic.","What I think I have in common with the school of deconstruction is the mode of negative thinking or negative awareness, in the technical, philosophical sense of the negative, but which comes to me through negative theology.","What is supposed to be the very essence of Judaism - which is the notion that it is by study that you make yourself a holy people - is nowhere present in Hebrew tradition before the end of the first or the beginning of the second century of the Common Era."],"Harold Brodkey":["So an autobiography about death should include, in my case, an account of European Jewry and of Russian and Jewish events - pogroms and flights and murders and the revolution that drove my mother to come here.","It is death that goes down to the center of the earth, the great burial church the earth is, and then to the curved ends of the universe, as light is said to do.","It is like visiting one's funeral, like visiting loss in its purest and most monumental form, this wild darkness, which is not only unknown but which one cannot enter as oneself.","If you like to read, sometimes it's interesting just to go and see what the reality is, of the word, of the seedy or not so seedy fiction writer, the drunk or sober poet... Sometimes you can go looking for illumination.","Public radio is alive and kicking, it always has been.","I feel sorry for the man who marries you... because everyone thinks you're sweet and you're not.","This identity, this mind, this particular cast of speech, is nearly over.","Being ill like this combines shock - this time I will die - with a pain and agony that are unfamiliar, that wrench me out of myself.","Memory, so complete and clear or so evasive, has to be ended, has to be put aside, as if one were leaving a chapel and bringing the prayer to an end in one's head.","I awake with a not entirely sickened knowledge that I am merely young again and in a funny way at peace, an observer who is aware of time's chariot, aware that some metamorphosis has occurred.","I am in an adolescence in reverse, as mysterious as the first, except that this time I feel it as a decay of the odds that I might live for a while, that I can sleep it off.","Almost the first thing I did when I became ill was to buy a truly good television set.","Death and I are head to head in a total collision, pure and mutual distaste.","But death's acquisitive instincts will win.","I have thousands of opinions still - but that is down from millions - and, as always, I know nothing.","I am sensible of the velocity of the moments, and entering that part of my head alert to the motion of the world I am aware that life was never perfect, never absolute. This bestows contentment, even a fearlessness.","It bothers me that I won't live to see the end of the century, because, when I was young, in St. Louis, I remember saying to Marilyn, my sister by adoption, that that was how long I wanted to live: seventy years.","I look upon another's insistence on the merits of his or her life - duties, intellect, accomplishment - and see that most of it is nonsense.","True stories, autobiographical stories, like some novels, begin long ago, before the acts in the account, before the birth of some of the people in the tale.","In New York one lives in the moment rather more than Socrates advised, so that at a party or alone in your room it will always be difficult to guess at the long term worth of anything.","I was always crazy about New York, dependent on it, scared of it - well, it is dangerous - but beyond that there was the pressure of being young and of not yet having done work you really liked, trademark work, breakthrough work.","Me, my literary reputation is mostly abroad, but I am anchored here in New York. I can't think of any other place I'd rather die than here.","I can't change the past, and I don't think I would. I don't expect to be understood. I like what I've written, the stories and two novels. If I had to give up what I've written in order to be clear of this disease, I wouldn't do it.","God is an immensity, while this disease, this death, which is in me, this small, tightly defined pedestrian event, is merely and perfectly real, without miracle - or instruction."],"Harold Budd":["But that's fine, because I like to have control of the ambience.","Sometimes I write them down in musical notation as a trigger to remind me about certain directions to go. Or I can be specific about a sound I'm looking for.","When a piece is done, I mix it before going on to any other piece.","I had to get out of America to get a professional life going where I could actually make a living.","I'm not really a pianist.","I'm somebody who plays the piano... sometimes.","I felt Brighton was a perfect ending to a really interesting career."],"Harold Coffin":["Envy is the art of counting the other fellow's blessings instead of your own.","Behind every successful man you'll find a woman who has nothing to wear.","In the business world an executive knows something about everything, a technician knows everything about something and the switchboard operator knows everything.","Corporations cannot commit treason, or be outlawed or excommunicated, for they have no souls.","One often learns more from ten days of agony than from ten years of contentment.","A consumer is a shopper who is sore about something.","When the product is right, you don't have to be a great marketer.","Middle age is the awkward period when Father Time starts catching up with Mother Nature.","The fellow who thinks he knows it all is especially annoying to those of us who do.","The only thing worse than an active conscience is one that's retroactive."],"Harold E. Hughes":["I know no words of prayer - God help me because I can not help myself.","Let me die because I do not want to see the sun again.","A great sense of peace entered my body, and seemingly into every cell."],"Harold E. Varmus":["My ideal summer day was reading on the porch.","I begin with the premise that behavior is an incredibly important element in medicine. People's habits, their willingness to quit smoking, their willingness to take steps to avoid transmission of HIV, are all behavioral questions.","Just after graduation in 1966, like many of my contemporaries, I applied for research training at the National Institutes of Health. Perhaps because his wife was a poet, Ira Pastan agreed to take me into his laboratory, despite my lack of scientific credentials.","When I read about genetics, I see breakthroughs every day. And while I'm trying to learn more about behavioral science, I must say that I don't feel I get tremendous intellectual stimulation from most of the things I read.","I saw my friends in medical school seeming to be more engaged with the real world. That provoked a sort of jealousy, and I decided to go to medical school after all.","I had learned that science is a rewarding, active process of discovery, not the passive absorption of what others had discovered.","I had learned of Gertrude Stein's bon mot that medicine opened all doors. This prompted me, in different moods, to view my future life as literary psychiatrist, globe-trotting tropical disease specialist, or academic internist.","I was born in the shadow of World War II, on December 18, 1939, on the South Shore of Long Island, a product of the early -wentieth-century emigration of Eastern European Jewry to New York City and its environs.","Following graduation from Amherst, a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship enabled me to test the depth of my interest in literary scholarship by beginning graduate studies at Harvard University.","The public schools I attended were dominated by athletics and rarely inspiring intellectually, but I enjoyed a small circle of interesting friends despite my ineptitude at team sports and my preference for reading.","In preparation for a career in academic medicine, I worked as a medical house officer at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital from 1966 to 1968 and then joined Ira Pastan's laboratory at the National Institutes of Health as a Clinical Associate.","As an undergraduate at Amherst College, I was devoted to Dickensian novels and antiestablishment journalism while marginally fulfilling premedical requirements.","A major feature of life at the NIH in late 1960s was the extraordinary offering of evening courses for physicians attempting to become scientists as they neared thirty.","From some dilatory reading in the early 1960s, I knew enough about viruses and their association with tumors in animals to understand that they might provide a relatively simple entry into a problem as complex as cancer.","When I was the NIH director, I often expressed envy of institute directors: they had the money and ran the scientific programmes.","Cancer is a collection of many diseases with common principles, and each disease will have to be understood and more effectively controlled on its own terms.","The NCI scientific programme leaders meet regularly to ensure that we are not ignoring highly original proposals and that we are not creating an unbalanced grant portfolio.","All basic scientists who look to the NCI for funding should know that I will tolerate no retreat on the study of model systems and the pursuit of fundamental biological principles.","I'm used to being surrounded by really smart 22-year-old students who have no problem saying that something I suggested is not a very good idea.","I keep encouraging the pharmaceutical companies to put more money into R&D.","Our biggest single theme is trying to make the NIH work better with the same amount of money.","When high school students ask to spend their afternoons and weekends in my laboratory, I am amazed: I didn't develop that kind of enthusiasm for science until I was 28 years old.","Anyone graduating from medical school in 1966 had first to fulfill military service before launching a career. Fiercely opposed to the Vietnam War, I sought to avoid it through an assignment to the Public Health Service.","Tobacco, UV rays, viruses, heredity, and age are the main causes of cancer.","Some growths can be detected early, making for increased accuracy in diagnosis. Some can be cured and others controlled.","In the 1960s and '70s, there wasn't much evidence at all. We knew vaguely the causes of cancer, but methods like genomics were very new.","Science can improve lives in ways that are elegant in design and moving in practice.","In general, all cancers have been traditionally characterized by the way they appear under the microscope and the organs in which they arise.","Every cancer looks different. Every cancer has similarities to other cancers. And we're trying to milk those differences and similarities to do a better job of predicting how things are going to work out and making new drugs.","I believe that we are going to have a much deeper appreciation of what kinds of abnormalities in cancer cells and in the surrounding cells that feed and respond to cancers are vulnerabilities that will allow us to make better predictions of which kinds of drugs will work to treat these cancers."],"Harold Edward Holt":["Australians were unique due to our corals, our apples, our gum trees and our kangaroos.","The marshalling of those resources in order to obtain the maximum war effort for Australia, and a maximum degree of help and cooperation for Great Britain and the sister Dominions, is the primary objective of the new Department."],"Harold Evans":["Attempting to get at truth means rejecting stereotypes and cliches.","The camera cannot lie, but it can be an accessory to untruth.","In journalism it is simpler to sound off than it is to find out. It is more elegant to pontificate than it is to sweat.","For 50 years my father worked for the railroad.","I think America has a brilliant future.","Throughout America's young history there has been a necessary tension between the individual and the group.","When I first came to the United States in 1956 I fell in love with things - mainly the vitality and the freedoms.","Actions are always more complex and nuanced than they seem. We have to be willing to wrestle with paradox in pursuing understanding."],"Harold Feinstein":["I love this life. I feel like I am always catching my breath and saying, 'Oh! Will you look at that?' Photography has been my way of bearing witness to the joy I find in seeing the extraordinary in ordinary life. You don't look for pictures. Your pictures are looking for you.","I always feel I had a very lucky life. For example, I sure didn't want to go in the army: when I was drafted in the Korean War, I wanted to go as a photographer. But luckily, they put me in the infantry - luckily because the official photographer was photographing the medal awarding and all the official situations.","You must photograph where you are involved; where you are overwhelmed by what you see before you; where you hold your breath while releasing the shutter, not because you are afraid of jarring the camera, but because you are seeing with your guts wide open to the sweet pain of an image that is part of your life.","I was drawn to street photography because there are pictures everywhere there: a woman holding a dog, a baby screaming to be put in a pram, kids playing punch ball, stores with huge barrels of kosher pickles outside. I wanted to photograph life, and here it was.","Coney Island was the centre of the world for me. I loved the rides, the hot dogs - I've never gotten over it.","The thing is that pictures are everywhere. The question is what we don't see, and why don't we see so much. I just see it.","I began photographing in 1946. Before that, I was a painter and drawer, with my mother and father's support. They were a bit pissed when I went into photography. They thought photographers were guys who took pictures at weddings.","I was born in Coney Island. I like to think I fell out of the womb onto the fun park's giant Parachute Jump while eating a Nathan's hot dog.","Mostly, I worked so quickly, I didn't see the details of a photograph until it was printed.","Coney Island is and always will be 'the people's playground.' It's a place where people of all backgrounds come to have a good time.","The only time I've ever really felt envy is when I've watched people make music, which made my time living in the now-legendary Jazz Loft at 821 Sixth Avenue in New York a constant source of agony and ecstasy!"],"Harold Ford, Jr.":["If you don't meet the standards, then you don't qualify.","I am a Yankees fan. I should say - have been to more Yankees games than Mets games.","These are tough times, and the New Yorkers I have met are facing economic adversity with grace and dignity. They worry about their future, care about their neighbors and hope this storm will pass so they can focus on better days ahead.","I am for gay marriage. Or same-sex marriage. I don't want to say it the wrong way. I think people are sensitive to it. I have been painted as being this right-wing zealot on choice. Nothing could be further from the truth.","The idea is a straightforward one. We provide an account for every newborn in America, a $500 account.","If you are born into a family below the national median income, we provide you with an additional $500, and for every contribution made to a child's account below the national median income, we match it dollar for dollar - the federal government will.","I look forward to the day that a lot of the folks that you all talk about and cover on this network will begin to market products for these families and for these kids coming out of junior high school and high school all across the country.","So we have broad bipartisan support for the bill, and it's my hope that we can build on some of the things that have been talked about in Washington involving building a larger ownership society.","The reality is we talk a lot about it, but we really don't give everyone an opportunity to buy into it, and this combines both the best of Republican and Democratic ideals.","Republicans believe largely in the market working, Democrats believe stereotypically that you've got to give people something. So why not give people a chance to let the market work for them.","If your kids attend school and grades are up that will make $1,000 contributions to some 10,000 kids across the country, are challenging kids to learn foreign languages or challenging kids to get summer jobs or seek summer enrichment opportunities?","I think the potential for the program at the risk of sounding self-serving is large, some would say even limitless, so I'm excited about it and I think it can even pass next year.","The bureaucracy is not great. I don't think Rick Santorum who is not one for being a big proponent of large bureaucracies would be as enthusiastic a supporter of it.","I think the country is very settled in a lot of ways, and we saw that after the Democratic Convention. I think a lot of the bump that we enjoyed came when John Kerry selected John Edwards as his running mate.","I expect the Republicans will enjoy a large bounce out of their convention. They're here wrapping themselves in the 9/11 flag, which I think is inappropriate in many ways, but it's their choice.","I firmly believe that as voters come to learn more and more about John Kerry and learn more and more about his message that they're going to want a President who is willing to address the fact that we didn't have a post-war plan in Iraq.","I look forward to their convention and look forward to hearing the President talk about what he will do for the next four years. He hasn't done it up to this point.","You've got to either say you're going to cut taxes and find some spending cuts. I think we ought to reform long-term entitlement spending in the country, but you can't out of one side of your mouth say, 'Yes, we're for tax cuts, we're for spending discipline, and we're for bringing down the debt.'","I'm a capitalist. I believe that people take risk, and there are rewards if they do well; they should lose if they don't.","I was for civil unions and believed strongly that the flow of benefits and protections that would be provided in a civil union for same-sex couples, the decisions that have to be made, when health hardships are faced, when economic hardships are faced, I wanted all of those protections. I never strayed from them.","I am a huge supporter for cash for caulkers - which allows people to make improvement for energy efficient in their homes. We should do the same for Americans purchasing appliances and computers and for that matter, new air-conditioner and heating units.","I refuse to do anything that would help Republicans win a Senate seat in New York, and give the Senate majority to the Republicans.","I am not going to stop speaking out on behalf of policies that I think are right - regardless of ideology, party or political expediency.","I am a Democrat. But I am an independent Democrat.","I love New York, I love the smell of New York... I love the subway.","Killing terrorists is cheaper than capturing them.","As America's head coach, President Obama needs to make some big and smart adjustments to jump-start economic growth and business investment, stimulate job creation, and get wages up for ordinary Americans.","The U.S. economy and workers benefit from a strong, healthy relationship between government and business.","One bipartisan policy tradition is to deny Americans the use of our own resources.","Lawmakers misrepresent the facts when they call the manufacturing deduction known as Section 199 - passed by Congress in 2004 to spur domestic job growth - a 'subsidy' for oil and gas firms. The truth is that all U.S. manufacturers, from software producers to filmmakers and coffee roasters, are eligible for this deduction.","My appetite for public policy and changing it, and not only being a part of the conversation, but affecting it in a positive way, never diminished after 10 years in Congress.","I often have said to people that there are really two cities in the country where the outlook is always forward-looking - there is never really a backward-looking tendency. My banking work has taken me out to Palo Alto, what is commonly called Silicon Valley. And you sense out there is always a forward-looking outlook. And New York City.","I don't think it's a great leap to go from civil unions to gay marriage - I may be in the minority in believing that.","To say that I am pro life is just wrong. I am personally pro-choice and legislatively pro-choice.","I think if you socialize, dine with, spend time with known terrorists that are on the list of those who want to do harm to America, you put yourself in peril. I don't dine, socialize or spend time with people who are on the terrorist lists.","I either run or try to play basketball every day.","I'm in an interracial marriage.","I'm not comparing myself to Bobby Kennedy by any stretch, but he was opposed by the liberal establishment, too. Eleanor Roosevelt was the biggest opponent to him running.","My dad was a congressman, and he taught me at a very early age, 'They voted for me, they view me as theirs, and I am.' Our family's phone in Memphis was always listed. It rang all day and all night.","Public service is a part of who I am, having grown up in a family of politicians.","Some say I was disappointed when President Obama won, and that is absolute nonsense."],"Harold H. Greene":["With competition everyone has to try harder.","You can't just lecture the poor that they shouldn't riot or go to extremes. You have to make the means of legal redress available.","The Sherman Act is similar in the economics sphere to the Bill of Rights in the personal sphere.","Mandatory sentencing guidelines have become as complicated and detailed as the IRS code!","I don't think a judge should be too much involved in outside activities.","The attorney general would call at 5 o'clock in the evening and say: 'Tomorrow morning we are going to try to integrate the University of Mississippi. Get us a memo on what we're likely to do, and what we can do if the governor sends the National Guard there.'","The traditional practice is that the justices don't ask the attorney general any questions, so as not to embarrass him. But Bobby Kennedy had let them know that he didn't mind if they asked him questions and they did.","I could see flames from the windows of my chambers. For the next three or four days we had major rioting here in Washington and I stayed at the court day and night.","The testimony and the documentary evidence produced by the Government demonstrate that the Bell System had violated the antitrust laws in a number of ways over a lengthy period of time.","I'm a great believer in the competitive system, and think that competition will bring us greater innovation and put American industry in information ahead of everyone also.","They say I am a regulator and I think it is just an effort not to comply with the decree. I do not do anything except what the decree requires me to do.","For a while, even in the house of good friends for dinner or for cocktails, they would really be upset. They thought I had single-handedly destroyed the best phone service in the world.","I took the position from day one that it was the right decree, that the modifications I made to the decree were proper, that the correct outcome had been obtained, and that in due time all of that would become apparent. And it has become apparent.","There would be nights when I would wake up and couldn't get back to sleep. So I would go downstairs and write. The staff had a pool going on how many pages of typing I would bring in here in the morning.","If members of the security apparatus could, with impunity, keep from those elected by the people that which they're entitled to know - or worse, feed false information - those who could control the classified data could be the real decision makers.","People are intimidated in court, and I try to make them more comfortable.","I think it does work. The fact that the law is there and injustices can be rectified, I think has a lot to do with the fact that the people in this country aren't as frustrated as they are in some of these places in Eastern Europe and don't resort to violent revolution.","The real difference between the United States and other nations lies not in the words of the preamble to the Constitution, but in the fact that the substantive clauses of that Constitution are enforced by individuals independent of and not beholden to the elected branches.","Every one of the world's dictatorships can and does claim to be acting in the name of the people.","The impression I have of Justice Warren is that he was looking for the just result in a case regardless of fixed dogma or principles and I like to think that I'm in that mold.","The enforcement of the law cannot depend on the justice of a cause or one man's conscience.","Frequently you have a clash between the more sterile letter of the law and the justice that underlies it, and I think one of the things I've been trying more or less, where it was possible, is to go with the justice rather than the letter of the law.","I liked discussion and debate and thought that these skills fit well with law. I also had an interest in justice - and later learned that sometimes law and justice actually agree!","I enjoyed the administrative work because it involved working with Congress, city council, and the mayor. I had never been a politician so it was fun - learning political maneuvering.","Defendants are being evaluated based on numerical grid without any aggravating circumstances being considered. The effect has been to transfer the disparity from the judge to the prosecutor allowing for a great deal of leeway on indictments.","I don't want to be influenced by outside opinion.","Once I was standing in line to buy a telephone and Senator Wirth was in line with me. The next day the New York Times reported that we'd both purchased telephones and what price we'd paid!","Competition is good and has served us well."],"Harold Hamm":["President Trump will release America's pent-up energy potential, get rid of foreign oil, trash punitive regulations, create millions of jobs, and develop our most strategic geopolitical weapon: crude oil.","I started working in the oilfield upon graduating high school. I was on the service end of it, driving tank trucks for Johnny Geer for a couple years and learning about oil and gas production. I had a whole cadre of mentors.","Anti-frackers are disingenuous. They bow to the religion of environmentalism.","Exporting oil would not drive up prices at the pump. American drivers buy refined products, which the U.S. already exports. Many studies - from a range of institutions and government agencies, including the Congressional Budget Office and the Energy Information Administration - have shown that lifting the export ban could actually lower gas prices.","No matter what, you've got to always follow your passion in life and always keep learning.","President Obama is riding the wrong horse on energy.","I always wanted to find oil. It was always an irresistible calling.","I'm a professional geologist, an explorationist for oil. That's what I've done in my career, one that's culminated in - at least to this point - playing a part in finding the largest field in the last 40 years anywhere in the world. That's the Bakken field, which I believe will yield 24 billion barrels of oil in the decades to come, maybe more.","It's harder, but we're still finding oil in Oklahoma today. The bar has been raised on startup companies, but it can still be done. Every regulation and every rule limits you, but, yes, it can still be done. That's the beauty of living in a free country and having the freedom to have an idea and become an entrepreneur.","The oil patch pays good. They're decent jobs paying between 50 and 70 thousand a year. Fracking has a big impact on the oil consumption in the United States.","A commodity producer should be comfortable being exposed to prices.","Every time we can't drill a well in America, terrorism is being funded. Every onerous regulation puts American lives at risk.","I grew up on a farm in Lexington, Oklahoma, a rural community south of Norman. My family moved to Enid, Oklahoma, in 1962, when I was a junior in high school. This cast me into a totally different environment. Enid was a company town for Champlin Petroleum, and there was an oil boom going on.","Oil is ancient wealth in the ground.","I love nature. I'm not going to do anything to detract from it.","Business people across the world are seeing the possibility of Donald Trump being president, and this is a big thing that I believe is inspiring people to put money here in America instead of Germany or other places where we have lot of things going on.","Certainly, Continental has taken advantage of pipe and sponsored pipeline projects where we could. As a historic shipper, we have put a lot of oil on pipe. We have over half of our oil on pipe coming out of the Bakken. We feel good about that."],"Harold Kushner":["Caring about others, running the risk of feeling, and leaving an impact on people, brings happiness.","When you carry out acts of kindness you get a wonderful feeling inside. It is as though something inside your body responds and says, yes, this is how I ought to feel.","I am convinced that it is not the fear of death, of our lives ending that haunts our sleep so much as the fear... that as far as the world is concerned, we might as well never have lived.","I think of life as a good book. The further you get into it, the more it begins to make sense."],"Harold Larwood":["Down the mine I dreamed of cricket; I bowled imaginery balls in the dark; I sent the stumps spinning and heard them rattling in the tunnels. No mishap was going to stop me from bowling in the real game, especially this one.","In my first season I took 76 wickets at an average of less than 5 runs.","Cricket was my reason for living.","I must have made a good impression because a club official to us into his office and asked me if I would sign on for a year with a view to becoming a professional."],"Harold MacMillan":["It has been said that there is no fool like an old fool, except a young fool. But the young fool has first to grow up to be an old fool to realize what a damn fool he was when he was a young fool.","Marxism is like a classical building that followed the Renaissance; beautiful in its way, but incapable of growth.","Once the bear's hug has got you, it is apt to be for keeps.","He is forever poised between a cliche and an indiscretion.","In long experience I find that a man who trusts nobody is apt to be the kind of man nobody trusts.","To be alive at all involves some risk.","I was determined that no British government should be brought down by the action of two tarts.","I have never found, in a long experience of politics, that criticism is ever inhibited by ignorance.","A man who trusts nobody is apt to be the kind of man nobody trusts.","At home, you always have to be a politician; when you're abroad, you almost feel yourself a statesman.","Memorial services are the cocktail parties of the geriatric set.","When the curtain falls, the best thing an actor can do is to go away.","There might be 1 finger on the trigger, but there will be 15 fingers on the safety catch.","Britain's most useful role is somewhere between bee and dinosaur.","It's no use crying over spilt summits.","I was a sort of son to Ike, and it was the other way round with Kennedy.","If people want a sense of purpose they should get it from their archbishop. They should certainly not get it from their politicians.","No man should ever lose sleep over public affairs.","Tradition does not mean that the living are dead, it means that the dead are living.","I read a great number of press reports and find comfort in the fact that they are nearly always conflicting.","It is the duty of Her Majesty's government neither to flap nor to falter.","If you don't believe in God, all you have to believe in is decency. Decency is very good. Better decent than indecent. But I don't think it's enough.","We have not overthrown the divine right of kings to fall down for the divine right of experts.","As usual the Liberals offer a mixture of sound and original ideas. Unfortunately none of the sound ideas is original and none of the original ideas is sound.","Power? It's like a Dead Sea fruit. When you achieve it, there is nothing there.","(A Foreign Secretary) is forever poised between the cliche and the indiscretion."],"Harold Nicholas":["I copied my brother. He was a natural dancer. Graceful. People always asked did we study ballet. We never did.","If you were black, you experienced prejudice. It wasn't a real horrible thing for us; we went through it. We noticed it mostly in the South and in Las Vegas, where we couldn't stay in the hotels where we entertained. But that began to change."],"Harold Nicolson":["The Irish do not want anyone to wish them well; they want everyone to wish their enemies ill.","The great secret of a successful marriage is to treat all disasters as incidents and none of the incidents as disasters.","We are all inclined to judge ourselves by our ideals; others by their acts.","The gift of broadcasting is, without question, the lowest human capacity to which any man could attain."],"Harold Perrineau":["You want to be on your toes; You don't want to be in a Nic Cage movie and just have him blow by you as an actor.","The music is just so rich and part of the culture there. I suddenly felt like I needed to go on this mission to make sure we save New Orleans because - not that I can save anything - but it's so much part of what this country is, this whole mix of people coming together and doing this thing.","I was just mind-blown to find that New Orleans is just so much more fun and interesting than I had ever thought.","Before I went to New Orleans, I was a little scared of New Orleans. I don't know why. I had only been there a few times. Something about it made me feel nervous, knowing a bit about the history.","I get to hang out with people I think are awesome, and do work I think is awesome. It's really cool."],"Harold Pinter":["Drama happens in big cricket matches. But also in small cricket matches.","It's so easy for propaganda to work, and dissent to be mocked.","I left school at sixteen - I was fed up and restless. The only thing that interested me at school was English language and literature, but I didn't have Latin, and so couldn't go on to university. So I went to a few drama schools, not studying seriously; I was mostly in love at the time and tied up with that.","Cricket, the whole thing, playing, watching, being part of the Gaieties, has been a central feature of my life.","I tend to think that cricket is the greatest thing that God ever created on earth - certainly greater than sex, although sex isn't too bad either.","Only by the sweat of my own brow. I am a totally working man.","A character on stage who can present no convincing argument or information as to his past experience, his present behaviour or his aspirations, nor give a comprehensive analysis of his motives, is as legitimate and as worthy of attention as one who, alarmingly, can do all these things.","There are no hard distinctions between what is real and what is unreal, nor between what is true and what is false. A thing is not necessarily either true or false; it can be both true and false.","Quite often, I have a compelling sense of how a role should be played. And I'm proved - equally as often - quite wrong.","Political theatre presents an entirely different set of problems. Sermonising has to be avoided at all cost. Objectivity is essential. The characters must be allowed to breathe their own air. The author cannot confine and constrict them to satisfy his own taste or disposition or prejudice.","Truth in drama is forever elusive. You never quite find it, but the search for it is compulsive. The search is clearly what drives the endeavour. The search is your task.","Sometimes you feel you have the truth of a moment in your hand, then it slips through your fingers and is lost.","I'm well aware that I have been described in some quarters as being 'enigmatic, taciturn, prickly, explosive and forbidding'. Well, I have my moods like anyone else; I won't deny it.","The whole brunt of the media and the government is to encourage people to be highly competitive and totally selfish and uncaring of others.","I never think of myself as wise. I think of myself as possessing a critical intelligence which I intend to allow to operate.","I was brought up in the War. I was an adolescent in the Second World War. And I did witness in London a great deal of the Blitz.","There's a tradition in British intellectual life of mocking any non-political force that gets involved in politics, especially within the sphere of the arts and the theatre.","George W. Bush is always protesting that he has the fate of the world in mind and bangs on about the 'freedom-loving peoples' he's seeking to protect. I'd love to meet a freedom-hating people.","I'm always the interrogator. When I was an actor in rep, I always played sinister parts. The directors always said, 'If there's a nasty man about, cast Harold Pinter.'","I mean, don't forget the earth's about five thousand million years old, at least. Who can afford to live in the past?","One's life has many compartments.","I also found being called Sir rather silly.","The Companion of Honour I regarded as an award from the country for 50 years of work - which I thought was okay.","It was difficult being a conscientious objector in the 1940's, but I felt I had to stick to my guns.","I used to get up at five in the morning and play cricket.","I don't idealise women. I enjoy them. I have been married to two of the most independent women it is possible to think of.","I've said it before, and I'll say it again. I've written 29 damn plays. Isn't that enough?","You have to hand it to America. It has exercised a quite clinical manipulation of power worldwide while masquerading as a force for universal good.","Quite simply, my writing life has been one of relish, challenge, excitement.","The past is what you remember, imagine you remember, convince yourself you remember, or pretend you remember.","The crimes of the U.S. throughout the world have been systematic, constant, clinical, remorseless, and fully documented but nobody talks about them.","Apart from the known and the unknown, what else is there?","One way of looking at speech is to say it is a constant stratagem to cover nakedness.","Good writing excites me, and makes life worth living.","A short piece of work means as much to me as a long piece of work.","I don't think there's been any writer like Samuel Beckett. He's unique. He was a most charming man and I used to send him my plays.","I ought not to speak about the dead because the dead are all over the place.","I think that NATO is itself a war criminal.","My second play, The Birthday Party, I wrote in 1958 - or 1957. It was totally destroyed by the critics of the day, who called it an absolute load of rubbish.","Occasionally it does hit me, the words on a page. And I still love doing that, as I have for the last 60 years.","One is and is not in the centre of the maelstrom of it all.","The Room I wrote in 1957, and I was really gratified to find that it stood up. I didn't have to change a word.","There are some good rules and there are some lousy rules.","Iraq is just a symbol of the attitude of western democracies to the rest of the world.","I was told that, when 'Betrayal' was being produced by one of the provincial companies in England, the two actors playing those roles actually went into a pub one day and played that scene as if it were really happening to them. The people around them became very uncomfortable.","All that happens is that the destruction of human beings - unless they're Americans - is called collateral damage.","Most of the press is in league with government, or with the status quo.","Analysis I take to be a scientific procedure. What I do is creative. It doesn't spring from the same part of the mind.","My father was a tailor. He worked from seven o'clock in the morning until seven at night. At least when he got home, my mother always cooked him a very good dinner. Lots of potatoes, I remember; he used to knock them down like a dose of salts. He needed it, after a 12-hour day.","All I can say is that I did admire 'The Lives of Others', which I thought was really about something and beautifully done.","Clinton's hands remain incredibly clean, don't they, and Tony Blair's smile remains as wide as ever. I view these guises with profound contempt.","Beckett had an unerring light on things, which I much appreciated.","I believe an international criminal court is very much to be desired.","I could be a bit of a pain in the arse. Since I've come out of my cancer, I must say I intend to be even more of a pain in the arse.","I don't intend to simply go away and write my plays and be a good boy. I intend to remain an independent and political intelligence in my own right.","I found the offer of a knighthood something that I couldn't possibly accept. I found it to be somehow squalid, a knighthood. There's a relationship to government about knights.","I think it is the responsibility of a citizen of any country to say what he thinks.","If Milosevic is to be tried, he has to be tried by a proper court, an impartial, properly constituted court which has international respect.","There is a movement to get an international criminal court in the world, voted for by hundreds of states-but with the noticeable absence of the United States of America.","This particular nurse said, Cancer cells are those which have forgotten how to die. I was so struck by this statement.","While The United States is the most powerful nation the world has ever seen, it is also the most detested nation that the world has ever known.","My first play was 'The Room', written when I was twenty-seven.","I wrote 'The Room', 'The Birthday Party', and 'The Dumb Waiter' in 1957, I was acting all the time in a repertory company, doing all kinds of jobs, traveling to Bournemouth and Torquay and Birmingham.","I've never been able to understand what they mean by 'Pinteresque,'. I'm sure it's indefinable.","I think plays have nothing to do with one's own personal life. Not in my experience, anyway. The stuff of drama has to do, not with your subject matter, anyway, but with how you treat it. Drama includes pain, loss, regret - that's what drama is about!","The only theatre I ever saw was Shakespeare.","A few friends and me used to go and watch Bunuel, Carne, Cocteau... Cocteau and Bunuel were surrealism. And I was very excited by that. 'Un Chien Andalou', especially.","One should also remember that the U.S. is the biggest exporter of torture weapons in the world, though the U.K. is not far behind in the league table. We never stopped, even under Robin Cook's supposedly ethical foreign policy.","All I'm saying is that there are many different kinds of political theatre and many plays I greatly admire: 'Antigone,' 'Mother Courage,' 'All My Sons.' But, if I tackle a political theme, I have to do it in my own way.","I always start a play by calling the characters A, B, and C.","I am absolutely not saying that Milosevic might not be responsible for all sorts of atrocities, but I believe that what's been left out of public debate and the press is that there was a civil war going on there.","I find the whole Blairish idea more and more repugnant every day. 'New Labour': the term itself is so trashy. Kind of ersatz.","I certainly feel sad about the alienation from my son.","Things like Abu Ghraib and even Guantanamo are not new things: there are many precedents.","There was one man in the Labour government, Robin Cook, whom I had a very high regard for. He had the courage to speak out and to resign over Iraq. He was an admirable man. But resignation over a matter of principle is not a very fashionable thing in our society.","I don't make judgments about my own work, and I don't analyze it; I just let it happen. That applies to everything I've done.","I do tend to think that I've written a great deal out of my unconscious because half the time I don't know what a given character is going to say next.","The effect of depleted uranium, used by America in the Gulf War, is never referred to.","I'll tell you something, and this is true: I've never been able to write a film which I didn't respect. I just can't do it. I'm very happy about all the films I haven't done.","It's such a delicate business, the structure of film, isn't it? What happens if a scene is not there but two minutes later? It's an eternal, never-ending search, actually, which is very exciting. It really is.","No one wanted me to be a conscientious objector. My parents certainly didn't want it. My teacher and mentor, Joe Brearley, didn't want it. My friends didn't want it. I was alone.","Many Americans, we know, are horrified by the posture of their government but seem to be helpless.","As far as I'm concerned, 'The Caretaker' is funny up to a point. Beyond that, it ceases to be funny, and it was because of that point that I wrote it."],"Harold Prince":["I always liked the visuals to be choice and at the same time minimalist. And, I love black boxes. After all, that's what theatre is, it's an empty space, and it's both limited and unlimited because the space is the space, but what you can do with people's imaginations is really endless.","Collaboration is just, really, a group of people getting in a room with their eye on a very similar prize and wanting to come out with the same show. The director, ultimately, is the guy in front of whom the buck stops. So, he has to have the courage to prevail. But, he has got to have a huge amount of respect for his collaborators.","Nobody has yet proven that taking a chance and doing something unique that an audience isn't used to is a bad idea. What the theater lacks is that kind of courage.","I really don't spend time thinking about the past. I think about the future. I'm not stopping.","I like to do everything you can possibly do before you go into rehearsal, because once we are in rehearsal or on the stage there will be a problem I didn't anticipate. It's really good to think we got it all nailed - of course you've never got it all nailed.","What's missing in the musical theater is producers willing to nurture new work, raise the money and put it on.","I feel so much more comfortable when I'm working on material which makes other people scratch their heads and ask, 'You're going to make a musical out of that?'","I wouldn't be here if it weren't for 'Show Boat.' The kind of theater I chose to be involved in is completely a direct reflection of what 'Show Boat' made possible.","I would like to see more new productions of new material by new composers/lyricists/book writers. I would like to see people take more chances. I think because everything costs so much they're not taking the chances they used to.","I think when you start analyzing trends and start making shows for a particular audience, you are making a fatal move. I think that's why people are doing too many revivals, that's why there's a plethora of rock musicals. There's room for everything, but not room for too much of anything.","Artistic self-indulgence is the mark of an amateur. The temptation to make scenes, to appear late, to call in sick, not to meet deadlines, not to be organized, is at heart a sign of your own insecurity and at worst the sign of an amateur.","I don't look back. I look forward and plan new shows. That's really feeding the most important part of working in the theater.","I saw 'On The Town' about nine times. I discovered it. I loved it. I was in college.","Lyrics can't do what they do - or should do - when you're creating a musical with rock lyrics. There's plenty of room for rock musicals, just not all rock musicals.","The idea is to work and to experiment. Some things will be creatively successful, some things will succeed at the box office, and some things will only - which is the biggest only - teach you things that see the future. And they're probably as valuable as any of your successes.","I was nine. I saw Orson Welles in 'Julius Caesar.' It was involving, emotional, imaginative. I've never forgotten it.","I've always loved Victorian melodrama. And I've always liked larger-than-life theater, providing it's truthful and honest. I like what the theater can provide in energy and bombast - I enjoy it when it's large, and by that I don't mean in size, I mean in emotions. Shakespeare did that.","A star may guarantee business, but the tradeoff is a very short run.","There's no lack of talent out there. I suspect there is a lack of creative guidance, and that would not be solely the responsibility of a director but also a producer.","Producing should be a creative responsibility.","You think, 'Musicals, they must always be romantic' - You'd be surprised how few of them historically have ever been romantic.","Producers want to put their music behind revivals but I don't think that's a good trend for the theater at all.","Audiences are very willing to be taken somewhere, and to ask an audience beforehand what it wants is probably, I think, a mistake. Much better you should tell them what you want and hope they agree with it.","There have always been revivals. Some have always been successful. And many of them have failed.","The musical has always been in jeopardy - until - or was in jeopardy until it was realised that it is probably the safest living theatre art form.","'Showboat' is the quintessential family show.","I've never been able to understand where great artists come from.","I wouldn't want to be just pigeonholed as an extravagant director.","I got successful awfully quick, and I wanted it... But I do think there is responsibility to move the musical theater form forward. I think you always have to be aware of the work that came before and build on that.","I don't like abrasion while I'm working. I don't thrive on chaos. I enjoy what I'm doing, and it seems to work better when I am enjoying it.","Most of the big money people don't know what would interest an audience if you did it. They only know what interested the audience last time.","The idea that I have to be on the same side of the fence as Dan Quayle is cruelly depressing to me, but the truth is, I believe in family values.","You can't just keep recycling revivals. And you can't keep betting on the efforts of guys like me who've been around. You have to take the next step and bet on the next generation.","Audiences are quite happy to be astonished, and they don't care who does that astonishing.","I've seen a lot of 'Show Boats,' but I've never seen the one that thoroughly satisfies me.","When I started producing, it was George Abbott directing and he would let me do the scenery. He just wanted to know where the doors were - the entrances, the exits; the tables, the props - and then I would hire the designer. I took charge of the visuals - scenery and costumes and so on. And, the shows looked wonderful.","Throwing money at something doesn't really create - forgive me that onerous word - art.","I don't compare shows. It's very simple. I don't live in the past. If there's any secret to my longevity, it's living in the future. And a little bit in the present.","I'm always glad to see somebody rethink something rather than reproduce something I did.","You do a show to be a hit and hopefully run a couple of years.","I remember when people actually wore coats and ties to theatre every night. They don't anymore. It's very different.","I always had a good time in theatre, even when shows don't turn out as well as I'd like.","I'm just really trying to say what I really mean, which is: 'Your eye's on the prize, your eye's on the future. It's nice to know that a lot of wonderful things have happened to your life and that so much of it has been successful. That's great, but the work is really what makes it fun - and that has to be the future.'","The perfect expression of receiving a lifetime award is to be working when they're handing it out.","I'm on a single track here - I work to direct what I want to see onstage. I basically have been feeding my own needs - to be working on a specific project at a specific time, and fortunately more often it works than fails.","It's fine when you careen off disasters and terrifyingly bad reviews and rejection and all that stuff when you're young; your resilience is just terrific.","You could argue that 'Sweeney Todd' was romantic, if you looked closely at it, but it didn't impart that to its audiences. But it's large, and it's melodramatic, and it's a style I like to work in periodically.","Criticism is valuable... and self-congratulatory experiences are not.","Everything can't be a postage-stamp-sized project. Everything can't be a chamber piece. Musicals aren't even meant to be that, or identified with it... It's none of it simple.","I love big, bold, truthful theater - the tradition of Victorian theater.","I was there when the quote-unquote golden age of musical theater was flourishing. I met everybody who worked in theater or was famous in theater from the '40s on.","I really like reaching out and seeing the audience - they're potential audiences! And on occasion I can make them excited about going to the theater again, if they've ceased or gone less.","It's nice to stay up nights worrying about the material, and not about the investors who gave you $10 million to do your musical.","I'm crazy about Dublin. If you went back 3,000 years in my ancestry you wouldn't find a drop of Irish blood in the veins, but I love the place.","I suppose a certain degree of adulthood has entered my life. Aiming for Broadway, I can't think that way any more. Of course, Broadway will always be important. But it's not the focus of everything that you do. You know, I'm very happy I was born when I was, so I got there in time. When it was time to get there.","Despite the successes, you remember the failures - rather lovingly.","There was never any question that I would go to college, that I would travel, that I would go to the theater early and often.","I didn't go into the theater to be a producer, I went into the theater to be a director.","One thing is certain: We can't go back. The musical will never be the same as it was.","'Evita' was four pieces of slick paper and a record album. It's the most scary, to sit down and dictate a musical scene by scene. It was a musical unlike anything I'd ever seen before myself.","The truth of the matter is that I have lasted a long time, and with it comes both good and bad things. One of the good things is that no one can ever take my career away from me. No one can ever say, 'You can't be in the theater any more.'","All these actors who died before I was born, all the theaters and the artistic movements - all that stuff fills you up and makes you feel like you're the inheritor of all this information and of all its passion.","I don't know why the guys with the big money don't find five terrific young producers and give each of them enough to commission a musical and to live on for a year. You'd be likely to get at least one project with a future.","When I was a 25-year-old kid, I raised $260,000 for my first show, 'The Pajama Game,' in such a homemade, pathetic, endearing way - a buck here, a buck there.","There are wonderful composers and librettists out there. It's the lack of creative producers that is troubling.","We've got to find a way to protect the process of making musical theater.","Ethel Merman would stay with a show for years and tour with it. So would Mary Martin, the great stars. They recognized the value of that success and nurtured it. Now, you come from Hollywood, you play 12 weeks and go away. I don't think that's the best policy.","I really wish people - maybe it's naive - wish people had priorities and were willing to be artistic patrons.","I don't think there's a defined contemporary American musical, do you?","The truth is, for some absurd reason, no one is willing to admit that the interests of the producers and the theater owners are not the same."],"Harold Ramis":["I never work just to work. It's some combination of laziness and self-respect.","How one handles success or failure is determined by their early childhood.","My only conclusion about structure is that nothing works if you don't have interesting characters and a good story to tell.","My characters aren't losers. They're rebels. They win by their refusal to play by everyone else's rules.","No matter what I have to say, I'm still trying to say it in comedic form.","We all wish we could be in more than one place at the same time. People with families feel guilty all the time-if we spend too much time with our family, we feel we're not working hard enough.","My job is to come up with something that you like and you agree with that you would play wholeheartedly. If we disagree, I may not be doing my job correctly.","If Chevy Chase had not been an actor, he might have been a very popular guy in advertising, or whatever field he would have gone into, because of his charisma.","Whenever a critic mentions the salary of an actor, I'm thinking, He's not talking about the movie.","I had a dream cast when Dan first went off and wrote 'Ghostbusters 3' by himself. It was so long ago that my dream cast was Ben Stiller, Chris Farley, and Chris Rock. That would have been cool. Now, a lot of time has passed, and there are a lot of young funny people.","I never read Playboy before I started working there and stopped reading it the day I quit.","The best description of the Old Testament that I heard was that it starts out as mythology, then it becomes legend, then it becomes history. In the mythological period - there is a distinct mythological period in the Old Testament, where the time spans are impossible and really just imagined.","If life only has the meaning you bring to it, we have the opportunity to bring rich meaning to our lives by the service we do for others.","Nothing reinforces a professional relationship more than enjoying success with someone.","Acting is all about big hair and funny props... All the great actors knew it. Olivier knew it, Brando knew it.","A psychologist said to me, there are only two important questions you have to ask yourself. What do you really feel? And, what do you really want? If you can answer those two, you probably can leave your neuroses behind you.","As much as we'd like to believe that our work is great and that we're infallible, we're not. Hollywood movies are made for the audience. These are not small European art films we're making.","Billy Crystal knows how to make people laugh. He's got 30 years on stage... there's no telling him what's funny.","First and foremost, you have to make the movie for yourself. And that's not to say, to hell with everyone else, but what else have you got to go on but your own taste and judgment?","I always claim that the writer has done 90 percent of the director's work.","I believe things happen that can't be explained, but so many people seem intent on explaining them. Everyone has an answer for them. Either aliens or things from the spirit world.","I feel a big obligation to the audience, almost in a moral sense, to say something useful. If I'm going to spend a year of my life on these things, I want something that I feel that strongly about.","I had a lot of fun working with John Candy. We had a pretty good rapport.","I used to be married to a woman who pursued every spiritual trend with tremendous passion and dragged me along. I don't believe in anything. I'd seen mediums and readers.","I'd like to think I'd never do a gratuitous fart joke.","I'm not a believer in the pratfall. I don't think it's funny just to have someone fall down.","I've been directing for 25 years almost, and I've only directed nine films in that time because I like to be careful.","It's like the old rule-if you introduce a gun into the first act of a play, it's going to be used in the third act. So if you do a movie about criminals, you have to accept there's going to be Some action.","Multiplicity was a movie that tested really well. People seeing the movie really liked it, but then the studio couldn't market it. We opened on a weekend with nine other films.","My first few films were institutional comedies, and you're on pretty safe ground when you're dealing with an institution that vast numbers of people have experienced: college, summer camp, the military, the country club.","That's one of the great things about DVD: In addition to reaching people who didn't catch the movie in theaters, you get to have this interaction of sorts.","The cutting room is where you discover the optimal length of the movie.","The first comedy screenplay that I wrote was Animal House and I always thought I could and should be a director but no one was about to give me that opportunity on Animal House.","There's a personal story of my own that I will write at some point, and it's a film that I will happily make. It could very well be the next thing I do, unless someone shows me something great.","We are all several different people. There are different aspects of our nature that are competing.","We were tremendously encouraged by the testing of Analyze That. Audiences loved it. They were telling us that they liked it as much as the original. We recorded the laughs in the theater.","With both Caddyshack and Vacation, it's not like the subjects were serious enough that they engaged my interest for another round. I love the characters, and the actors were great, but I didn't see the need to make another Vacation movie.","You can't not have feelings about country clubs, whichever side you're on.","You just make sure you don't screw it up. It's going to work as long as you don't mess it up. Hopefully you have plenty of those moments in a big comedy.","I always point out to my Passover guests that the Hebrews were not living in isolation. They were at the crossroads of several great, elaborate cultures with their own mythology and religion and art and architecture and cultural belief. In fact, so many of the mythologies of the world describe the same events, just from different points of view.","If the only ideas you had were your own, you'd be very limited.","I was raised Jewish and fully embrace the core beliefs of Judaism - the ones that I identify as core beliefs, which are essentially freedom and justice. But the supernatural aspects of religion were never important to me.","You probably can't name more than a handful of comedies that would qualify for Best Picture. I can think of a lot of comedy screenplays; Woody Allen has had numerous nominations for his screenplays. But most comedies are calculated. They tend to pander. They're not about anything important.","There's a critic that I love, Manohla Dargis of the 'L.A. Weekly.' I like the underground point of view; it's my old radical sympathies. Maybe I like her because she likes my movies.","I can't imagine a successful comedy movie without a successful comedy performance at the heart of it.","'Analyze This' is a good movie because Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal are really good. But without the material to put on the play, of course, they couldn't be good. For me, it starts with the writing. I always think that the writer is doing the vast majority of the director's work, in a sense.","Films are big hits when they touch a lot of people. Things are not funny in a vacuum, they're funny because we respond to some personal dislocation, some embarrassment, some humiliation, some pain we've suffered, or some desire we have.","The comic edge of 'Ghostbusters' will always be the same. It's still treating the supernatural with a totally mundane sensibility.","I really only worked for about a month on 'Meatballs.' What happened was that Ivan Reitman figured out that studios wanted to meet everybody involved with 'Animal House' except the producer. So he thought he'd better start directing.","Everybody has a Bill Murray story. He just punishes people for reasons they can't figure out.","I had this 'War and Peace' thing of wanting to experience war as a kind of incredible human enterprise. I even applied to Officer Candidate School. Then the practical side of me kicked in and I thought, 'I really don't want to get drafted.' So I went down to the physical and checked every psychological disorder and drug on the medical history form.","There was a moment when we were casting 'Groundhog Day' when Bill Murray was not at the top of my list. He'd been getting crankier and crankier. By the end of 'Ghostbusters II', he was pretty cranky. I thought, 'Do I want to put up with this for twelve weeks?'","The simple idiot's advice I give to screenwriters who say they want to sell a screenplay is, 'Write good.'","As a director on 'The Office,' there's a tremendous weight that comes with directing features. I was being asked to direct a show that had already won an Emmy for Best Comedy. Steve Carell and the cast had already won the Screen Actor's Guild Awards.","I would remake 'Club Paradise.' I thought the story was cool, the setting was great. Everything lined up, except I wrote it for Bill Murray and John Cleese.","Ernie Hudson was new to the comedy world, and being the fourth Ghostbuster, he would have ideas, and he would talk to Ivan Reitman, and Ivan would kind of put him off. I could see how disappointed he was.","Chicago still remains a Mecca of the Midwest - people from both coasts are kind of amazed how good life is in Chicago and what a good culture we've got. You can have a pretty wonderful artistic life and never leave Chicago.","I'm at my best when I'm working with really talented people, and I'm there to gently suggest or guide or inspire or contribute whatever I can to their effort.","Comedy and tragedy co-exist. You can't have one without the other. I'm of the school that anything can be funny if seen from a comedic point of view.","Life doesn't care about your vision. Stuff happens, and you've just got to deal with it. You roll with it; that's the beauty of it all.","I would happily have done any of the 'Bourne Identity' sequels. There are good sequels, but I'm not good at making them.","It seems that, culturally, young people function more in groups. They know each other through digital media. All the young comedy people who work in TV are really used to working at the table with lots of writers around. They're comfortable in the group; they don't assert their own egos over everyone else.","The movie 'Vacation' had a whole different ending. They never even got to the amusement park, Wallyworld, at the end of 'Vacation.' The last 20 minutes of the film was entirely different - and bombed so badly that the audience just stopped cold."],"Harold Robbins":["Hemingway was a jerk.","I won't leave any unfinished manuscripts."],"Harold Rosenberg":["The purpose of education is to keep a culture from being drowned in senseless repetitions, each of which claims to offer a new insight.","The story of Americans is the story of arrested metamorphoses. Those who achieve success come to a halt and accept themselves as they are. Those who fail become resigned and accept themselves as they are.","What better way to prove that you understand a subject than to make money out of it?","America is the civilization of people engaged in transforming themselves. In the past, the stars of the performance were the pioneer and the immigrant. Today, it is youth and the Black.","The values to which the conservative appeals are inevitably caricatured by the individuals designated to put them into practice.","The differences between revolution in art and revolution in politics are enormous. Revolution in art lies not in the will to destroy but in the revelation of what has already been destroyed. Art kills only the dead.","The aim of every authentic artist is not to conform to the history of art, but to release himself from it in order to replace it with his own history.","They had enough. They wanted to enjoy their life.","Whoever undertakes to create soon finds himself engaged in creating himself.","No degree of dullness can safeguard a work against the determination of critics to find it fascinating.","American time has stretched around the world. It has become the dominant tempo of modern history, especially of the history of Europe."],"Harold Ross":["Think as you work, for in the final analysis, your worth to your company comes not only in solving problems, but also in anticipating them.","I asked Ring Lardner the other day how he writes his short stories, and he said he wrote a few widely separated words or phrases on a piece of paper and then went back and filled in the spaces.","Editing is the same as quarrelling with writers - same thing exactly."],"Harold Russell":["I'm the last guy left. That's what happens when you live to 84.","My life is a series of things that just happen.","The hooks didn't roll out any more sevens than my hands did before them.","The issue is whether the ultimate civil authority of the United States can tolerate actions in contempt of constitutional lines of authority. Any lessening of civil power over military power must inevitably lead away from democracy."],"Harold S. Geneen":["Leadership is practiced not so much in words as in attitude and in actions.","The best way to inspire people to superior performance is to convince them by everything you do and by your everyday attitude that you are wholeheartedly supporting them.","Every company has two organizational structures: The formal one is written on the charts; the other is the everyday relationship of the men and women in the organization.","A true leader has to have a genuine open-door policy so that his people are not afraid to approach him for any reason.","If your desk isn't cluttered, you probably aren't doing your job.","Leadership cannot really be taught. It can only be learned.","The five essential entrepreneurial skills for success: Concentration, Discrimination, Organization, Innovation and Communication.","It is an immutable law in business that words are words, explanations are explanations, promises are promises-but only performance is reality.","It is much more difficult to measure nonperformance than performance.","Performance stands out like a ton of diamonds. Nonperformance can always be explained away.","You cannot run a business, or anything else, on a theory.","In the business world, everyone is paid in two coins: cash and experience. Take the experience first; the cash will come later.","Facts from paper are not the same as facts from people. The reliability of the people giving you the facts is as important as the facts themselves.","We must not be hampered by yesterday's myths in concentrating on today's needs.","Management manages by making decisions and by seeing that those decisions are implemented.","I don't believe in just ordering people to do things. You have to sort of grab an oar and row with them.","You can know a person by the kind of desk he keeps. If the president of a company has a clean desk then it must be the executive vice president who is doing all the work.","The worst disease which can afflict business executives in their work is not, as popularly supposed, alcoholism; it's egotism.","Management must manage!","Managers in all too many American companies do not achieve the desired results because nobody makes them do it.","He suffered from paralysis by analysis.","It's better to take over and build upon an existing business than to start a new one.","You can't run a business or anything else on a theory.","Uncertainty will always be part of the taking charge process."],"Harold Simmons":["Money brings a lot of responsibility as to what you're going to do with it, and I've given quite a bit of thought to that.","You never talk about what you want when giving money. I don't pay attention to what other people think... There shouldn't be restrictions of any kind on political contributions.","I'm not trying to change an image, I'm just trying to make sure that the facts match the image. The facts are basically that I'm a builder. I have not dissembled any company nor split up any companies, nor do I ever buy any companies with that intent.","I don't think I have a black-hat image.","I definitely have a shareholders' perspective. I'm not doing that altruistically. I'm doing that because it's in my own self interest to do it. I think that's good for my other shareholders because they go along with me: If I do well for myself, then they do well for themselves."],"Harold Stephen Black":["The answer scrawled on a blank page in a daily newspaper, was conceived whilst aboard a ferry.","Negative feedback effected amplifier performance significantly."],"Harold Taylor":["The roots of true achievement lie in the will to become the best that you can become.","Most of the most important experiences that truly educate cannot be arranged ahead of time with any precision.","We want to take care of our employees, because they take care of our family."],"Harold Urey":["Nature can always be more complicated than we imagine.","The space program is not only scientific in purpose but also is an expression of man's insistent determination to do the nearly impossible - to explore the unknown, even at great risk.","In general, exchange reactions for the lighter isotopes have equilibrium constants sufficiently different from unity, so that the ratios of concentrations of the isotopes in two compounds which are in equilibrium differ by a few per cents in nearly all cases.","The discovery of deuterium and the marked differences in the physical and chemical properties of hydrogen and deuterium, together with an efficient method for the separation of these isotopes, have opened an interesting field of research in several of the major branches of science."],"Harold W.

We shall work as one people for our common good and our common goals.","That fallacy flies in the face of studies that show, every day, in every way, things are getting a little worse for America's minorities relative to the progress made by those in the top percentiles of assets and income.","What is so remarkable about the success of affirmative action is that it has been accomplished despite the Justice Department and the policies of the federal government.","Let's not be overconfident, we still have to count the votes.","I want to be a mayor who helped, really helped.","The third fallacy is that affirmative action doesn't work.","Throughout American history many of our social gains and much of our progress toward democracy were made possible by the active intervention of the federal government.","Our concern is to heal.

No book in the world equals the Bible for that.","Real courage is when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what.","I think there's just one kind of folks. Folks.","I never expected any sort of success with 'Mockingbird'...

I don't exclude myself from that. It's about being smarter than a hacker. Not about being smart.","Taking time to do something slower than you normally would is a privilege that should not be ignored.","I would still describe myself as a hacker. I still remember feeling the magic, the sense of discovery, when I first connected to a bulletin board. It seemed like the world was somehow brighter, the greens were greener. Like I'd stepped through a portal to the other side. I knew back then that things would never be the same again for me.","I have to say that you don't really know stress until you know that the path of the free world is resting a little bit on your shoulders.","We are often celebrating technology and codes, but we don't really think about the creative side.","My biggest worry is that no one seems to notice that we are not going to stop the technical progress that is going to continue to displace people through automation.","My parents are very supportive: they helped redirect my technology attitude and my punkness into positive things.","The opportunity to step away from everything and take a break is something that shouldn't be squandered.","We see these wonderful apps that really have changed our world in many good ways such as Uber or Airbnb, but at the same time, they're drastically changing the workforce. And they're changing them so much that the industries themselves are not able to keep up.","'Data scientist,' as a profession, is largely a fad.","Before I was hired by Obama's team as the CTO for his 2012 re-election campaign, I had certainly never been involved with anything of that nature before. Yet, I somehow knew I could do the job. I attribute that confidence to my experience as a hacker and the subsequent willingness to take risks.","I think there are a lot of hurdles between a normal consumer brand figuring out their mobile strategy - let alone their chat app strategy - and programming a Facebook Messenger chatbot.","There are a lot of people who are unable to take a break to clear their minds. I imagine they are the ones who need it the most.","You can tell charlatans when they say 'big' in front of everything.","In the U.S., it's all about turnout, which means you have to appeal to every single Democrat to get them to vote.","I can only speak to the Democrat side, but for the Democrats, everything is aggressively measured, and what that means is if you're going to use Snapchat, you're going to use it for a reason, not just for fun.","The digital team who were running Twitter, they weren't just going to put out a tweet for fun. They're going to try and figure out how do we measure the impact. Then they'd tweet it, and if it worked, great.","I am patiently waiting for the singularity.","In technology startups, there's a lot of winging it.","The team that I had built was all white dudes with the same perspective on things that was at times comfortable and easy, but we weren't as innovative as our competitors.","Not every time you open Messenger do you want an Uber, but when you do want an Uber, it appears. That is the goal.","We were orbiting around the idea of intent and context. We would take the bus into work, and if you said, 'Here's a shirt you might like,' and I open it on my mobile phone, I'm not going to pull out my credit card and wallet. We thought, 'How does someone do this? An e-mail to yourself, or you try to remember?'","I spent a lot of time hacking, doing all this stuff, building websites, building communities, working all the time, and then a lot of time drinking, partying, and hanging out. And I had to choose when to do which.","There is the egoism of technologists. We do it because we can create. I can handle all of the parameters going into the machine, and I know what is going to come out of it.","I'm not a very patient person in general.","If there's a wall, we break it down and go through it.","I usually hire people who have very exemplary work experience. Where they went to school, or what degree they have, really has no play into the hiring decision.","Myself, I have a philosophy degree and a fake computer-science degree. I say fake because I really didn't learn anything.","This idea of, there's a locked door; how do you open it? You don't necessarily care what's behind it; you're just more excited about opening the lock... It's not about finding the treasure; it's more about defeating the puzzle.","I wonder which is ultimately more creepy: shopping at Amazon or using Facebook?","PayPal's been around forever. How do we use that platform to solve the future of commerce?","What I do think is important is this idea of a 'privacy native' where you grow up in a world where the values of privacy are very different. So it's not that I'm against privacy but that the values around privacy are very different for me and for people who are younger than my parent's generation, for whom it's weird to live in a glass house.","We developed our product called Dashboard, which was a software tool that was designed to be a virtual campaign office to help volunteers communicate and collaborate through emails and interacting online. It was our attempt to take an offline field office and merge it online.","The first thing is - and this is very important - I support the unmonitored use of the Internet for everyone. It doesn't matter what country you're in or what you do for a living - everyone should have the right to an unmonitored Internet.","People are building apps that are doing super-crazy things, and there's a lot of talk about modeling and microtargeting. Facebook can predict when people are going to break up, and Target is able to predict if a woman is pregnant before she knows just based on the type of lotion she bought.","Our goal is to solve a problem for the retailer, not to solve a problem for my ego - which is big.","Mobile usage is going up; mobile conversion is not.","It was on a bulletin board that I first learned about hacker culture, the 'Let's just break through this wall and see what's on the other side' mentality.","I grew up in Greeley, Colorado, in a house without a television set. I was a very nerdy kid: I used to play 'astronaut' and eat bouillon as astronaut food. We also had tons of books.","I find that I often forget that people come from all over. In interfaces, products, experiences, and building for people, we always forget that people are not us.","When I give talks, I often quote from a button I received at a Google event: Always Be Creative. I use it to illustrate how important creativity is in technology and business.","I want to involve creativity more in technology and business. It is obvious that for us to be successful, a healthy relationship with creativity is needed.","Advice is always awesome because it never makes any sense when you compare it all together. It always contradicts other advice. I love advice.","Instagram is amazing, and I enjoy sharing photos there. However, I don't think it is where my photos will go to live.","Google Photos is great. I enjoy using it to curate my photo collection online. The integration on iOS to Apple Photos is a bit too much voodoo for me.","Photo management software is terrible. Mylio is pretty good - but disrupts the 'natural' flow of things: i.e. Apple Photos.","The thing about Snapchat is it is ephemeral, so you don't - it's not like a video that you post to YouTube and then everyone can see it. It's this video that you get to share this kind of very intimate experience again, this very kind of genuine experience with another person in a more one-on-one sort of way. And I really appreciate that.","I programmed computers every day. And one of my favourite apps we built was this thing called Awesome Updater, that all it did is send you a tweet randomly that was like, 'Yo, you're awesome.'","When I called people and said, 'Hey! Do you want to work for the president?' they usually said yes. I had 2 people say no. One person said no because they were a Republican; one person said no because they're a Libertarian.","When you have a good vision and a very large capability of impact, that's very powerful.","When you read Trump's tweets or see candidates interact online like Jeb did with Hillary, you're like, 'Yes, it's just like my friends.' That's the magic.","If you get a WhatsApp message, you're probably going to open it. That's the interesting thing.","Startupfest is a very positive conference. I think a lot of it has to do with how different culturally it is from other startup or tech conferences.","I never would wish technology failing on any sort of opponent or enemy.","TechStars offers a network, and being a part of that network is an awesome opportunity.","If there's one thing about Chicago, we take care of our own.","Chicago's a flyover city. I don't think we should try to change that. But it would be really cool if we had a little more opportunity for investors to come hang out.","My entire career has been based around commerce. The Obama campaign was famous for raising boatloads of money online. My question is how do you make conversions better through mobile and e-mail.","All of this conversation about chat and assistance lays the groundwork for what I would look at as the future of commerce.","I really think we have a future ahead of us where chat is obviously a big part of it, but I don't think the context of having that little assistant in your pocket is necessarily the only place where it will be.","Data is what powers all of us and our lives. It is ubiquitous among our now-connected lives. I love how it is now the oxygen of our Internet world.","If you want to go and build a company that exists in Silicon Valley, then you should go and do it there. But if you want to build a company that is Australian, that represents your culture and your being, then you should do it in Sydney.","I'm a white male in power. In many cases, I'm the enemy.","When you walk into a field office, you have many opportunities. We'll hand you a call sheet. You can make calls. You can knock on doors, and they'll have these stacks there for you. They'll say: 'Harper, you've knocked on 50 doors. That's great. Here's how you compare to the rest of them.' But it's all very offline.","Crowdsourcing is the future. However, if you don't trust your users to build/create/upload awesome work, they won't trust you with their crowd capital.","We didn't want to waste time by sending our volunteers to Republicans; we sent them to the undecided.","Presidential campaign and White House are two aggressively separate things. They still think I'm the weird kid in the corner, so I don't have much power. But I'll definitely do something to help.","Let's not project our fears onto others.","Ten Internets ago, when PayPal was started, it was all these tools that no one had built yet to bring commerce to the Internet. My first startup used PayPal.","The main ideas for us are scale, stability, and audience.","I read a lot of books. I read because it inspires me and shows me paths that I could never imagine. Sometimes those paths are horrible and sad, and sometimes they are hopeful and amazing. Not always are they paths to the future, and sometimes the paths are actually about the past but make sense when applied to the future. Books are amazing.","I love books that stand the test of time.","Books have literally powered most of my life. Whether as a stress relief when doing hard things or as vacation fodder, they are a constant and important part of my life.","When I look for new books, I often struggle to find things that challenge and entertain me. This has caused me to spend a number of cycles thinking about where I can get the serendipitous book discovery experience that we had in physical book stores.","When you go from building T-shirts to software for a presidential campaign used by a cast of millions, it's pretty easy to think, 'OK, we can build something pretty big.'","We make interesting companies and real businesses. It's not social networks for cats.","In New York City, they have their own way of doing things. Every city and every region should do its own thing.","The advice I used to give to engineers I hired was, 'Don't eat the pizza.' Sometimes when you walk into these high-pressure environments, it's, like, doughnuts everywhere and all these little cakes.","Don't eat the pizza; get lots of sleep - you have to take care of yourself. It's about being your tip top self at all times, and if you are unhealthy, or you're sick, or you don't feel good, even it's just because you're sluggish, you're not going to make it because you're not going to be able to react to things.","One of the things that I used to make sure I'd do was to always make sure I'd have dinner at home because I needed that disconnect from work. Even when it was crazy, I'd go home at, like, 10 o'clock and have dinner. That way, I had time where I could decompress a little bit and then go back in.","Oftentimes in tech, people think, 'I'm the only one that has this.' I call them the Atlas People. They're like, 'The weight of the world is on the shoulders. I'm the only person who can solve this problem.' But you can't do that.","Let's say we were a peacekeeping force in some small country that most people had never heard of. And we were there to host a peaceful election, and we then found out a bunch of stuff was hacked. We probably would push to have another election to make sure that would be fair.","Donald Trump won the election. I think that's true. I also think there was interference. If this was another country, I think we'd be demanding another election.","First of all, a giant corporation probably shouldn't be being hacked by teenagers. I put that on the corporation, not the teenagers. Teenagers are going to do what teenagers are going to do - rebelling. But if they're able to hack a big corporation, that seems like the corporation should be better at security.","Security is very difficult. You have to be very careful about security, and I think oftentimes people just forget; they don't invest in the right things.","One of my favourite books about hackers is 'Masters of Deception' about this hacking group in the 1990s. Many of them didn't come from wealthy families. These are kids that are very intelligent; they just happen to be misdirected.","The information diet of a senior campaign staffer is insane. We were all addicted to our chosen email delivery devices and were aggressively tethered to them. It made sense and wasn't an issue during the campaign because of the importance of the situation. However, once the campaign was over and we were successful, the information flow dried up.","I would say Silicon Valley and New York have inflated salaries.","A lot of people are buying things on the Internet - not just white men.","I try and wake up relatively early. I listen to some music and check Twitter. I also make sure I weigh myself and check how long I slept. I do that because knowing that data seems better than not knowing it.","I don't drink coffee; I drink a lot of green tea and water.","My career choice has largely been what I wanted to do. I always knew that technology would be one of the threads.","I've had a lot of bosses that I didn't agree with, but the worst boss was very much me myself. So, I can't let myself slack off, and if I do slacking off, I'm the one that's yelling at myself. I've worked with a lot of different employers, and none of them have been as aggressive as I have been.","Campaigns are crazy things. They're half startup, half enterprise."],"Harpo Marx":["In the house in Beverly Hills where our four children grew up, living conditions were a few thousand times improved over the old tenement on New York's East 93rd Street we Marx Brothers called home.","Harpo, she's a lovely person. She deserves a good husband. Marry her before she finds one.","I was the same kind of father as I was a harpist - I played by ear.","Susan, an only child who never had any roots, and I, a lone wolf who got married 20 years to late, were adopted by the kids as much as they were by us.","In the fall of 1943 we brought home our second son, whom we named Alexander.","In 1944 James Arthur and Minnie Susan were added to the Marx household."],"Harri Holkeri":["Peace enforcement is a much more difficult kind of operation than peacekeeping.","I do not want to speak about overpopulation or birth control, but I think education is the way to give new impetus to the poverty question.","The Baltic Sea is becoming more and more polluted. Not everybody living near the shore of the Baltic Sea is protecting it. It is the water of life for countries like Finland and Sweden.","Men and women have roles - their roles are different, but their rights are equal.","You cannot make easy decisions unless you first commit yourself to hard solutions.","If you come to a negotiation table saying you have the final truth, that you know nothing but the truth and that is final, you will get nothing.","In Finland, we learned quite a lot from our own civil war. The wounds were visible when I was a boy, but my generation went into the Second World War and it united the Finnish nation, so I do not see any more wounds.","I really do hope that the Millennium Summit gives new impetus to the work of the United Nations.","Finland had a civil war less than 100 years ago, just like in Ireland. If you look at the history of newly independent nations, civil war is almost every time present, even in the United States.","In Finland we have equal political rights for women and men. We do not regard ourselves according to sex.","If there is something I would like to do as President of the General Assembly, it is to place more emphasis on the issue of education, which enables a better life for women.","There are big issues, like the reform of the Security Council. These kinds of questions are something the President of the General Assembly must keep his eye on.","There are many challenges, there are many obstacles; let us try to change the obstacles to advantages.","We Finns represent a very transparent and open-minded way of reaching political decisions.","I think I can regard myself as a political decision-maker.","Discussion is just a tool. You have to aim; the final goal must be a decision.","In international or national crises, there are always questions of lack of confidence. You have to change the minds of the people in order to get results.","Without rebuilding the confidence between parties, you will never succeed.","We have the tools, but we have to learn how to use them. That is my political philosophy.","My opinion on who's wrong or who's right has nothing to do with the fact that we have to bring together people who are against each other, to transform antagonism into cooperation.","That is where consensus-building begins-with the idea that you have your own truth, but that the negotiator on the other side of the table has his own truth as well.","Without accepting the other person's thinking, you cannot further your own interest. You need the other's help to get results.","When the problems in Northern Ireland started, it was not a question of Protestantism or Catholicism, because the Catholic church was the only church at that time-it was a nationalist conflict.","In every European nation, there have been problems in history when the society was too divided.","If we go back in the history of different nations, violence and the use of force are part of their heritage. These are the traditions of mankind.","One of the biggest development issues in the world is the education of girls. In the United States and Europe, it has been accepted, but not in Africa and the developing countries.","I recently reread an article of mine written in 1964, and I think it is still valid. There is not much difference. Many of the items on the agenda 37 years ago are still there.","When my first child was born in 1962, I wrote a letter to my grandfather telling him how happy I was but how concerned; concerned because there were so many visions which were not very good.","I think we have grave problems. I am very much concerned about environmental questions, even though in Finnish society, we are not facing the most urgent problems.","What we can do as individuals may not be very much on the global scale, but we have to start the change by living as we are teaching."],"Harriet Ann Jacobs":["The beautiful spring came; and when Nature resumes her loveliness, the human soul is apt to revive also.","No pen can give an adequate description of the all-pervading corruption produced by slavery.","I would rather drudge out my life on a cotton plantation, till the grave opened to give me rest, than to live with an unprincipled master and a jealous mistress.","When my babe was born, they said it was premature. It weighed only four pounds; but God let it live.","Every where the years bring to all enough of sin and sorrow; but in slavery the very dawn of life is darkened by these shadows.","If you want to be fully convinced of the abominations of slavery, go on a southern plantation, and call yourself a negro trader. Then there will be no concealment; and you will see and hear things that will seem to you impossible among human beings with immortal souls.","Cruelty is contagious in uncivilized communities.","The slave girl is reared in an atmosphere of licentiousness and fear.","But to the slave mother New Year's day comes laden with peculiar sorrows. She sits on her cold cabin floor, watching the children who may all be torn from her the next morning; and often does she wish that she and they might die before the day dawns.","When they told me my new-born babe was a girl, my heart was heavier than it had ever been before. Slavery is terrible for men; but it is far more terrible for women.","For years, my master had done his utmost to pollute my mind with foul images, and to destroy the pure principles inculcated by my grandmother, and the good mistress of my childhood.","The secrets of slavery are concealed like those of the Inquisition.","Southern women often marry a man knowing that he is the father of many little slaves. They do not trouble themselves about it.","I WAS born a slave; but I never knew it till six years of happy childhood had passed away.","But I now entered on my fifteenth year - a sad epoch in the life of a slave girl. My master began to whisper foul words in my ear. Young as I was, I could not remain ignorant of their import.","There is something akin to freedom in having a lover who has no control over you, except that which he gains by kindness and attachment.","Always it gave me a pang that my children had no lawful claim to a name.","There is a great difference between Christianity and religion at the south. If a man goes to the communion table, and pays money into the treasury of the church, no matter if it be the price of blood, he is called religious.","When I was six years old, my mother died; and then, for the first time, I learned, by the talk around me, that I was a slave.","Death is better than slavery.","When I was nearly twelve years old, my kind mistress sickened and died.","If a slave is unwilling to go with his new master, he is whipped, or locked up in jail, until he consents to go, and promises not to run away during the year.","DURING the first years of my service in Dr. Flint's family, I was accustomed to share some indulgences with the children of my mistress.","Dr. Flint had sworn that he would make me suffer, to my last day, for this new crime against him, as he called it; and as long as he had me in his power he kept his word."],"Harriet Beecher Stowe":["Never give up, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn.","When you get into a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hang on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn.","The bitterest tears shed over graves are for words left unsaid and deeds left undone.","Friendships are discovered rather than made.","The past, the present and the future are really one: they are today.","In all ranks of life the human heart yearns for the beautiful; and the beautiful things that God makes are his gift to all alike.","Perhaps it is impossible for a person who does no good to do no harm.","To do common things perfectly is far better worth our endeavor than to do uncommon things respectably.","It's a matter of taking the side of the weak against the strong, something the best people have always done.","All places where women are excluded tend downward to barbarism; but the moment she is introduced, there come in with her courtesy, cleanliness, sobriety, and order.","To be really great in little things, to be truly noble and heroic in the insipid details of everyday life, is a virtue so rare as to be worthy of canonization.","I did not write it. God wrote it. I merely did his dictation.","Most mothers are instinctive philosophers.","Any mind that is capable of real sorrow is capable of good.","Everyone confesses that exertion which brings out all the powers of body and mind is the best thing for us; but most people do all they can to get rid of it, and as a general rule nobody does much more than circumstances drive them to do.","Whipping and abuse are like laudanum: you have to double the dose as the sensibilities decline.","One would like to be grand and heroic, if one could; but if not, why try at all? One wants to be very something, very great, very heroic; or if not that, then at least very stylish and very fashionable. It is this everlasting mediocrity that bores me.","No one is so thoroughly superstitious as the godless man.","So much has been said and sung of beautiful young girls, why doesn't somebody wake up to the beauty of old women.","A man builds a house in England with the expectation of living in it and leaving it to his children; we shed our houses in America as easily as a snail does his shell.","A woman's health is her capital.","I would not attack the faith of a heathen without being sure I had a better one to put in its place.","The obstinacy of cleverness and reason is nothing to the obstinacy of folly and inanity.","Where painting is weakest, namely, in the expression of the highest moral and spiritual ideas, there music is sublimely strong.","Human nature is above all things lazy."],"Harriet Harman":["Actually, I don't ever think there will be a men-only team of leadership in the Labour party again. People would look at it and say, 'What? Are there no women in the party to be part of the leadership? Do men want to do it all themselves?' It just won't happen again.","In a country where women regard themselves as equal, they are not prepared to see men running the show themselves.","I was aware that everybody said I was going to be a vast mega-flop, and that William Hague was just oh-so intelligent, and oh such a great parliamentarian, and therefore so different from me! So I thought, I must deprive them of the satisfaction of proving themselves right.","Is this the situation in the modern Conservative party? That women should be seen and not heard?","There are many women with children under five who want to work and who lack affordable, high-quality child care.","I don't agree with all-male leaderships. Men cannot be left to run things on their own. I think it's a thoroughly bad thing to have a men-only leadership.","I think a balanced team of men and women makes better decisions. That's one of the reasons why I was prepared to run for deputy leader.","Well, if you look at the programme that we're offering, I think that is a future which is fair for women as well as men. We're still heavily outnumbered - we're still four to one in parliament - but we are pioneers! We are forging a new path.","Well, I feel that everybody in the country knows me. I think people know who I am, and that I'm deputy leader of the Labour party, and that I'm out there talking about their big choice for the future.","I know we will look back on this and think how odd it was we were championing the rights of lone mothers to bring up their children on benefit.","It's hard to bring up your children on benefit. It's easier if you can do part- time work, or even full-time work, and actually have a better standard of living, and that's the direction in which we are going."],"Harriet Martineau":["A soul preoccupied with great ideas best performs small duties.","We do not believe in immortality because we can prove it, but we try to prove it because we cannot help believing it.","Laws and customs may be creative of vice; and should be therefore perpetually under process of observation and correction: but laws and customs cannot be creative of virtue: they may encourage and help to preserve it; but they cannot originate it.","If a test of civilization be sought, none can be so sure as the condition of that half of society over which the other half has power.","If there is any country on earth where the course of true love may be expected to run smooth, it is America.","The sum and substance of female education in America, as in England, is training women to consider marriage as the sole object in life, and to pretend that they do not think so.","Any one must see at a glance that if men and women marry those whom they do not love, they must love those whom they do not marry.","Fidelity to conscience is inconsistent with retiring modesty. If it be so, let the modesty succumb. It can be only a false modesty which can be thus endangered.","There have been few things in my life which have had a more genial effect on my mind than the possession of a piece of land.","It is my deliberate opinion that the one essential requisite of human welfare in all ways is scientific knowledge of human nature.","You had better live your best and act your best and think your best today; for today is the sure preparation for tomorrow and all the other tomorrows that follow.","But is it not the fact that religion emanates from the nature, from the moral state of the individual? Is it not therefore true that unless the nature be completely exercised, the moral state harmonized, the religion cannot be healthy?","Religion is a temper, not a pursuit.","For my own part, I had rather suffer any inconvenience from having to work occasionally in chambers and kitchen... than witness the subservience in which the menial class is held in Europe.","What office is there which involves more responsibility, which requires more qualifications, and which ought, therefore, to be more honorable, than that of teaching?","A soul occupied with great ideas performs small duties.","I am sure that no traveler seeing things through author spectacles can see them as they are.","Men who pass most comfortably through this world are those who possess good digestions and hard hearts.","The progression of emancipation of any class usually, if not always, takes place through the efforts of individuals of that class."],"Harriet Tubman":["Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.","Now I've been free, I know what a dreadful condition slavery is. I have seen hundreds of escaped slaves, but I never saw one who was willing to go back and be a slave.","I was the conductor of the Underground Railroad for eight years, and I can say what most conductors can't say; I never ran my train off the track and I never lost a passenger.","I had crossed the line. I was free; but there was no one to welcome me to the land of freedom. I was a stranger in a strange land.","I think slavery is the next thing to hell. If a person would send another into bondage, he would, it appears to me, be bad enough to send him into hell if he could.","I would fight for my liberty so long as my strength lasted, and if the time came for me to go, the Lord would let them take me.","I had reasoned this out in my mind, there was one of two things I had a right to, liberty or death; if I could not have one, I would have the other.","Never wound a snake; kill it.","I looked at my hands to see if I was the same person. There was such a glory over everything. The sun came up like gold through the trees, and I felt like I was in heaven.","In my dreams and visions, I seemed to see a line, and on the other side of that line were green fields, and lovely flowers, and beautiful white ladies, who stretched out their arms to me over the line, but I couldn't reach them no-how. I always fell before I got to the line.","I grew up like a neglected weed - ignorant of liberty, having no experience of it.","You'll be free or die!","I never had anything good, no sweet, no sugar; and that sugar, right by me, did look so nice, and my mistress's back was turned to me while she was fighting with her husband, so I just put my fingers in the sugar bowl to take one lump, and maybe she heard me, for she turned and saw me. The next minute, she had the rawhide down.","Most of those coming from the mainland are very destitute, almost naked. I am trying to find places for those able to work, and provide for them as best I can, so as to lighten the burden on the Government as much as possible, while at the same time they learn to respect themselves by earning their own living.","Lord, I'm going to hold steady on to You and You've got to see me through.","I said to de Lord, 'I'm goin' to hold steady on to you, an' I know you'll see me through.'","'Pears like my heart go flutter, flutter, and then they may say, 'Peace, Peace,' as much as they likes - I know it's goin' to be war!","I've heard 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' read, and I tell you Mrs. Stowe's pen hasn't begun to paint what slavery is as I have seen it at the far South. I've seen de real thing, and I don't want to see it on no stage or in no theater.","I think there's many a slaveholder'll get to Heaven. They don't know better. They acts up to the light they have.","Read my letter to the old folks, and give my love to them, and tell my brothers to be always watching unto prayer, and when the good old ship of Zion comes along, to be ready to step aboard.","Twasn't me, 'twas the Lord! I always told Him, 'I trust to you. I don't know where to go or what to do, but I expect You to lead me,' an' He always did.","Quakers almost as good as colored.

'Oh, Lord, convert ole master;' 'Oh, dear Lord, change dat man's heart, and make him a Christian.'","Why, der language down dar in de far South is jus' as different from ours in Maryland, as you can think. Dey laughed when dey heard me talk, an' I could not understand 'dem, no how."],"Harriet Van Horne":["Cooking is like love. It should be entered into with abandon or not at all.","There are days when any electrical appliance in the house, including the vacuum cleaner, seems to offer more entertainment possibilities than the television set.","One who roams the channels after dark, searching for buried treasure.","Rarely in broadcasting history has so much been riding on the whimsical flick of a few thousand wrists."],"Harriet Walter":["I'm childish and silly. Most people tease me because I'm a bit daft.","My centre of who I thought I was was never very consciously about being beautiful or attractive - I think I'm one of those people who's actually grown into their looks.","I read, I gossip, I do crosswords. I think chatting with friends is relaxing. I've picked them up all through my life - if you live long enough, you end up with quite a large circle.","I do think that there are certain parts, if you are lucky enough to play them, that are bigger than you, and they stretch you. I don't think you become a bigger person, but you develop certain muscles you didn't have before.","I came up almost completely through the subsidised theatre. I have never been absolutely at the market interface, where I've got to sell my wares or die - I've always been protected from that.","I just like watching people who really are not self-conscious, who aren't aware, because I fear that one could become too self-conscious, too artful, as an actor. Sometimes if you look at somebody, you can extrapolate from their exterior what might be happening in their interior. I'm nosy.","I lived with my mother all my life until she died, and I don't really think I knew her, because I was always using her as my mother, if you know what I mean.","I was not emotionally mature enough to accept any kind of success when I was young. I needed to go that long route.","Some people are instantly brilliant. The Kenneth Branaghs of this world are ready-formed actors at 23 - he has used his success in lots of different ways - but there are people out there for whom acting is: 'Ooh, I can get on the telly and be famous.'","I've been blessed with pretty strong stamina and healthy genes, so I'd call myself sensible. I've had regular mammograms ever since I found a lump in my breast when I was 30. Thankfully, all was well.","I'm not very good at going to sleep, and that's probably my worst problem. I don't need much more than seven and a half hours, but I probably get six. I take all my problems to bed with me and fret. I can't switch off.","As long as I am still interested and curious, I enjoy getting up in the morning, but I can't say I have a happy smile on my face 24/7.","I'm very aware that after you've played Cleopatra, there's not a lot that can top that in this sphere, so it means that I want to almost change the sphere I work in rather completely because I will always be comparing it to Cleopatra.","As I have got older, I have become easier on myself. It's about realising things can't be perfect.","Work has been the central column for most of my life; it has always been my identity.","Luckily, each generation brings forth great writers, actors, directors, and designers.","I've witnessed the survival of the theatre several times when it was meant to be dying.","I vote, but I don't feel that I'm achieving much when I do.","Male playwrights, on the whole, are probably more interested in male characters. They need women characters to be the women in their lives or to be the domestic difficulty.","Where does an actress go after playing Cleopatra's magnificent death? Why didn't Shakespeare write more - and more powerful - roles for mature women?","I've been taking lessons in Damehood from Judi Dench. Being a Dame is useful in restaurants, hotels, and restaurants, Judi says, but you have to get someone else to do the booking.","I yearn to make a really good, intelligent movie before I die: I don't completely rule out the possibility, but in Hollywood, I'm not bankable.","Romance is about investing in the future - with older people, there is less time for happy ever after.","I decided I was going to play Cleopatra as someone with a brain. She's kept Egypt, this tiny country, in a balance of power with the almighty Roman empire, and she's done it through force of personality.","The language is always powerful in Shakespeare, but with 'Antony and Cleopatra,' the speeches are so big and muscular and rich - exhausting to speak, actually.","Cleopatra was exhausting to play, but also completely exhilarating. She creates her own energy.","I've done a lot of Shakespeare over the years. You start to realise how the plays fit together; he's always using pieces from one and slotting them into others.","I'm no longer the young woman I was playing before, and I'm in a profession where that continuum that is me is irrelevant to most people - they're meeting me for the first time, seeing me for the first time, and they're seeing an old woman, so that's what I've got to start being.","Acting is what I do with who I am.","I think I have a deep-seated fear of being misunderstood. Or being misjudged.","I've found a much better love life in older age.","You need to distinguish between getting something off your chest that won't help anyone else or saying something because you know you will be hell to live with if you don't. Quite often, this will be beyond your control.","I'm an oversharer but selective about who I share with.","Caring less about what people think is a big thing for me.","Love is different at different stages of your life.","When I was really young, I wanted to be a fishmonger's wife.","I've one of those brains that doesn't quieten down.","My strangest experience was my six words in 'Star Wars.' I've had more fanmail from that than anything I've ever done."],"Harrison Birtwistle":["When I dealt with set theory, I could never make it be the music that I wanted.","It's the irrational things that interest me.","You either are or you're not.","When I was confronted with official tuition, the academic thing, I could see no relationship whatever between that and the music I'd been writing since I was 11.","When I was a kid, I wrote music - from the age of 11 until the age of 18.","This sounds horribly pretentious, but I like to think that if music hadn't existed, I could have invented it.","There are rhythmic ideas which sometimes only work up to a point. In writing there are moments when it just comes off the page, it's not just a collection of notes.","The thing about influence is that any composer worth anything will give you the same names.","The theatre only knows what it's doing next week, not like the opera, where they say: What are we going to do in five years' time? A completely different attitude.","The piece that had a large influence on me was Turangalila.","The opera tells the story with all the built-in contradictions and from many different angles.","People say my music is English. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's not me writing English music, but that English music is becoming more like me.","One thing I've tried to do in writing music is take on very basic things, very archetypal things.","My operas usually come from musical ideas rather than ideas about subject matter.","My operas and my theatre works are very formal pieces.","My attitude to writing is like when you do wallpapering, you remember where all the little bits are that don't meet. And then your friends say: It's terrific!","Music is such a problem in the time it takes.","Minimalism now is a reaction to what came before. It's absolutely of its time. Music moved into the set theory thing, and moved out of it.","In the end it doesn't matter what you do.","I'm not an architectural composer.","I'm not a music lover in the sense that I look for something to have on. I've never had that attitude to music.","I wrote music as soon as I knew notation.","I think there are influences that you open the door to, and influences that come under the door.","I think music has gone through a period of something very severe, rather radical, rather the way painting did with cubism.","I don't think there is much American music.","I don't have ideas so much as there are things which constantly evolve... there are various threads or layers, if you like, which change.","I didn't have a record player.","I always write the pieces I want to write."],"Harrison Ford":["We all have big changes in our lives that are more or less a second chance.","Nature doesn't need people - people need nature; nature would survive the extinction of the human being and go on just fine, but human culture, human beings, cannot survive without nature.","Bikes and planes aren't about going fast or having fun; they're toys, but serious ones.","To me, success is choice and opportunity.","I had a very strong feeling about the Vietnam War, and I had a strong feeling about participating in it. The military draft was in place, I was summoned for a physical exam, and I was either going to be classified as fit for military service or make my objection to it. So I made my objection to it.","Am I grumpy? I might be. But I think maybe sometimes it's misinterpreted.","On the first 'Indiana Jones' movie, I tore an ACL in one of my knees - can't remember which knee. The scene in which I was fighting the big German mechanic on an airplane called a flying wing, I was run over by the landing gear and injured my knee, but I can't remember which one it was. Lots of bumps and injuries along the way.","I don't mind doing interviews. I don't mind answering thoughtful questions. But I'm not thrilled about answering questions like, 'If you were being mugged, and you had a lightsaber in one pocket and a whip in the other, which would you use?'","We have to understand in value what the services of nature are so that we can understand that degrading them is an irreplaceable resource that no amount of money or human ingenuity can replace.","Really, what are the options? Levi's or Wranglers. And you just pick one. It's one of those life choices.","I get mad when people call me an action movie star. Indiana Jones is an adventure film, a comic book, a fantasy.","I love the comic opportunities that come up in the context of a father-son relationship.","I don't do celebrity endorsements. My work with Conservation International is a good use of whatever celebrity I might have to draw attention to important problems. I have the same responsibility as everyone to reduce consumption and to teach children to respect the environment.","I rarely play a real person, because I don't think I'm a good imitator.","You may get real tired watching me, but I'm not going to quit.","The kindest word to describe my performance in school was Sloth.","You know you're getting old when all the names in your black book have M. D. after them.","If I were a serious person, I'd probably have a real job.","Some actors couldn't figure out how to withstand the constant rejection. They couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel.","Everything I do, I'm sort of half in, half out.","I wanted to live the life, a different life. I didn't want to go to the same place every day and see the same people and do the same job. I wanted interesting challenges.","I'm like old shoes. I've never been hip. I think the reason I'm still here is that I was never enough in fashion that I had to be replaced by something new.","It doesn't interest me to be Harrison Ford. It interests me to be Mike Pomeroy and Indiana Jones and Jack Ryan. I don't want to be in the Harrison Ford business. I take what I do seriously, but I don't take myself seriously.","I'm quite curious and excited about seeing a new script for 'Blade Runner.' If, in fact, the opportunity would exist to do another, if it's a good script, I would be very anxious to work with Ridley Scott again; he's a very talented and passionate filmmaker. And I think it would be very interesting to revisit the character.","I enjoyed carpentry, and it was very good to me for 12 years.","I went down to Venezuela and ended up renting a helicopter and flew with my sons to the tops of the tepuis, these freestanding jungle mesas, 'lost worlds' as it were. In fact, it's almost impossible to access them without one. So we were able to land and spend some time there. We were trapped for about six hours by clouds that came in.","I actually like snakes! When I was young, I was a boy scout nature camp counselor, and one of our projects was collecting snakes and creating an environment for them, so I'm quite familiar with snakes and think they're fantastic creatures.","There is no child left within me, none whatsoever.","I wanted to be a forest ranger or a coal man. At a very early age, I knew I didn't want to do what my dad did, which was work in an office.","My character is meant to know nothing about rap, and not to like it very much, but I know about it, because my kids make me listen to it. There's some rap I do like very much. I like Eminem, Blackalicious.","My goal was just to work regularly. I didn't ever expect to be rich or famous. I wanted to be a working character actor.","I'm addicted to Altoids. I call them 'acting pills.'","If you're asking me to acknowledge that I've gotten older, I can do that.","Parenting is an impossible job at any age.","I could take Sean Connery in a fight... I could definitely take him.","The actor's popularity is evanescent; applauded today, forgotten tomorrow.","I think retirement's for old people. I'm still in the business, thank you. I have a young child of nine years old, and I want to live as long as I can to see him grow up. I'm enjoying my life and I want to stick around for as long as I can.","I retire every time I'm done with a movie. Then I go back. You know, I enjoy sleep. But I love to work; it's fun for me. As long as it continues to be fun, and I'm tolerated by the people around me, I will do it.","I fly myself everywhere. I like all kinds of flying, including practical flying for search and rescue. And I also like to fly into the backcountry, usually the Frank Church Wilderness in Idaho. I go with a group of friends, and we set up camp for about five days and explore little dirt strips and canyons.","We're all interconnected. For example, a simple lack of fresh water can lead to population dislocation, which can lead to political radicalization, which can lead to great pressure on the states that receive refugees because of a migrating population.","I'm not a poster boy for Conservation International. I'm a working member of the board.","The original 'Star Wars' that I was a part of really was the beginning of my working life.","It's very little trouble for me to accommodate my fans, unless I'm actually taking a pee at the time.","All my friends were going off to be professionals, and I said I wanted to be an actor.","Directing is too hard, it takes too much time, and it doesn't pay very well.","Hollywood's got its own particular environment.","I accrued anger from people's low opinion of me and my work, and for the work I might be capable of.","I have relationships with people I'm working with, based on our combined interest. It doesn't make the relationship any less sincere, but it does give it a focus that may not last beyond the experience.","I was always very grateful I was never hot. In the entire length of my career, I haven't been the most adored.","I was completely unprepared for the public spectacle my private life became, and didn't like it a bit.","I was never that much a focus of interest in my career. I'm aware of that now, which doesn't give me a lot of pleasure.","I've always been somewhere down from the top, so I've never had to suffer being knocked off the top.","I've never wanted to be the boss.","It took me a long time to figure out how to act, and how to conduct myself in the business so I could get what I felt I needed to support my potential and give them what they wanted.","My older kids are fantastic people. It can't be the result of my influence on them.","Sometimes I try to improve the language, the lines, or the delivery, but I don't ad-lib because I think that makes it really hard for everybody else involved.","The focus and the concentration and the attention to detail that flying takes is a kind of meditation. I find it restful and engaging, and other things slip away.","What I observed about my fellow actors was that most gave up very easily.","When I first started out, I was a bad actor.","The third time you say a thing it sounds like a lie.","I am not the first man who wanted to make changes in his life at 60 and I won't be the last. It is just that others can do it with anonymity.","What is news? It's hard to quantify. Certainly news has changed completely, and the morning shows are not really designed to bring you the news, except to tell you what happened overnight, and the rest of it is a kind of magazine mentality - a little bit of this, a little bit of that. It's harder to be an educated and informed citizen.","I don't do a huge amount of physical activity. I play tennis, I work out sporadically, and I eat well and take care of myself.","I have the ordinary experience of being anonymous when I'm in an airplane talking to air-traffic control, and they don't know who they're talking to. I have a lot of common experiences.","What's important is to be able to see yourself, I think, as having commonality with other people and not determine, because of your good luck, that everybody is less significant, less interesting, less important than you are.","The trick of this thing and the beauty of this thing is that it's a cowboy movie first and then stuff happens. Even after stuff happens it doesn't change - it hasn't suddenly changed into another kind of movie. It's still a cowboy movie. And that's what's incredible about it because nobody has done that before, that's new territory.","I think what a lot of action movies lose these days, especially the ones that deal with fantasy, is you stop caring at some point because you've lost human scale.","Starring in a science-fiction film doesn't mean you have to act science fiction.","My approach to acting is the 'let's pretend' school of acting.","I am Irish as a person, but I feel Jewish as an actor.","I think of myself as an assistant storyteller.","J. J. Abrams is a director that I've admired for a long time, from the very first scripts he wrote - including 'Regarding Henry,' which I was in.","I don't do nostalgia. It just doesn't occur to me. I'm living in the moment, and I don't have that gene.","I think 'Indiana Jones' was a lot of fun to do because of the places we went to and the adventures and the action. But Han Solo was also a huge part of my life.","The set for 'Blade Runner' was maybe the hardest set I've ever worked on because I think we worked 50 nights in a row, and it was always raining.","I want to go back to the Pantanal in Brazil. I've never been to sub-Saharan Africa. I'd like to take my Caravan over there and do a flying safari. I've never flown to Alaska.","I'd love to do another 'Indiana Jones.' A character that has a history and a potential, kind of a rollicking good movie ride for the audience, Steven Spielberg as a director - what's not to like?","I don't like baseball movies. I like movies about moral courage and people who are indomitable and courageous and right.","'Years of Living Dangerously' is a wonderful opportunity to reach a lot of people with the story and importance of climate change in our lives; in recent history, there's no bigger threat to the quality of human life than what is taking place right now in respect of climate change.","It's a privilege to be able to be involved with people as talented as the people I've had the luck to work with, and it's just been a great experience for me, and I'm glad that so many of the films I've had the luck to do were films that could be enjoyed by families together.","It's part of the job of the actor to torture the director."],"Harrison Salisbury":["Here, class attendance is expected and students are required to take notes, which they are tested on. What is missing, it seems to me, is the use of knowledge, the practical training.","By the way, I understand that now you can have the Times delivered to your door here in the Twin Cities.","I got a cable from New York saying that what I'd written about the growth of Soviet agricultural production didn't make sense because the same levels were reached under the czars. I wanted to confirm it, but by then the censors were on to me.","I think it's important to travel around in order to get a notion of what's going on, to find out what people are think about. I enjoy talking on campuses most because people are more informed and discussion is generally livelier.","I visited the Chinese side last year. The Chinese are in a constant state of military readiness. They have all their nuclear weapons in the area, presumably trained on targets across the border.","Journalism students need to understand it and need a solid background in the liberal arts, in sociology, economics, literature and language, because they won't get it later on.","Life within the Kremlin was shrouded in impenetrable secrecy.","The newspaper is a marvelous medium. It is extraordinarily convenient and cheap. Let's see. This one cost 75 cents. Now that's a little high. I bought it when I was downtown this morning."],"Harry A. Blackmun":["Disapproval of homosexuality cannot justify invading the houses, hearts and minds of citizens who choose to live their lives differently.","The states are not free, under the guise of protecting maternal health or potential life, to intimidate women into continuing pregnancies.","The right of an individual to conduct intimate relationships in the intimacy of his or her own home seems to me to be the heart of the Constitution's protection of privacy.","In order to get beyond racism, we must first take account of race. There is no other way. And in order to treat some persons equally, we must treat them differently.","By placing discretion in the hands of an official to grant or deny a license, such a statute creates a threat of censorship that by its very existence chills free speech.","It is precisely because the issue raised by this case touches the heart of what makes individuals what they are that we should be especially sensitive to the rights of those whose choices upset the majority.","I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death.","Who is to say that 5 men 10 years ago were right whereas 5 men looking the other direction today are wrong.","The flaw in the statute is that in all its applications, it operates on a fundamentally mistaken premise that high solicitation costs are an accurate measure of fraud.","What the Court really has refused to recognize is the fundamental interest all individuals have in controlling the nature of their intimate associations."],"Harry Anderson":["I am richer than Davy Crockett. I can settle back and do what I want to do. And what I want to do is card tricks and magic.","Even a fool knows you can't touch the stars, but it won't keep the wise from trying.","I'll give it a shot. But I don't know that a year from now I'm going to be here. Nobody does.","But I'm very thankful that no one is slamming my head against the wall anymore.","The biggest challenge in New Orleans has been to find workers who can climb a ladder after lunch.","We treated all of the dead with dignity.","There's this perception sometimes around here that I'm this Hollywood guy.","I'm not Hollywood. I'm a Quarter Rat. I belong here.","Is now the time to legalize prostitution?"],"Harry Belafonte":["Although slavery may have been abolished, the crippling poison of racism still persists, and the struggle still continues.","You can cage the singer but not the song.","My activism always existed. My art gave me the platform to do something about the activism.","Fascism is fascism. Terrorism is terrorism. Oppression is oppression.","The Ku Klux Klan, for some of us, is a constant - has a constant existence. It isn't until it touches certain aspects of white America that white America all of the sudden wakes up to the fact that there is something called the Klan and that it does its mischief.","I think Bush has a very selfish, arrogant point of view. I think he is interested in power, I think he believes his truth is the only truth, and that he will do what he wants to do despite the people.","I don't think soldiers should be anywhere in the world. I mean, that is a moral and a basic philosophy. I think that the only way to end wars is to have no military and to find other ways in which - I think we should suspend all nuclear weapons.","Bring it on. Dissent is central to any democracy.","This generosity that has been offered to the United States says very much about the Venezuelan spirit.","Our foreign policy has made a wreck of this planet. I'm always in Africa... And when I go to these places I see American policy written on the walls of oppression everywhere.","You can be arrested and not charged. You can be arrested and have no right to counsel.","I've always been supportive of the right of Israel as a state, and I've always fought against anti-Semitism, even in my own community.","If you believe in justice, if you believe in democracy, if you believe in people's rights, if you believe in the harmony of all humankind - then you have no choice but to back Fidel Castro as long as it takes!","Without the rebellious heart, without people who understand that there's no sacrifice we can make that is too great to retrieve that which we've lost, we will forever be distracted with possessions and trinkets and title.","America has never been moved to perfect our desire for greater democracy without radical thinking and radical voices being at the helm of any such quest.","The pursuit of justice is all I have ever known.","I'm not quite sure precisely when social and political activism became a visible brand of my DNA, but it seems to me that I was born into it. It is hard to be born into the experience in the world of poverty and not develop some instinct for survival and resistance to those things that oppress you.","If you want to look at the Monroe Doctrine and what happened when we wrote that, we stated what the business would be for America's power, especially in this hemisphere. We have always been the colonizer of this hemisphere, wherever we've been.","Peace is necessary. For justice, it is necessary. For hope, it is necessary, for our future.","I call President Bush a terrorist. I call those around him terrorists as well: Condoleezza Rice, Rumsfeld, Gonzales in the Justice Department, and certainly Cheney.","Poverty is terror. Having your Social Security threatened is terror. Having your livelihood as an elderly person slowly disappearing with no replenishment is terror.","I don't think that we are a species or a people that can exist without making mistakes somewhere along the line.","Poverty was my mother's midwife. She had her children in poverty. But she also found a road to bring us a sense of purpose, and she taught us how to be valiant in the face of oppression.","I think there's no city quite like New York, and I've seen most of the developed cities of the world. I admire this place, its energy. It's the repository of so much history and culture and diversity.","I think New York City most represents what it is that America in general aspires to. It's big; it's dense. I've known this city from all of its social arcs. The best that's in America is yet to come. The worst that's in America is yet to come.","When I was 20 and 30, my visions for what the world would be, all things were possible.","What makes a movement work are thousands of parts that come together and express itself in favor of a given destination or objective. You have to find men and women who are willing to play the role that each of these things demand.","Movements don't die, because struggle doesn't die.","I knew Charlie Parker, and he gave us such a gift with his music. He put so much into so little space, and it was tragic that he died so young.","I grew up in the Great Depression, and the jazz artists and Dixieland musicians were at the core of our communications and enjoyment. They were not passing fancies. They are something that is, and will be, listened to again and again. I have a space of reverence for some of those old jazz stars such as Sydney Bechet and Louis Armstrong.","John Steinbeck is one of the most under-discussed and under-written-about of all American writers. He is way up there and should stand on a par, or even above, Ernest Hemingway and William Faulkner.","One of the true pleasures of my life has been the work of John Steinbeck. He was one of the people who turned my life around. I had no direct relationship with him, unfortunately.","I'm always suspicious of celebrities that write about their lives.","All too often, I'm sorry to say, I relegated my family to the cracks and margins."],"Harry Bertoia":["The urge for good design is the same as the urge to go on living."],"Harry Bridges":["There will always be a place for us somewhere, somehow, as long as we see to it that working people fight for everything they have, everything they hope to get, for dignity, equality, democracy, to oppose war and to bring to the world a better life.","I'm a machine man, and I head a machine.","I'm a working stiff. I just happened to be around at the right time, and nobody else wanted the job.","There is a weapon we can fight with. That is the weapon of political action.","Neither, I must say with all due respect, is it the power of teachers and students. Basically the true and real power is with working people of all colors, of all beliefs, of all national origins.","Everything is produced by the workers, and the minute they try to get something by their unions they meet all the opposition that can be mustered by those who now get what they produce."],"Harry Browne":["Since no one but you can know what's best for you, government control can't make your life better.","A fair trial is one in which the rules of evidence are honored, the accused has competent counsel, and the judge enforces the proper courtroom procedures - a trial in which every assumption can be challenged.","Left-wing politicians take away your liberty in the name of children and of fighting poverty, while right-wing politicians do it in the name of family values and fighting drugs. Either way, government gets bigger and you become less free.","The Bill of Rights isn't some legalistic fine print. It was written to make our lives freer, more prosperous, and happier. By forsaking it, America has become no better than any other country in the world.","The important thing is to concentrate upon what you can do - by yourself, upon your own initiative.","A Libertarian society of unfettered individualism spreads its benefits to virtually everyone - not just those who have the resources to seize political power.","Forcing people to be generous isn't humanitarian, effective, compassionate or moral. Only acts that are truly voluntary for all concerned can be truly compassionate.","It is well known that in war, the first casualty is truth - that during any war truth is forsaken for propaganda.","Everything you want in life has a price connected to it. There's a price to pay if you want to make things better, a price to pay just for leaving things as they are, a price for everything.","A great burden was lifted from my shoulders the day I realized that no one owes me anything.","What we really need is compassion of the mind - compassion for others that is directed intelligently and produces truly compassionate results.","Freedom and responsibility aren't interconnected things. They are the same thing.","The government's War on Poverty has transformed poverty from a short-term misfortune into a career choice.","Contrary to all the blather we here about the unique goodness of the American people or our religious heritage or anything else, the one thing that set this country apart from all others was the Bill of Rights.","In the 1880s, people all over the world looked to America for inspiration. Its very existence was proof that it was possible to have a relatively free and peaceful country. No income tax, no foreign wars, no welfare state, no intrusions on civil liberties.","Libertarians know that a free country has nothing to fear from anyone coming in or going out - while a welfare state is scared to death of poor people coming in and rich people getting out.","Some people object to libertarian ideas because there are too many irresponsible people in the world - people who will cause trouble if the government doesn't restrain them.","You don't need an explanation for everything, Recognize that there are such things as miracles - events for which there are no ready explanations. Later knowledge may explain those events quite easily.","Security... it's simply the recognition that changes will take place and the knowledge that you're willing to deal with whatever happens.","You can't give the government the power to do good without also giving it the power to do bad - in fact, to do anything it wants.","Whatever the price, identify it now. What will you have to go through to get where you want to be? There is a price you can pay to be free of the situation once and for all. It may be a fantastic price or a tiny one - but there is a price.","Everyone will experience the consequences of his own acts. If his act are right, he'll get good consequences; if they're not, he'll suffer for it.","You don't have to buy from anyone. You don't have to work at any particular job. You don't have to participate in any given relationship. You can choose.","You are where you are today because you have chosen to be there.","Each person is living for himself; his own happiness is all he can ever personally feel.","When people do things for you, it's because they want to - because you, in some way, give them something meaningful that makes them want to please you, not because anyone owes you anything.","You owe it to yourself to be the best person possible. Because if you are, others will want to be with you, want to provide you with the things you want in exchange for what you're giving to them.","The Constitution isn't written in Chinese, Swahili or Sanskrit. It's in plain English.","Whenever I say that America has become an empire, someone is sure to say I'm being ridiculous.","America rules the world - by force.","But, actually, it is only Americans who say that our freedoms and prosperity are the reason foreigners hate us. If you ask the foreigners, they make it clear that it's America's bullying foreign policy they detest.","For most of our history, Americans enjoyed both liberty and security from foreign threats.","World War II has always been of great interest to me. I've known for decades that it was just one more war the politicians suckered us into.","There was no military reason to drop atomic bombs on Japan. They were used as terrorist weapons - killing innocent people to influence other people.","I'm old enough to remember the end of World War II. On Aug. 14, 1946, a year after the Japanese were defeated, most newspapers and magazines had single articles commemorating the end of the war.","I'm sorry that I can't snap my fingers and undo 50 years of bad American foreign policy.","Libertarians understand a very simple fact of life: Government doesn't work. It can't deliver the mail on time, it doesn't keep our cities safe, it doesn't educate our children properly.","Government is force, pure and simple. There's no way to sugar-coat that. And because government is force, it will attract the worst elements of society - people who want to use government to avoid having to earn their living and to avoid having to persuade others to accept their ideas voluntarily.","Like many people, most Libertarians feel empathy and sympathy for less fortunate people. But they know you can't have perfection in a world of limited resources.","Everything we know about human nature and about government tells us that individuals using their own money will achieve far more good for themselves and far more for others than politicians spending money they didn't have to work to earn.","Only free people have an incentive to be virtuous. Only people who bear the consequences of their own acts will care about those consequences and try to learn from their mistakes.","If younger people see older people who haven't planned ahead and have to rely on charity, the young will be more likely to provide for the future. Today when someone plans poorly, the only consequence people see is a demand for more government.","Voluntary association produces the free market - where each person can choose among a multitude of possibilities.","The American way was for commerce, personal relationships, and religion to be voluntary. No one was forced to participate in something he didn't want.","It has long been apparent that many people in the media don't believe you're competent to make your own decisions.","While most people in TV, radio, and the press have treated me wonderfully, some of the most important people want to pretend I don't exist.","I found that I was getting a warm reception for my message of freeing you from the income tax, releasing you from Social Security, ending the insane war on drugs, restoring gun rights, and reducing the federal government to just its constitutional functions.","Communities don't think, don't believe, don't want, don't have needs, don't have interests and don't make decisions. Only individuals have minds that generate desires and needs - and only individuals can make choices and decisions.","The communitarians may say you've been enjoying too much individual freedom, and that you must give up some of that for the benefit of the community. But they really mean that they want more power over your life - to force you to subsidize, obey and conform to their choices."],"Harry Callahan":["I wish more people felt that photography was an adventure the same as life itself and felt that their individual feelings were worth expressing. To me, that makes photography more exciting.","Experience is the best teacher of all. And for that, there are no guarantees that one will become an artist. Only the journey matters."],"Harry Caray":["Now, you tell me, if I have a day off during the baseball season, where do you think I'll spend it? The ballpark. I still love it. Always have, always will.","It might be, it could be... it is! A home run!","It's the fans that need spring training. You gotta get 'em interested. Wake 'em up and let 'em know that their season is coming, the good times are gonna roll.","Holy cow!","I'll tell you what's helped me my entire life. I look at baseball as a game. It's something where people can go out, enjoy and have fun. Nothing more.","I knew the profanity used up and down my street would not go over the air... So I trained myself to say 'Holy Cow' instead.","You know they're not going to lose 162 consecutive games.","I know it is the fans that are responsible for me being here. I've always tried in each and every broadcast to serve the fans to the best of my ability.","I've only been doing this fifty-four years. With a little experience, I might get better.","My whole philosophy is to broadcast the way a fan would broadcast.","When I die, I hope they don't cremate me 'cuz I'll burn forever."],"Harry Carey, Jr.":["You can always tell a novice rider; they aren't comfortable in the saddle and have to hang on.","My journey has been that of a character actor.","I've worked with the great and the not-so-great. But mostly I've worked with men and women who loved their profession, and who like me, had kids to raise and houses to pay for.","I was an expert horseman.","I loved Allan Dwan. He was a tough old guy."],"Harry Chapin":["When in doubt, do something.","But you can travel on for ten thousand miles, and still stay where you are.","Our lives are to be used and thus to be lived as fully as possible, and truly it seems that we are never so alive as when we concern ourselves with other people.","I've got nothing against selling out, but just let me do it for something that matters. Not so I can be Number One With a Bullet, as it were, but so I can leave this world feeling like I made a difference.","I am a greedy, selfish bastard. I want the fact that I existed to mean something.","Good dreams don't come cheap, you've got to pay for them and If you just dream when you're asleep this is no way for them to come alive... to survive.","When you're going nowhere, anywhere's a better place to be.","She knows more of love than the poets can say, and her eyes offer something that won't go away.","I want the fact that I existed to mean something.","The reason nobody else in my business has any impact is because they're all comatose."],"Harry Cohn":["I don't have ulcers; I give them.","If I wasn't the head of a studio, who would talk to me?","The word 'gratitude' is not part of the Hollywood dictionary.","I have never met a grateful performer in the movies."],"Harry Connick, Jr.":["I love my wife and I know she loves me. We're best friends. We're just lucky to have found each other. It takes a lot of work but I just feel very blessed that I found the right person. It's a very fortunate situation and not everyone has that.","I do the things I like to do. It's sort of a bigger version of having more than one hobby.","Marriage has made me a lot happier and I'm deeply in love with my wife, and I thank God for her every day.","My Dad is my hero.","I was raised in the environment where it really wasn't about sittin' around dreaming all the time, it was about practicing and workin' really hard and if a dream ever came to you, you'd be prepared for that opportunity.","Everything I do is part of my passion. I do the things I like to do. It's sort of a bigger version of having more than one hobby. I love to play piano, sing, and act. I love to do all those things.","I've been all over the world. I love New York, I love Paris, San Francisco, so many places. But there's no place like New Orleans. It's got the best food. It's got the best music. It's got the best people. It's got the most fun stuff to do.","There are more than 300,000 families in the Gulf region that lost their homes and are waiting for peace of mind. The hurricane exposed the sad reality of poverty in America. We saw, in all its horrific detail, the vulnerabilities of living in inadequate housing and the heartbreak of losing one's home.","The two are unrelated. I'm not into turtles or space stuff.","Live theater is just an incredibly powerful medium, and I think anyone who goes, whether they know about it or not, if they see something that sort of fits with them, it's kind of hard to deny that they had a good time.","I live in Connecticut, but eventually I'd like to move back to New Orleans. I grew up there; the pace is a bit slower. Plus, I love crawfish and po'boys.","I've spent hours playing video games.","It is really rare to find someone you really, really love and that you want to spend your life with and all that stuff that goes along with being married.","It is really rare to find someone you really, really love and that you want to spend your life with and all that stuff that goes along with being married. I am one of those lucky people. And I think she feels that way too. So the romantic stuff is easy because you want them to be happy.","There's an album by Antonio Carlos Jobim - the album with 'The Girl From Ipanema.' That's the most seductive music ever.","It is jazz music that called me to be a musician and I have always sang the songs that moved me the most. Singers, like Frank Sinatra and myself, we interpret the songs that we like. Not unlike a Shakespearean actor that goes back to the greatest words ever written, we go back to the greatest songs.","Everything I do is part of my passion.","I say sorry to my wife about five times a day for various reasons.","You can't have a perfect show every time.","I have those dreams that you can't put into words.","Safety's just danger, out of place.","Everything that I have professionally, and so much of what I have personally, is because of this great, fair city, and to see it being drowned like this is almost unbearable.","If your record doesn't sell that well, man, who cares? All the satisfaction I need... comes when I step out onstage and see the people. That's awesome. I love that.","I've learned that people latch onto labels and stereotypes. There was a period when I was asked in every single interview how I liked being the new Frank Sinatra... I think people will soon realize that I do a lot more than interpret old songs.","You have to read scripts and audition and develop relationships. It takes a long time to develop a body of work but over the last 25 years I guess I've done that many movies. In hindsight it may seem effortless, but there's a lot of work that goes into it.","We would like to get to a point in our society where people really are colorblind and this message would not have to be told anymore. Unfortunately, we're not there yet.","A lot of the music that you listen to now is because of the things that the Meters did, the Neville Brothers did, and they're there, the guys who invented those beats that the guys sample today. Such an enormous opportunity.","Sometimes you try a song and people don't respond, or you tell a story and you just hear crickets. But when you play thousands of shows, you start to refine stuff.","'The Christmas Song,' by Nat King Cole, is not only a masterful performance; to me it just sounds like the holidays. I've never sung it, because Nat's version is so perfect. I gotta leave it alone.","I like to jump some rope and swing kettle bells to get my blood pumping. It makes my voice sound better, and it clears my head.","You know what's funny? I don't ever feel the need to escape. I have a strong marriage. I like my life. You hear about these guys having midlife crises - I don't see that happening to me.","I don't really get shaken very much. People could heckle me, a spotlight could go out, I could forget a lyric... I'm not operating on somebody's brain, you know what I mean? So I just think it's all funny.","Before I had kids I'd go out on the road for months and months at a time, but now I don't think I'd want to do that anymore, because I'd miss too much time at home, so it's just a matter of monitoring how much work that I do and how much time I'm on the road.","We have been working with Habitat for Humanity and we have built eighty homes, 80% of which are being lived in by New Orleans' musicians. It is called the Musicians' Village and at the center is the Ellis Marsalis Center for Music.","My Dad is my hero. He's 85 now and he is in great health. He is handsome and strong. He has an incredible moral and ethical backbone. I couldn't have been luckier with my parents.","If you can say the lyrics almost like a poem and they stand up, that's a great thing. Some songs have great lyrics and I don't like the melodies, and vice versa.","I'm not trying to be romantic. I think you can tell when people are trying to be sexy onstage. When I was doing 'All the Way,' I was really thinking about my wife. People don't know my personal experience, but they can tell it's an honest interpretation.","You won't talk to anybody who breaks lyrics down more thoroughly. It's just a complete deconstruction, and when you start to rebuild, nobody has the capacity to do it like me. Which is not to say I'm better, it's just that there's a unique quality to everyone.","I'm a huge Freddie Mercury fan. I think he was the end-all. I love his lack of inhibition, his talent, the chances he took. He made mistakes on his records, and he didn't care.","You know, things kind of happen organically and, you know, Broadway sort of happened out of a career in performing and - which happened out of practicing piano when I was a kid.","My dad was the district attorney of New Orleans for about 30 years. And when he opened his campaign headquarters back in the early '70s, when I was 5 years old, my mother wanted me to play the national anthem. And they got an upright piano on the back of a flatbed truck and I played it.","My mom and I were super tight. I think she really wanted me to be an artist, you know? She used to like to tell people she wanted to be Beethoven's mother. That was her thing. She wanted to be the mother of this person.","When I did the album for 'When Harry Met Sally,' I found myself out there in front of this big band, which I had no idea how to do, and they wiped the floor with me. It's a very specific skill, and I didn't know how to do it.","I'm a natural piano player. So all the practicing I do at this point is in my head. If I don't play for a year, my chops aren't going to get any worse. I've spent my time playing scales, and I don't necessarily want to play any faster than I play. So everything I do at this point is more philosophical.","I always laugh at these rock n'rollers where you can't understand them. Mind you, it's not because they're inaudible or indistinguishable; it's because they're too obscure.","I used to go to Bourbon Street when I was a kid and there would be club after club after club of people who were around when the music started. I mean these are legendary, maybe not so well known, but legendary musicians.","I'm not a movie star. People know me, but they don't necessarily know what they know me for. I get recognised, but it's not like Justin Bieber. It's a nice thing, people are cool.","When I'm acting, I'm in a different place, singing is the last thing on my mind, and when I'm on stage, there's no acting at all involved, not even presentation, it's just who I am.","The whole 'American Idol' way of looking at things is the antithesis of what I grew up with. There are a whole lot of kids wanting to be famous now, whereas if I'd even mentioned that word to one of my teachers, I would have got into a whole load of trouble.","I have a big ego, and I'm a confident person, but when it comes down to being a jerk, that doesn't work for me, I tried it... for about ten years.","I have no doubt that the government of this great nation will work with its people to lead New Orleans and the Gulf Coast back to an enlightened, proud, safe part of the world.","I practice and work hard at my music, but I'm not saving lives here.","I'm having a lot of fun, enjoying my life and trying to raise my children.","I'm able to sometimes express things even more articulately on the piano than I am with singing.","I couldn't have been luckier with my parents.","Singers, like Frank Sinatra and myself, we interpret the songs that we like. Not unlike a Shakespearean actor that goes back to the greatest words ever written, we go back to the greatest songs and bring about my interpretation of them.","It is jazz music that called me to be a musician and I have always sang the songs that moved me the most.","My life is spontaneous and things just kind of happen.","My dad and mom believed that you do what you have to do in private and don't make a big deal out of it. Just try to help people as much as you can.","I think a dad has to make his daughter feel that he's genuinely interested in what she's going through.","I mean these people who work on Broadway, in my opinion, are the most gifted of everyone. I mean they really know how to dance. They really know how to act. They really know how to sing. They know how to perform.","I guess play piano, you know, because that's the thing I started doing when I was a little kid.","Well, my dad was the district attorney of New Orleans for about 30 years.","Well, my mother, I knew until I was 13. She died when I was 13.","There's some things I can't write about, just terrible personal tragedies.","I'm sure that there are reasonable people that had some reasonable projections about the future of New Orleans, but none of those could include not trying to rebuild the city and make it better than it was before.","Well, I'm an optimist.","I'd like to move back to New Orleans.","There are people who can't stand me, they say, 'God, he makes me sick', or, 'He's creepy', but it doesn't affect me too badly.","I'm really boring, man. Like, I'm really dull. And I think people may think that I have this glamorous, fun lifestyle, but it's pretty dull. But that's what I like.","You know, I feel as comfortable in an uncomfortable situation as I do when things are going smoothly.","I just liked the feeling of being on stage.","I had tons of friends, played ball with my friends on the street, and did the normal things.","Not everybody gets to record with an orchestra, and not everybody that gets to record with an orchestra gets to write all their own stuff.","I don't ever feel the need to escape.","You hear about these guys having midlife crises - I don't see that happening to me.","I like my life.","All the satisfaction I need... comes when I step out onstage and see the people. That's awesome. I love that.","I don't want to say the same lines every night.","I have worked with Habitat for Humanity for awhile.","I have done songs here and there. But I have never scored a film. That is something I would like to do at some point.","I'm not a big goal guy.","I only tour in short bursts, I'm only ever away from my family and three daughters for a month or two.","Golf is good, it means I get some fresh air and exercise, take my mind off work and see some of the landscape of the place I'm visiting.","I get terrible reviews everywhere I go.","I don't really find girls to be any more dramatic or delicate than boys; I've known plenty of little boys who've had miserable breakdowns over things... in fact, I was one of them!","I've raised my girls in a sort of genderless fashion. I mean, I'll take them to get their nails done - I actually love doing that - but I also play ball with them. As a result, my girls are tough and athletic and game for everything.","I never dated much."],"Harry Crews":["There is something beautiful about all scars of whatever nature. A scar means the hurt is over, the wound is closed and healed, done with.","Survival is triumph enough.","He did not know what love was. And he did not know what good it was. But he knew he carried it around with him, a scabrous spot of rot, of contagion, for which there was no cure.","What the artist owes the world is his work; not a model for living.","Teaching, real teaching, is - or ought to be - a messy business."],"Harry Crosby":["I have asked the village blacksmith to forge golden chains to tie our ankles together. I have gathered all the gay ribbons in the world to wind around and around and around and around and around and around again around our two waists.","I have invited our little seamstress to take her thread and needle and sew our two mouths together.","Though we hear various reports of his existence we can never find the young wizard who is able so they say to graft the soul of a girl to the soul of her lover so that not even the sharp scissors of the Fates can ever sever them apart."],"Harry Day":["Rules are for the obedience of fools and the guidance of wise men."],"Harry Dean Stanton":["I just want to say, good night, sweet prince, may flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.","'Pretty In Pink' was a huge hit for me.","There is no answer. That's what Buddhism says. The Void, oblivion, no answer. To be in that state is an enlightened state.","I am not into any religions. I have been mostly influenced by Eastern religions - Taoism, the essence of Hinduism and Buddhism. But my belief is not having any beliefs.","Everything changes every day.","I would've preferred to blossom earlier in life.","You want people to feel something when you tell a story, whether they feel happy or whether they feel sad.","My feeling or philosophy is closer to Taoism and Zen Buddhism, 'cause it's the most practical.","You get older. In the end, you end up accepting everything in your life - suffering, horror, love, loss, hate - all of it.","The void, the concept of nothingness, is terrifying to most people on the planet. And I get anxiety attacks myself. I know the fear of that void. You have to learn to die before you die. You give up, surrender to the void, to nothingness.","I was the classic killer. I always played an angry man. I think it was because I used to really be like that - I was hostile. And because I had a good sense of theatrical truth, I used my anger and rebelliousness and just went with it. Anger was just a part of me.","I took speech training. I took a few voice lessons in college.","I'm just dealing with what's happening, with what is. Joy, happiness, good, bad, all those terms are meaningless to me.","I'm tired of playing people who are complete washouts and bums. I don't mind waiting for the good ones to come along. It's like age. It's never bothered me. I've even forgot my birthday. Many times I've wondered if I should tell my real age, but now I think it's an honor, to be doing what I'm doing now at my age.","It's just so frustrating when you're in a supporting role because you only get to express a part of yourself.","Silence is the most powerful state.","Heisenberg, Max Plank and Einstein, they all agreed that science could not solve the mystery of the universe.","I've never seen a Western that was really truthful. Most are just morality plays. Good guys and bad guys - and the good guys always win, whereas in reality, most of the sheriffs were as bad as the gangsters they were after.","I think I'm blessed with a pretty tough psyche.","Sam Shepard is a brilliant writer.","Singing and acting are actually very similar things. Anyone can sing and anyone can be a film actor. All you have to do is learn.","I was offered a series by John Carpenter after I did the movie 'Christine,' and I would've been a leading man after that. I would have played a private investigator. And I was offered a great deal - I would be involved in the direction, casting, everything, and whatever. It was whatever an actor wants, and I didn't take it.","A friend is somebody who doesn't lie.","You want people walking away from the conversation with some kernel of wisdom or some kind of impact.","But I'm not imaginative. I couldn't look into the future, like Star Wars or Robots or anything like that.","I know little stories that happen to people around me, and I can repeat that in a way that has some color.","California is full of Mexican culture and Mexican music.","I don't believe in singing lessons. You can sing or you can't.","I have a good ear for languages.","I like to stay home and watch television. The Game Show channel, mostly.","I play myself all the time, on camera and off. What else can I do?","I really liked the Mariachi singing in Westerns.","I sing and play guitar and harmonica. I've been doing it for a long time.","I'm not really into religion.","I've never been ambitious about recording.","I've received a lot of compliments. People come right up to me on the street. They recognize me.","Speech lessons probably did more for my singing voice - they teach you breathing, resonance.","The band I've played with for 10 or 12 years now, we've been all over, but we mostly play in LA.","I realized early on that if I became an actor, I could play a writer and a sculptor and a painter and be all the things you just don't have time to be in your lifetime. I could get to learn about all of them.","I was in a movie called 'Twister,' and in it, I had to hit a golf ball off of a roof with a driving wood. The guy who owned the place where we shot showed me how to do it, and I hit the ball about 150 yards.","I'm very fortunate. I don't think anyone should have a job that they don't really enjoy.","I change every day. I'm still changing.","I've always been a searcher - you know, a hunter. I'm certainly not the only one. They say actors shouldn't get political and everything, but you can't separate yourself. You can't disconnect yourself from anything.","I'm big into Eastern concepts. The horror of life, the love of children, the whole phantasmagoria - it's all meaningless. Be still, and see what happens. All of life unfolds perfectly. You have to get beyond consciousness.","I watch television. Game shows - I hate the hosts and the people on them, and I love the questions and the answers.","There is no self.","My sister tells me I began singing before I could even talk. My first performance was of a song called 'My Blue Heaven,' which I began singing when I was a year and a half.","The first music I remember hearing was the traditional songs of Kentucky - things like 'Roll Along Kentucky Moon.'","I don't recall what the first record I bought was, but I definitely remember hearing Creedence's 'Born on the Bayou' and going out and buying it. The guitar and drums in that band were really good. I loved the words to the title track, and Fogerty's voice sounded just great.","For a musician to be good, he has to have humanity and care about the other guy. And as for blues - in a sense, black people have kept this country alive and given us our entire musical heritage.","Study up on the Eastern religions. They're the only ones that are realistic. There's no answer, see.","'Alien?' Oh, yeah. I still get fanmail almost every week, pictures from all over the world on that movie. That's one of the most popular films I've done.","I just wasn't psychologically made to get married or, God forbid, be a father.","I like to do nothing.","I do all the classics, like Dylan, Kristofferson, Jimmy Reed, Mexican mariachi songs, some jazz songs from the '30s. Cole Porter's 'Begin the Beguine,' that's one of my favorites.","The most terrifying thing for most everybody in the whole Western World is to take responsibility for your own life and to experience real freedom.","I've got a pretty iconoclastic attitude about all institutions myself. And I just think the church was corrupted right after Christ was killed.","I've been blessed. I've worked with a lot of good people.","Casting is a convoluted kind of trip. No one likes to be typed - even if you're a cab driver, or whatever you do.","I met Dylan on 'Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.' We buddied around for quite a while after that. We jammed together; he liked my Mexican songs.","I have to wait and see what happens. Because nobody's in charge.","I can't stress too much how much Ry Cooder was an influence on me. Having one of the most respected musicians around like my singing really gave me the confidence to do it.","People kept asking me, 'When are you singing again?' so I kept doing it. It was that simple.","People know you as an actor, and labels are so comfortable for people. That syndrome is always hard to get past.","I can understand why it takes some people a long time to really be a singer. You have to find out, 'Why am I singing? What am I doing this for?' I do it because I enjoy it, and philosophically, music is a catalyst. It's a refining agent.","'Paris, Texas' is the first film that I've totally cared about, the first movie I totally wanted to do - and that after 27 years that I considered my prison term.","I was in World War Two at the battle of Okinawa.","My father and mother were not that compatible. I don't think they had a good wedding night, and I was the product of that. We weren't close.","If I never did another film after 'Paris, Texas,' I'd be happy.","I think every actor wants to play those big parts. In the very first play I ever did, I remember understanding all the characters in it. I always felt I could play anyone.","All organized religions are basically the same.","I grew up Southern Baptist. In the Bible Belt.","I am an actor and this is holding the mirror up to nature, as it were.","I've had offers that could've made me much richer and much more famous than I am.","I've passed up opportunities. I've avoided the spotlight. I've never been to Academy Awards, didn't relate to them.","I made it a point not to graduate. I thought that was a positive, independent kind of statement.","I never liked being ordered around - which, of course, was an overreaction. I eventually found out that I didn't mind being ordered around at all when it was by someone who knew what he was doing.","I don't blame anyone but myself for the kind of parts I got. To blame external circumstances is absolute folly.","I hated being typecast in those roles. It was personally limiting, only playing stereotyped heavies. But I got those roles because I was angry, because that's what I projected. I was angry at my mother and father because they didn't get along, angry at the church. On top of that, I had an extreme lack of self-confidence.","'Paris, Texas' gave me a chance to play compassion, and I'm spelling that with a capital C.","I worked with the best directors - Martin Scorsese, John Huston, David Lynch, Alfred Hitchcock. Alfred Hitchcock was great.","I always had a dramatic flair. I'd like to dress up like a cowboy, play make-believe. But I didn't realize acting was something I had to do until I got to college.","The soul is an illusion.","I used to sing when I was six years old. When the family would leave the house, I'd get up on the stool and sing. 'T for Texas, T for Tenessee, T for Thelma, the gal that made a wreck out of me.' I was in love with my babysitter. She was 18. I was six.","I've had chances to record albums, which I haven't done.","My favorite films are 'Paris, Texas' and 'Repo Man.'","Nothing is important.","Every actor is a character actor.","I was singing the blues when I was six. Kind of sad, eh?","I could have made it as a singer, but I went with acting - surrendered to it, in a way.","I've worked with some of the best of them. Not just directors like Sam Peckinpah and David Lynch, but writers like Sam Shepard and singers like Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson.","You can do stuff onstage that you can't do offstage. You can be angry as hell and enraged and get away with it onstage, but not off.","When man began to think he was a separate person with a separate soul, it created a violent situation.","I'd love to meet Gandhi. And Christ. I'm sure he'd be interesting. And a lot different than a lot of people would think.","I think any performing artist can do films, or, as a matter of fact, anybody out there in the street can be a film actor with no experience whatsoever if you've got a good director.","What did we play in the Harry Dean Stanton Band? It was old blues and country - all covers. I never wrote anything.","The first film I ever remember - I think my mother took me to it - was called 'She Married Her Boss' with Melvyn Douglas.","I was trained on the stage, and I can do stage as well as I can do movies, but I prefer films.","I have nothing to do with anything that happens to me.","I had opportunities to be a lot more successful, but for some reason or other - the way I was particularly genetically wired - I turned down a lot of opportunities.","I could have been a lot more famous and played leading men and everything. For whatever reason, I didn't go for it.","Molly Ringwald, she's a natural talent. Every girl in this country related to that girl.","I do the same series of five exercises 21 times each day - an ancient Tibetan practice that stimulates your chakras.","I was in the Pacific. The Pacific Theater, as they say.","I sang barber shop harmony and sort of got into performing. And it just came naturally. Then, when I was in college after the war, I did a play, 'Pygmalion,' by George Bernard Shaw. And from then on, I knew that's what I wanted to do.","Fame in itself is, you know... It involves a whole discussion on just that word, 'fame.' It's a power; it's another degree of power, to be famous. I think it's obvious: you have more influence the more well-known you are. And, hopefully, it's righteously used.","I've avoided success artfully.","I liked 'Repo Man.' Satire.","Do nothing. Do nothing. Let it happen. Don't try.","I like to watch 'Paris, Texas,' but I have no desire to see it. I did it.","To put it mildly, I was just a very late bloomer.","I know I've got the ability to bring a sense of menace to the screen.

I cannot take my money with me when I die and I wish to enjoy it, with my family, while I live. I should prefer living in Germany to any other country, though I am an American, and am loyal to my country.","It is not unusual for the eye or ear to play tricks with one, but when such illusions and delusions are taken for the Spirit forms of the departed and voices of the dead instead of being recognized as some subjective phenomena brought about by a physical cause, the situation takes on a grave aspect.","Fire has always been and, seemingly, will always remain, the most terrible of the elements.","The eating of burning brimstone is an entirely fake performance.","But it must not be thought that I say this out of personal experience: for in the many years that I have been before the public my secret methods have been steadily shielded by the strict integrity of my assistants, most of whom have been with me for years.","Pickpockets either work alone or in pairs, or what is called a mob.","It is still an open question, however, as to what extent exposure really injures a performer.","The great day of the Fire-eater - or, should I say, the day of the great Fire-eater - has passed.","The pickpocket is usually very well dressed and of prepossessing appearance.","It is needless to say that women make the most patient as well as the most dangerous pickpockets.","Eating coals of fire has always been one of the sensational feats of the Fire Kings, as it is quite generally known that charcoal burns with an extremely intense heat.","In all feats of fire-eating it should be noted that the head is thrown well back, so that the flame may pass out of the open mouth instead of up into the roof, as it would if the head were held naturally.","A common pickpocket trick is for the operator to carry a shawl or overcoat carelessly over the left arm, and to take a seat on the right side of the person they intend to rob in a streetcar or other vehicle."],"Harry Johnston":["Long after this wonderful event in the Earth's history, when the human species was spread over a good deal of Asia, Europe, and Africa, migration to the American continents began in attempts to find new feeding grounds and unoccupied areas for hunting and fishing.","Nova Scotia as a British colony also came into being as another result of these adventurous British expeditions to North America in the reign of James I.","In 1628 came the first English attack on Canada.","Iceland, though it lies so far to the north that it is partly within the Arctic Circle, is, like Norway, Scotland, and Ireland, affected by the Gulf Stream, so that considerable portions of it are quite habitable.","As the winter set in with its customary Canadian severity the real trouble of the French began.

I have to be careful not to eat too much of it these days - but I do love it done medium rare, with peppercorn sauce.","I think self-belief is a massive thing in football. If you don't believe in yourself, not many others will. Work hard and believe in yourself, and I think you'll go as far as your body will take you.","I'd love to be captain of Tottenham and hopefully England as well.","I was a fan once, and I remember what it was like approaching footballers for their autographs. I used to get starstruck a lot of the time.","You come up against challenges in life, and it's how you deal with them that defines you.","Obviously, I am hoping to go on and win many trophies for Spurs and for England. That's always been the aim since I was a kid, dreaming of lifting the trophy one day for them, so that's what I've got to do.","At Norwich, I was injured, and then I went to Leicester, and I found myself on the bench. But I still used that to my advantage as an experience - I had to do that here at Spurs for a while, be on the bench and wait for my chance. It's definitely something that's helped me with my game.","I've always been working hard on my speed for the last few years. Obviously I'm not slow, but as a striker, the more speed you have, the better you are.","I want to keep working hard and looking to progress.","I went to see England against Switzerland at Wembley with my dad and brother, too. That was in 2008, Fabio Capello's first game in charge. Jermaine Jenas scored, and we won 2-1. I remember the national anthem was incredible. I sang it with pride - always do.","All goalscorers go on droughts. It is how you cope with that. And it is not just about scoring, it is about what you bring to the team, bringing others into play and getting assists.","I'm always disappointed when I don't score.","It is about doing everything you can so your body can perform at the highest level.","I take it season by season. I don't like looking too far ahead, because you never know what can happen.","I think I had set-backs, but I still always had that belief that I was going to play for Tottenham Hotspur. Even when I went out on loan to clubs, it was always to come back and be a Spurs player.","I am quite a calm player. I do have a go at players and refs in the heat of the moment, but I never throw my toys out of the pram.","All I can do is my best for the team, whether that's from the bench or if I start.","It depends on how my football career goes, but when I am finished, I would love to go the NFL and be a kicker. Even if I got to play just one game, it is something I would like to do.","I will always try to be as normal as I can. Obviously, there may have to be some limits with it, but I am still a fan at heart and want to live like a normal person.","I think sometimes managers like to buy players because they're more experienced from abroad or when they've got players under their nose that will give everything to the club they've been brought up with.","If I can be a role model, or if I can maybe make another manager play a young player coming through rather than buy a player, that's incredible.","When people think Arsenal had a bad season and we've had a good one, yet they still finish above us, it hurts.","When teams are dropping off, it's difficult, especially as a striker. You always have two centre-halves behind you and maybe a sitting midfielder as well. It's a bit more difficult creating chances.","I want to play every game, as does every player. But sometimes, you just have to listen to the manager.","I want to go and get more goals, create my chances for the team, and do my best for Tottenham Hotspur.","Maybe defenders don't always get the recognition like the other players get.","Watching all the football over the weekend - and having to wait until Monday night to play - gets you ready, gets you firing.","To go out at Wembley and score is what you dream about as a kid.","I can't remember the last time I went to a club.","It's the worst feeling in the world - losing, and losing in a final on the big stage is even worse.","All we can do is win our games.","You want the best players to be on form come the Euros.","Personally, I love training, and getting paid to play football is incredible. Playing the game and working hard is what I have always dreamed of doing.","The double sessions are tough. The manager wants us to get fit, wants us to work hard. And that's because the Premier League is so tough. We need it. Something we have to do.","You have to choose whether to take the money or follow your own ambitions, playing in the best league in the world and winning titles.","Vincent Janssen has come in and done very well. He's a great player and different type of player to me.","Nine or ten, I like playing both. I like to score goals, and I feel in both positions I can score goals.","Some people are motivated by money - I'm not one of them.","I am motivated by trying to win trophies.","I am happy at Tottenham. I go into work every day with a smile on my face, and that is important.","Money is a bonus of the job, but it doesn't always make you happy.","I'd say Dele Alli has got good style.","You can run in behind someone - one v. one, you're better - so I'm always trying to work on my speed. That's probably one aspect I've worked on the hardest as a player. I want to always improve on everything in my game, but that's one area I really work on.","It doesn't always click for a new player in a new team: you don't always go in and hit the ground running and score all the time.","Whenever a new manager comes in you want to impress him.","I'm in the team to score goals. I try and score as many as I can in the season to help the team out.","Whenever I'm on the pitch, I feel confident.","The manager and the fitness staff condition every training session. They plan it out week by week on what players need. If players need a rest, they will do that; if players need to work hard, they will do that as well.","It is down to the manager what he wants to do in the transfer window. Us as players, we just have to focus on each game that comes along and try and do our best.","Beckham was a great inspiration to me growing up.","I was a fan myself, and I know what it's like. If someone comes out of the blocks and scores 31 goals in one season, then you think, 'OK, was that a one-off, or will he do it again?'","I have a lot of self-belief, and I think it will happen. I think I will just get better and better. It's what great players do; they don't let up on anything. And I wouldn't do that anyway.","When I was growing up, Keane and Sheringham were my idols, and they wore 10. So it was always my dream to wear it.","I love this club, and to be wearing number 10 for Tottenham is amazing for me. I could not resist.","Teams buy players and change managers if they feel they need change at the club.","I remember the European Championships in 2004. Wayne Rooney was a special player in that tournament, and I definitely cried when we got knocked out then.","I watched all the games in the pub with my family. We used to go to a place called The Sirloin in Chingford. It was quite a good atmosphere in there.","I'm a very patriotic England fan, actually. I always wore my heart on my sleeve.","I am confident in my ability, as I always have been, and that I will be capable of maintaining my form, if not improving, year in, year out.","I try never to get too high or too low. You have to keep that medium.","In football, you have to grow up quickly, and you're generally more mature than other people your age.","I'm 23; I feel older than that, but I feel comfortable. I'm assured of myself, and it's not a problem.","It's harder to be angry at home when we lose. When it was just me and the missus, she didn't mind. She'd take the wrath of the loss! But it's harder when there's a little baby now.","Now we've got a little daughter; me and the missus won't talk about football as much.","I'm in my own fantasy team as well, so there's quite a bit of pressure on it.","I want to be a player that does everything he can to reach his ability, and I'll do that.","A lot of people say second seasons are harder than the first because people are now expecting you to do stuff, so yes, that's down to me to work hard and try and improve and, like I say, just letting my football do the talking.","As long as there's a vision with the club, and we're not stale, we're going forward as a club.","Tom Brady is a big inspiration and a big idol of mine.","Maybe when I was younger, people didn't always believe in me; they didn't think I would make it to where I am now.","It is about that self-belief, that self-drive, that has got me to where I am now.","There's no point playing up front just because you want to be the one who scores the goals. Make sure you have a knack for it.","I played in different positions as a kid, and it helped me learn different parts of the game, but I found that I was always scoring goals, and that continued as I got older. I've always enjoyed scoring, and it seemed to come naturally. Fortunately, that has carried on into my professional career.","Heading is still a vital part of being a striker, and it isn't about being the biggest player. Heading the ball is about timing, so work on that in training.","I'm at my most comfortable out on the pitch when I'm in front of goal with the ball at my feet. It's about being used to certain situations, and with time, you will find, chances don't get snatched at.","I've been to Wembley a couple of times to see England, but the match which stands out for me is the 2008 Carling Cup final against Chelsea. I was there as a fan with the family. That was a great day out.","I've always wanted to be a footballer, and I've always believed that's the path I was going to go down.","I always back myself as a finisher, but I always practise it as well. Every type of finish: left foot, right foot, headers, penalties, free kicks.","Sometimes, I put a couple of mannequins on the edge of the box and do these things called bounce balls. You pass against it, and it comes back; you take a couple of touches 'round the mannequins and shoot.","It isn't hard to practise finishing. You can do it on your own: just take a couple of touches and shoot at goal. You can do it with whatever equipment you have.","In a game, you never know what chance you're going to get, so I try and cover all bases and make sure I'm ready for that chance when it comes.","I remember washing Robbie Keane's boots and asking him a few questions. It's stuff you remember as a kid. You take that on and make sure you're a bit more hungry to go on and do what they've achieved.","If I can be a role model for kids, then that's fantastic. That's what I want to do.","The more players who come through the academy and make it into the first team, that's what we want. Not just for the club but for the country. If they're young English players coming through, that's fantastic. I'm happy to be part of that.","London derbies are that little bit more special; there's that little bit more feeling.","Anything I can do that will help me and the team, I'm happy to do it.","I do a lot of body weight stuff, power work, with your legs as well. There are weights involved now and again. There is a bit of mixture.","I don't want to do all weights. I want to get strong using my core and my natural power.","I play my best football when I'm calm mentally.","The Under-21s was a good experience for me and one I will take into the Euros.","Getting respect from the opposition is a nice thing.","I owe a lot to my family; we're a strong unit.","I love going to the Algarve and playing golf.","'Harry Brown' is good - and I love 'The Italian Job.'"],"Harry Knowles":["My entire generation has grown up in the shadow of one movie: 'Star Wars.'","Geekiness is that feeling of overwhelming passion for that thing in life that you focus on. Whether it be a nephew's first few steps or the timbre in one's voice when discussing the latest Cohen brothers film.","For the last 30 years our cinemas have been ruled by science fiction and horror. We've had some very good Fantasy films in that time period, but for my tastes I still haven't seen fantasy done to absolute perfection. That is the hope I have in this project.","That's when it hit me. The site is more important than me.","Film for me became how I related to everything else.","I specialize in cool inside movie news. Specifically, the news from movies that excite us fans.","My plan for the online version of 'Famous Monsters' is to become an online 'uncle' to an entire group of people who have never read or heard of 'Famous Monsters of Filmland.' The site will not be written in a scholarly fashion. It will be written in a playful, 'Hey, check this out!' kind of way.","One of the reasons so many kids bought 'Famous Monsters' was that it gave them ability to order 8mm and Super-8 versions of their favorite monster movies.","I want to create a kind of new monster language for kids to play with, pick up, and incorporate into their own vocabularies.","What I want is a way to put Universal monster toys back in the aisles alongside 'Star Wars' and all the other stuff and introduce today's kids to the classic monsters.","I grew up with Forrest J. Ackerman's 'Famous Monsters of Filmland' along with a plethora of movie tomes and wanted to write about film with a sense of personality, passion, and humor.","I wrote 'Ain't It Cool? Hollywood's Redheaded Stepchild Speaks Out,' because in doing hundreds and hundreds of interviews over the past six and a half years, I was tired of the story being half told or a third told or erroneously told."],"Harry Kroto":["Having chosen something worth doing, never give up, and try not to let anyone down.","Science is based solely on doubt-based, disinterested examination of the natural and physical world. It is entirely independent of personal belief. There is a very important, fundamental concomitant - that is to accept absolutely nothing whatsoever, for which there is no evidence, as having any fundamental validity.","You can be an idiot and survive because you just go to McDonalds for your food, and you go to work and do some sort of inane job, which is nobody taking any responsibility - it's always up the line - and then you watch the Super Bowl, and that's it. But in the old days, you really had to know how your world works. You don't need that anymore.","At no point do I ever remember taking religion very seriously or even feeling that the biblical stories were any different from fairy stories. Certainly, none of it made any sense. By comparison, the world in which I lived, though I might not always understand it in all aspects, always made a lot of sense.","Never, ever, compromise on science.","Scientific discoveries matter much more when they're communicated simply and well - if you can't explain your work to the man in the pub, what's the point?","I've always felt that the Nobel Prize gives me nothing as far as science is concerned.","I think the most important thing that young people should be taught at school is how they can decide what they're being told is true.","If doing something with second-rate effort satisfies you, find something else to do - where only your best effort will satisfy you personally.","Art and science are intrinsically the same except for one thing. The universe is in control of your science, whether it's right or wrong, and the public are in control of your art - if they're going to buy it, if you're going to make a living that way.","We live in a world economically, socially, and culturally dependent on science not only functioning well, but being wisely applied.","The laissez-faire attitude to science education has resulted in a disaster exemplified by the fact that more young people are opting for media studies than physics.","Many think of the sciences as merely a fund of knowledge. Journalists never ask scientists anything other than what the applications are of scientific breakthroughs. Interestingly, I doubt they ever ask a musician, writer, or actor the same question. I wonder why.","Scientific education is by far the best training for all walks of life because it teaches us how to assess situations critically and react accordingly. It gives us an understanding based on reverence for life-enhancing technologies as well as for life itself.","Saying that we should stop nanoscience is tantamount to saying we should stop science.","Imagine if we had stopped science in 1904. Yes, there would have been no nerve gas and no Bhopal, but there would also have been no penicillin. All science is a trade-off.","Without evidence, anything goes. Think about it. Common sense says the sun goes round the Earth. Who agrees with me?","You've accepted a lot of things without evidence. Find out what the evidence is for that. Find out what the evidence is for everything that you accept.","Human beings are just animals who will just eat and take advantage of any source of energy until it runs out, and then there'll be catastrophe.","It really does not matter whether one believes a mystical entity created the universe 5,000 or 10,000 million years ago - both are equally irrational, unsubstantiated claims of no fundamental validity."],"Harry Lloyd":["I consider myself straight, but if I met a guy tomorrow and fell in love with him, would I be brave enough to accept that without having to change the way I look at myself?","Adult fantasy gets a bad name. You think of Xena - Warrior Princess. If you don't do it expensively, it becomes tacky and you end up just appealing to 45-year-old single men.","If you're going to be related to someone it might as well be Dickens.","I just don't think any job is worth sacrificing your private life for.","My parents are Polish. I don't know anything about Italian-ness.","It's lovely to have a part that requires you to learn something that's also interesting.","There is a whole bunch of great British actors of my age who aren't film stars or theatre actors; they're very much both.","If I'm honest, the reason I got into acting is not the reason I'm still doing it, and if I'm still doing it in ten years' time, I'm sure I'll find something else.","My parents both work in publishing, and I was a bright, academic kind of kid, and I read a lot of books, and when you read a lot, I guess the muscle that gets exercised is where you can hear the voices in your head. You can turn words into pictures and into sounds and into colours and smells.","Peter Mullan is the least method actor around.","I believe your thoughts are your thoughts, but are you a human being in front of the camera, or an actor? They are two different things.","The interesting thing is, when you play a real-life character or someone based in a book, you always come up against people's preconceptions of what they have in their heads.","Part of George R.R. Martin's brilliant storytelling is taking the carpet out from under your feet.","As a child, I was fascinated by the stories of Dickens acting out everything in front of the mirror as he wrote it down. Later, when you approach his work as an actor, you notice how sayable the dialogue is.","It's always crude to link Dickens back to the blacking factory where he was sent to work aged 12 when his father was imprisoned in Marshalsea Prison for bad debt, but it was obviously a huge part of him.","I went to prep school, Eton and Oxford. When people hear that, they think they know you, and you think: 'No, you don't.'","I didn't want to be stuck in Dickens period dramas because then I would never know if I was any good.","I love my little flat in Spitalfields. Lots of actors live out of a suitcase, so it's nice to have a base to come back to.","I suppose the things you remember about someone who has died are the funny moments. Those are the ones that stand out.","The less friendly your relationship is on camera, the more useful it is to be friends with them off camera.","The whole world of 'Game of Thrones' was realized with such detail, with directors and writers who really geeked out and really loved all the little bits of it.","There's a burgeoning film scene in Romania.","I want to be an author."],"Harry Lorayne":["Curiosity killed the cat, but where human beings are concerned, the only thing a healthy curiosity can kill is ignorance.","Thinking clearly and effectively is the greatest asset of any human being."],"Harry M.

But financial engineers should know that's not true of a portfolio of correlated risks.","Portfolio theory, as used by most financial planners, recommends that you diversify with a balance of stocks and bonds and cash that's suitable to your risk tolerance.","I would never be 100 percent in stocks or 100 percent in bonds or cash.","I was born in Chicago in 1927, the only child of Morris and Mildred Markowitz, who owned a small grocery store. We lived in a nice apartment, always had enough to eat, and I had my own room. I never was aware of the Great Depression.","Becoming an economist was not a childhood dream of mine.","In 1989, I was awarded the Von Neumann Prize in Operations Research Theory by the Operations Research Society of America and The Institute of Management Sciences. They cited my works in the areas of portfolio theory, sparse matrix techniques and the SIMSCRIPT programming language.","The chief problem with the individual investor: He or she typically buys when the market is high and thinks it's going to go up, and sells when the market is low and thinks it's going to go down.","If the investor doesn't have enough time and skill to investigate individual stocks or enough money to diversify a portfolio, the right thing to do is to invest in exchange-traded funds that give you exposure to asset classes. It does make sense for the individual investor to think in terms of holding individual asset classes."],"Harry Mathews":["And then, when I left Princeton in the middle of my sophomore year, I went into the navy.","I'd been brought up on the Upper East Side in a WASP society, which was death on crutches.","When Niki and I moved to Paris, there was also the challenge of Paris, an extremely daunting city.","What I wanted to do and what I needed to do was something entirely different, and through reading Roussel I learned that I could do what I wanted all on my own and that I didn't have to rely on what had actually happened in my somewhat limited life and reading.","What I said about John was that he liberated me from my anxieties about writing in a correct, acceptable way.","Well, the great thing for me about poetry is that in good poems the dislocation of words, that is to say, the distance between what they say they're saying and what they are actually saying is at its greatest.","Well, my relationship to America at the time I left was very limited.","Well, I had this little notion - I started writing when I was eleven, writing poetry. I was passionately addicted to it; it was my great refuge through adolescence.","My next project is to get back to that. Actually, to learn how to write poetry. I'm not kidding.","My mother could never understand why I didn't write a thriller, which I've finally done.","My Life in CIA is the first time that I've ever written a story in my own name.","My idea was to go to Vienna to study conducting and perhaps play in an orchestra first, so I thought before I got to Vienna I could do with a little training in Paris.","My dream, I remember, when I went to boarding school, was to have a study all my own, a little nook someplace where nobody could get at me - nobody, like the football coach.","Music had been my first love among the arts, and I was fascinated by it, as I still am.","It's true, I had an extremely delicious life, but that was my life at home, and perhaps because I was only a child, or for whatever reasons, I found the company of others, especially other boys, quite terrifying and upsetting.","It has always been something I could do, and it may seem odd that in my case I seem to create an interesting narrative and frustrate the reader's opportunities to follow it at every step.","I was stationed in Norfolk, Virginia, for a while, about which the less said the better, and then I was in the Mediterranean, about which the more said the better.","I was immediately smitten with an attraction to this culture, not in the sense of high culture but of the basic way people behaved towards one another.","I thought Cheever was magnificent and that if I could write like him that would be the best I could do. And then I realized that what I really wanted to write had nothing to do with what he was doing.","I think situations are more important than plot and character.","I love teaching.","I left Princeton, but I graduated Harvard, in 1952.","I graduated in 1952 and went to Europe, with Niki and our first child Laura, who was then a year old.","I also had this mistaken dream, fantasy really - perhaps because I'm good at languages - of being able in both Italy and France to become someone else through my fluency in the language.","And I finished college because I thought how much it would upset my parents if I didn't.","After the navy, I transferred to Harvard and finished there. I was there the spring term of 1951 and I stayed through the summer term and a whole other year, so I was able to do two years in a little less than a year and a half."],"Harry Melling":["I was doing a show at the National Youth Theatre, playing an old man. Before that I had played fat clowns and I thought, 'If I want to have the career I would like, I am going to have to lose weight.' I was just starting drama school, and found I was moving around a lot. I also started to eat sensibly. The weight just dropped off.","Toffee Crisp was my downfall. I once ate five at a sitting. Do you really need that third helping, Harry? My parents didn't overfeed me, nor did they make an issue of it. That's when things go wrong. It doesn't have to be a problem for children to be fat, but it does affect you: you aren't as happy in that skin.","I can now shed the child-actor thing, like the fat, and start a new career, because no one sees me as Dudley.","I am a really bad traveler, I hate traveling and I hate being late so I figure if I could just click my fingers and be somewhere then that would be great!","I am not sure how much Dudley will feature just because of the grand scale of the film and the fact that there are so many stories and characters to tie up. I haven't seen the film yet but I think it will be a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment, but it was nice just to round it off and give it some closure.","I do look a bit different because Dudley was a very piggish character and about three years ago I lost quite a considerable amount of weight. It means that I can lead a normal life without the baggage of people running after me and shouting things at me.","I also started to eat sensibly. The weight just dropped off.","It doesn't have to be a problem for children to be fat, but it does affect you: you aren't as happy in that skin.","I am auditioning again - getting back to theatre would be amazing.","I've also just finished filming the role of Robert Brown in 'Just William,' which is due to transmit on BBC One at Christmas."],"Harry Morgan":["I'd like to be remembered for being a fairly pleasant person and for having gotten along for the most part with a lot of the people I've worked with.

I'm just interested in the perks. I'll do a series if I am picked up by a limo, work only until 4, and the show is shot in Hawaii.","A lot of people live much more simply than in the old days. That doesn't bother me. Keeping busy is the problem. Television guest shot fees are going down. You can do a dozen guest shots a year, but you're not making that much money.","Television allowed me to kick the Hollywood habit of typing an actor in certain roles.","An actor's most important responsibility is to know lines well.","If I had had to struggle at the beginning like most actors... I'd never have stuck it out. But having such complete success at the beginning, I was stuck with being an actor for life.","I've never been more comfortable in a part than with Colonel Potter.","The thing that made 'M*A*S*H' so good was the fact that we did have those relationships off-camera and took them on-camera.","There'll never be another 'MASH.'

For despair, optimism is the only practical solution. Hope is practical. Because eliminate that and it's pretty scary. Hope at least gives you the option of living.","I get nervous when they start shooting piano players.","It was just a typical London flat, but it was in a great neighborhood.

It's time we invested in America's future and made sure our people have the skills to compete and thrive in a 21st century economy. That's what Democrats believe.","This 21st century economy holds great promise for our people. But unless we give all Americans the skills they need to succeed, countries like India and China will take good-paying jobs that should be ours.","There's a lot we can do to improve American's retirement security, but it's wrong to replace the guaranteed benefit that Americans have earned with a guaranteed benefit cut of forty percent or more.","So the next thing I assume I'll be hearing from Republicans, they want to change rules some way, as they do on the House when you get a problem with ethics, they just change the rules.","The American people do not like privatization. They are afraid of the debt the president's willing to do. And they don't like benefit cuts. And everyone here should understand all 45 Senate Democrats are united. We are not going to let this happen.","I can't stand John McCain.","My Republican friends are lamenting reconciliation. But I would recommend for them to go back and look at history.","I think it would take a real stretch to think that I caused the problems with the economy.","So people have been hurting and I understand that. And it doesn't give them comfort or solace for me to tell them, you know, but for me, we would be in a worldwide depression.","People in Nevada know me from the street to the ring to the Senate chambers.

And I'm going to fight as hard as I can against President Obama on these earmarks and my Republican colleagues who hate to vote for them, but love to get them.","It has been my honor to support and work with President Barack Obama, a man who has brought courage and character to the presidency. President Obama's strength of character leads him to do the right thing, even when it isn't the easy thing.","Some said he shouldn't save Detroit. But President Obama made the tough and right call to save more than a million American jobs in an important, iconic industry.","Some said he couldn't take on the insurance companies that were ripping us off. But President Obama made the tough and right call to save lives, save Medicare and ensure no one goes broke just because they get sick.","We must stop the Tea Party before the United States Senate falls into the hands of extremists and ideologues who leave no room for reason or compromise, who don't recognize common ground even when they're standing on it.","We can move America forward with a strong middle class. We can move America forward with a strong Democratic majority in the Senate. And together we can move America forward with Barack Obama in the White House.","This nation has been through hard times.

You have to remember it isn't for you. It's for the Presidency.","You know that being an American is more than a matter of where your parents came from. It is a belief that all men are created free and equal and that everyone deserves an even break.","You can never get all the facts from just one newspaper, and unless you have all the facts, you cannot make proper judgements about what is going on.","The President is always abused. If he isn't, he isn't doing anything.","We shall never be able to remove suspicion and fear as potential causes of war until communication is permitted to flow, free and open, across international boundaries.","A President needs political understanding to run the government, but he may be elected without it.","Experience has shown how deeply the seeds of war are planted by economic rivalry and social injustice.","I do not believe there is a problem in this country or the world today which could not be settled if approached through the teaching of the Sermon on the Mount.","All my life, whenever it comes time to make a decision, I make it and forget about it.","Well, I wouldn't say that I was in the great class, but I had a great time while I was trying to be great.","I never gave anybody hell! I just told the truth and they thought it was hell.","In my opinion eight years as president is enough and sometimes too much for any man to serve in that capacity.","Study men, not historians.","Art is parasitic on life, just as criticism is parasitic on art.","All the president is, is a glorified public relations man who spends his time flattering, kissing, and kicking people to get them to do what they are supposed to do anyway.","Those who want the Government to regulate matters of the mind and spirit are like men who are so afraid of being murdered that they commit suicide to avoid assassination.","I have found the best way to give advice to your children is to find out what they want and then advise them to do it.","You can always amend a big plan, but you can never expand a little one.

I was a working actor from time to time but they thought was a little too much being a star of a series. They wanted me to have a slightly more normal childhood.","In the year and a half I was on SNL, I never saw anybody ad lib anything. For a very good reason - the director cut according to the script. So, if you ad libbed, you'd be off mike and off camera.","I'm at a little loss in terms of my Leave It To Beaver expertise, since I never watched an episode of the show - so the cast in the pilot could have been Martians or they could have been the regular cast for all I know.","I went to graduate school at Harvard for one year I worked in the state legislature in Sacramento for one year.

It was one of those typical '50s family comedies. I was in the pilot episode as sort of the dark presence: my character was called Eddie Haskill.","One of the problems with 'SNL' is that, if you tried to adlib, the director would put you off camera and off the mic, so only you would know that you ever did it. The director always directed to the script; he wasn't listening to what you were doing. He was calling shots whilst looking at the page.","To me, the funniest American of the Twentieth Century is Richard Nixon because he had the most to hide, and he was so bad at hiding it. To me, that's what's really funny - people who think they're doing a great job of hiding stuff, and it just keeps leaking out.","My family was lower middle class, and my parents both worked, so we couldn't take proper vacations. We'd go for three days to Santa Barbara or to the desert, so my first real vacation came was when I was 12, when friends of my parents were taking their kids away. We went to Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon, and Zion National Park in Arizona and Utah.","Bryce Canyon isn't as famous as the Grand Canyon, but it is just incredible - nothing compares to it.","People don't play music in New Orleans for the reasons they do in Nashville or L.A. - to become stars or to get rich - they play because they've got to.

I was in all the plays and all that. But dancing didn't come into my life until late into high school.","It was a big step, to go from not talking to people to stepping on to a stage. That's when I felt the most comfortable, because I could do anything I wanted to and say anything I wanted to, even if people didn't laugh.","When it comes to acting, you really have to create movement which in some ways is dancing. And dancing, I feel is very important to act as well. I wouldn't put one over the other.","I wasn't the guy who got straight As. I got As and Bs and a couple Cs.","I've always been a person with patience, and I don't like to force things.","I actually got dared to audition for the dance team.

Coolest job I did in that time.","When I was younger, I was very scared to talk to people. To the point where my parents took me to a therapist because they thought something was wrong with me.","Right before I jumped out of a plane, I knew what Superman felt like.","With parents, that's the only way sometimes that they can get across to their kids is by giving them an ultimatum.","My parents weren't stereotypical and pressuring me to go to college. They mentioned it a lot and constantly, but it wasn't a do or die thing, like, 'You have to do this or you're done.'","I started working when I was 9 or 10.","I have the most respect for Zach Woodlee. He is one of my favorite - and one of the most capable - choreographers out there right now.","The tour life definitely puts strains on your body, not just because of the dancing but because of the fact that you are traveling into the wee hours of the day, getting up early, going to sound check - just the grueling process of it all.","I'm actually really shy.","I'd rather dance in a corner than dance in a circle.","I'm heavily involved in the creative with choreographer Christopher Scott. I go to rehearsals with 'Glee' and then practice with LXD till about midnight.","When I came into the industry I started with acting and I did drama during junior high and high school. I fell into dancing as a hobby, but whenever you need work, you try out different things. So I booked a lot of jobs for dancing and it kept rolling and rolling.","I remember the first time I felt that I was sharing the stage with someone spectacular was dancing with Beyonce. It was the dancers, the band, Beyonce and me in front of thousands of people. That was sick. It was pretty amazing that I got to travel the world with someone like her.","I'm really into football, gadgets, adventurous activities, and cooking new, creative recipes right now - but you'll never catch me being boring.","When I'm off the clock, I usually play video games - or do something nature-y so I can contribute to Mother Nature.","Any Michael Jackson song will make any dancer go nuts."],"Harry Stack Sullivan":["Your emotional life is not written in cement during childhood. You write each chapter as you go along.","It is easier to act yourself into a new way of feeling than to feel yourself into a new way of acting.","All of us are much more human than otherwise.","I do not believe that I have had an interview with anybody in twenty-five years in which the person to whom I was talking was not annoyed during the early part of the interview by my asking stupid questions.","When the satisfaction or the security of another person becomes as significant to one as one's own satisfaction or security, then the state of love exists. Under no other circumstances is a state of love present, regardless of the popular usage of the term.","If you do not feel equal to the headaches that psychiatry induces, you are in the wrong business. It is work - work the like of which I do not know.","What you know about the people whom you know at all well is truly amazing, even though you have never formulated it.","There is no fun in psychiatry. If you try to get fun out of it, you pay a considerable price for your unjustifiable optimism.","When people approach you angrily, you take them very seriously, and, if you're like me, with the faint suggestion that you can be angry too, and that you would like to know what the shooting is about."],"Harry Styles":["That's the amazing thing about music: there's a song for every emotion. Can you imagine a world with no music? It would suck.","I think you have to be cool to be a good flirt, and I don't think I'm very cool.","You get moments all the time that kind of make you pinch yourself, some of them make you quite emotional. Winning a BRIT was a big moment because we were just so excited to be at the awards in the first place. Selling out Madison Square Garden was pretty amazing too. Then we woke to the news that our UK tour was sold out. It was crazy.","I went to watch Coldplay in Florida and saw Chris Martin before they went on. He sang 'What Makes You Beautiful' before the chorus of 'Yellow' kicked in. That was so strange because he's an inspiration for me. I think he's so good, he's sick... he's a really nice guy too.","I grew up with just my mum and sister, so I respect women a lot.","I can see how you could get dragged into the bad stuff, but I've got good friends around me, good family. I think I've got my head screwed on.","I've got a really good family; I've got great friends around me.","I don't want to be viewed as a womaniser or whatever. I don't like going crazy crazy, I like having fun but it's nice to wake up in your own bed, isn't it?","You're never going to get used to walking into a room and have people screaming at you. There's a lot of things that come with the life you could get lost in. But you have to let it be what it is. I've learnt not to take everything too seriously.","I think when you're writing songs, it's impossible to not draw on personal experiences, whether it be traveling or girls or anything. Just emotions.","I'm not really a pick-up-line guy. I don't know what I do.","You're always going to write and draw inspiration from things that you're feeling, things that you've felt. It's kind of impossible not to unless you're writing a song and there's an exact scenario that you're trying to write a song for.","Ages ago, my girlfriend had this little park near her house, with a bridge running over a stream... and I set up all these candles on the bridge. But when I called her and told her she said it was too dark and she wasn't coming out.","I'm an 18-year-old boy, and I'm having fun. I'm just not having as much fun as people make out.","I find ambition really attractive too - if someone's good at something they love doing. I want someone who is driven.","I meditate and pray before going onstage - it helps me focus.","I think, you know, we entered the 'The X Factor' in the U.K., and you kind of want someone who knows what they're talking about to tell you if you're any good or not instead of just your mum saying that you like it when you sing.","Quite a lot of the girls I get photographed with are just friends and then, according to the papers, I have, like, 7,000 girlfriends.","I wouldn't say I'm girl-crazy, because that makes me sound like a bit of a womanizer. That isn't really me. But I am quite flirty - maybe too flirty. I'm an 18-year-old boy, and I like to have fun!","I'm quite old-fashioned. I like going out to dinner. You have the chance to talk to somebody and get to know them better.","One time, a girl dropped her phone in my pocket and I found it and was like, 'There you go.' And she said, 'If you'd had my phone, you'd have had to meet up with me to give it back.'","I heard some stuff recently from Julian Casablancas, and his solo stuff is amazing. If I could write with anyone, it would be him.","A lot of the time, the way it's portrayed is that I only see women in a sexual way. But I grew up with just my mum and sister, so I respect women a lot.","To win one Moonman is amazing, to win two is incredible.","I miss my parents a lot. I obviously don't see them loads anyway because they live up north. But knowing that they're only a couple of hours away is a lot different than knowing that they're 12 hours away.","I'm a huge E! fan. Every hotel room, I watch it all the time. 'E! News' is fantastic.","You get a lot of who you are as a musician across through the music you write. If you're writing your own music, then it's important to be really honest.","I never like it when a celebrity goes on Twitter and says, 'This isn't true!' It is what it is; I tend not to do that."],"Harry Treadaway":["I was used to getting changed in pub toilets before going on set. Then suddenly I had studios in L.A. advising me on my hair.","You know the way that children play make-believe in the garden? I did that and I thought, 'This will do for life. Why would I want to do anything else?'","I'll always have a house in London; I'll always call it my home. There might be moments when I get to go and work in different parts of the world, but I'll always come back here.","'Ghosts' is the most incredible play I've read for years.","'The Night Watch' is a beautiful story about the pains of dealing with what you are.","I may live in London, but I'll go back to the country one day. My dad's an architect, so I would like him to design me a house. I'd love to be in the countryside when I'm older.","I was lucky, I had support from Mum and Dad - they said as long as you work hard, anything is possible. I never thought past those two things - that I liked living in imaginary worlds and that it is possible to do that for a living."],"Harry Triguboff":["A developer who is not optimistic shouldn't be a developer.","I've changed Sydney. It's my city, my people. I'm theirs. We belong to each other.","My properties are very good income-producing buildings, so I will have a very good stream of profit even if I can't sell.","The Chinese were good to us. The war years for us Russians in China were very good years.","The newspapers were always against me in the beginning because they thought I was depriving people of what they wanted.","I tried all my life to make housing affordable. The more affordable the house, the more money I make.","I deal in volume. To sell volume, it must be affordable. So that's my whole life, is to make it affordable.","Land values are going up a lot in Sydney, but it's feasible to build because prices are going up, too.","We can't express ourselves always at the time we should. Sometimes it takes time.","The government should spend more time on promoting tourism in Sydney.","I'm easy. Very easy. I'll tell you why I am easy. If someone is no good, I get rid of them. It is no good being tough on somebody who can't do the job. If he can do the job, then there is no point in being tough with him.","I fire very little because I try to be very careful when I select people. If you know how to select, you don't fire often.","This is a lifetime job. You don't look at it, you know, now and then. It doesn't really matter. When the market comes down, then I buy my land very cheaply, so I make my money on that.","It's a very difficult business, and I'm very interested in the future of it after I'm gone, and I thought that if I can't produce a strong management team here myself, and I can find better management elsewhere, then I should sell it.","I would consider selling the whole company; I wouldn't like to sell just part of it, but on the other hand, I have a grandson intent on following my footsteps and another grandson in another couple of years.","I looked around, and I saw cottages everywhere. I thought it was time they lived in apartments.","In this business, you don't have to be an architect or an engineer or a brick layer. But you have to understand how the money flows. That you can only understand if you're on the site.","In Sydney, we always have a deficiency of housing. So that's one good thing, which will cause real estate to keep going up. Not fast, but it'll go up.","If we allow more development, it will bring housing affordability.","Local councils are hostile to large developers and think that, by doing this, they are standing up for the community. But they're wrong.","The market is good when the local people are in it and believe in it and support it. That's what I want.","People have lots of money in super, but they have no money in the bank, and the super funds are not built to help people buy property.","If the banks become unreliable lenders, apartment prices will drop dramatically.","I don't think I have to combat Airbnb. It is like comparing Tiffany to a shop that sells things for one dollar.","There's always room for an operator like Airbnb, but it's quite a different thing to my serviced apartments. Airbnb is a different market - it has nothing to do with me.","We looked into and tested the Airbnb website and found the inquiries generated were at price points substantially lower than the market is prepared to pay us directly. It was clear that there were no real synergies between the level of our offering and what Airbnb clientele is looking for.","My interest is in the Wests Tigers. Nobody can support a team that is all the time on the bottom; that's a waste of time.","I'm a businessman, that's all.","I have never laid a brick in my life. But my people have laid more bricks than anybody else put together. Because I know how to pay.","I employ thousands of people, maybe 5,000 or 6,000. In my mind, they are all doing well. Because if they are not doing well in their minds, I'm not as strong as I could be.","I don't get involved in politics. I think that it is a waste of time and money because very often a politician cannot do much, and if you give him money, you embarrass him, so he can't do anything.","When the unions were fighting me 45 years ago, they could never beat me.","We had a Jewish school; we had a Jewish club. My father was a main donor. My mother was on the committee of the school.","I never built houses, only apartments.","I realized that we have to do everything we can to preserve the Jewish race. I'm very proud of it, and I think it's wonderful.","Chabad is very important because without Jewish education, Diaspora Jewry would disappear.","The newspapers were against me. They were telling me that the Australian dream was a home. But that dream became worse and worse as they had to live further away from the city. My dream became better as we could build higher and higher."],"Harry Vardon":["More matches are lost through carelessness at the beginning than any other cause.","Don't play too much golf. Two rounds a day are plenty.","I'm the best and I'll thank you to remember that.","A great deal of unnecessarily bad golf is played in this world.","To play well you must feel tranquil and at peace. I have never been troubled by nerves in golf because I felt I had nothing to lose and everything to gain."],"Harry von Zell":["As a designer, the mission with which we have been charged is simple: providing space at the right cost.","Radio is the most intimate and socially personal medium in the world."],"Harsha Bhogle":["Across professions, consistency is a direct product of work ethic.","Sometimes your greatest strength can emerge as a weakness if the context changes.","Sports teaches you there is always a second innings in life. If you fail today, there's a second innings maybe two days later. Maybe there's another opportunity coming up three or six months later. If you look at mistake as learnings and commit never to make a same mistake again, then you actually get better with every mistake that you make.","Cricket is not a rational sport in India, and we go overboard.","A monk's extraordinary patience can be a hindrance to desperate decision-making.","Like an author, a cricketer signs his name on every innings he bats or bowls in; indeed for every cricket ball that challenges him on the field.","Cricket, like all sport, offers glory to few and a lifetime of it to even fewer. For the investment it demands, it offers short careers that end when people in other professions are starting to flourish.","Among sportsmen are the noble, the diligent and the caring, as there are the callous, the cheats and the criminals.","To be a commentator, you must have a life outside cricket, too. If cricket is all that you know, then you would not be a great commentator.","For a long time, television said, 'We won't cover cricket unless you pay us to cover it.' Then they said, 'OK, the next rights are sold for 55 million dollars. The next rights are sold for 612 million dollars.' So, it's a bit of a curve, that.","There are no rules in live television.","I am a kid who played university cricket, so to be around international cricket is a blessing.","Cliches are cliches because they are true.","I always wanted to play cricket, and I have played competitive cricket to a fairly good level. I remember that my father used to come and watch me play. He used to love watching me play.","Cricketers are made to feel that they are very special. That is okay as long as cricketers realise they are only as good as their last innings.","Sports and management are not as diverse as people think.","Change doesn't always mean progress, but the status quo isn't always the best result either. It is merely the most convenient.","Conflict of interest and lack of transparency, though they are global features as we saw post-Iraq, almost define Indian cricket.","Cricket cannot afford to throw up meaningless games before its benefactors, which is what spectators and television audiences are.","Sometimes, quite out of the blue, sport will throw up a tender moment, when hostility ceases and an opponent is acknowledged.","One of the reasons you study at great institutions or aspire to work in great corporations is that you hope to acquire the values they stand for.","For its health, cricket needs to look outward to the sharpest minds, to people who sustain and nurture brands and often take hard but necessary decisions. Cricket cannot be bound by cricketing minds alone.","Traditionally, sport has looked down at number crunchers, but the reality is that they give sport the financial sustenance it needs.","In sports teams, apart from talk of sporting prowess and the imparting of inspirational thought, an extraordinary amount of time is spent discussing, and flaunting, material possessions."],"Harshvardhan Rane":["There is never going to be an end point. But definitely, I am happy to complete a certain part of my journey, and that's something I want to celebrate.","At the age of 16, I ran from my house, did odd jobs till l landed work on television and then in film industry. My first job was at an STD booth in Delhi. Then I came to Mumbai, where I distributed DVDs, and that is when I got my first TV show offer, 'Left Right Left.' I have never planned things in my career.","When I was a child, I got an opportunity to see all the big players in a cricket match. I was a ball boy outside the boundary line. I picked the ball and waited a bit for Sachin Tendulkar to come near me to give it to him. The sense of being in the same space was special. While thousands were watching, I was close to Sachin.","Simply put, Cavemen's diet is a diet plan which suggest food eaten by the cavemen. Cavemen ate what was available - like meat, vegetables and a few nuts. What we grow for food is carbohydrates, and that leads to weight gain. I started this diet a few years ago, and ever since, I haven't had carbs at all.","I believe the best friendships are forged with those you can be yourself with.","When people who are close to me say that they see positive changes in me as I grow, it makes me work harder on myself. Life always surprises us with something new, and I want to be capable enough to handle it.","I couldn't relate to the mindset of people in my hometown. Since I had no educational qualification, I only got menial jobs in Delhi.","I ran away from my home in Gwalior and bought myself a ticket to Delhi. That was the nearest metro, and the cheapest ticket was for Rs 74.","I was in a daze in my childhood mostly - always looking out of the window, waiting for some life to happen that I wanted to live. Now I realise it is this, and that's what got me out of Gwalior.","'Vicky Donor' or 'Madras Caf,' John's films have been path-breaking. I have full faith in the script of my movie, and my director, too, is a debutante. I like the conviction with which they work, and that gives me a lot of confidence.","For me, there's one film at a time, and my only benchmark is that my current film should be better than my last one, and I've made sure of that. If you Google the trailer of my first film - which I request you not to - you'll see the vast change in my approach towards my profession and the slow gain of maturity in performing.","I often end up travelling in my Jeep for long distance road trips.","In the time of social media, I get lots of wishes. It's overwhelming! What makes the day most special is the love I get from my fans, who try to make the occasion extra special. Almost 50 days before my birthday, they have started making plans. In fact, I have been receiving letters, too.","The fact that Sanjay Leela Bhansali wanted me to be part of his film was a high point in my life.","I load on proteins, veggies, fruits and nuts and never took support of supplements.","I took my time to learn the craft and procedure. I wanted to do some substantial work first in cinema.","I've learnt that there's absolutely no difference in Telugu and Hindi industries. Everything is almost identical. The only difference is that Hindi films have a wider release.","I just followed my gut feeling when I went to Hyderabad in 2008.","I learnt acting in Delhi from Barry John, who also taught Shah Rukh Khan.","Water is one of the most basic and vital requirements for survival. And with the issue of water shortage aggravating every single day, it's just something I felt we had to address and spread the message on whatever level we can.","When you have friends in the industry, you're always expected to talk about work. Seldom do you talk about stuff outside work with friends in the industry. Therefore, I don't have many actor friends, but I find lot of brotherly warmth from a few.","I wanted to do something new and different. People expected me to do negative roles. I wanted to break the norm, and because of that, I lost on some great work as well.","Shah Rukh Khan is a self-made man, and he does inspire with what he does. It is foolish to think that one can try and imitate or modify what he does. I have been original in my performances so far.","I am a big-structured guy, and so I always felt my weight was justified until I chanced upon Cavemen's diet.","I have lost close to 20 kilos, and it has kind of helped prepare my character for 'Sanam Teri Kasam.'","'Sanam Teri Kasam' is definitely my best Bollywood debut.","My life has been pretty unconventional. The publishers saw a story in it, and yes, my life has been put in a book.","I wanted to escape the drudgery of a small town existence. Any place bigger than Gwalior was fine. I took the first train to Delhi because that was the only fare I could afford.","From the time I was a child, I wanted to be an actor.","I've seen the best and worst of times. My parents were divorced when I was a child. I was brought up by my father.","I was shooting for 'Maaya' when I got a call from John Abraham's office. They told me about the film and asked if I could audition. But since I was shooting, I recorded my audition and sent them the tapes. The next thing I know, I was on board.","I so wish my dad was alive to see me do a Hindi film after acting in six Telugu movies. I sometimes imagine him giving me feedback on my work. But I derive strength from knowing he is watching over me.","Raashi is a lovely co-star, and we're having so much fun working together. We were talking about how our careers in Bollywood were launched by John Abraham.","I've only been in one relationship in my entire life so far. When that ended, I decided being with someone is not for me. I like my own company the best.","I don't deny that fact that I like Gauahar. She is hardworking, self-made and self-respecting. Somewhere, I see my own personality traits in her. But that's about it. We are not in a relationship.","I always try that my next film is different than my last movie. I would like to surprise my audience; that, I think, is the job of an actor.","I just can't stop doing Telugu films just when I have started speaking a little better Telugu.","There is nothing else to do in my life... I have no family, relationships - this is the only thing that I do.","I like Bejoy's style of movie making, and the music is always so good in all his movies.","I started watching English news channels and would repeat after the anchor. Since coaching classes were expensive, I joined a call centre where, after undergoing training for a month, I quit. I followed this strategy in 15 BPOs. I could earn money and learn English at the same time.","The idea of being associated with Bollywood prompted me to get into DVD distribution.","One day, I went to meet a film producer and entered the wrong flat. It was a casting agency, and they suggested that I audition for a four-hero Telugu film. I was confirmed a month later. Interestingly, it's not easy down South for a newcomer to bag positive roles, but I was adamant.","'Hiraeth' means homesickness to a home to which you cannot return: the grief of the lost places of your past. I fell in love with the word and instantly connected to it. It reminded me of the days when I had left my home in Gwalior, and I had that strange pull in my stomach, and now I can so relate to this word.","I love to put myself in a situation where I get to break a few things and construct a few cells in me.","As an actor, all I can keep my focus on is that I am a part of good projects.","I am a very big admirer of Bejoy's films and have waited for five months to be part of his film. But I have no regrets and will wait for an indefinite time as, if I love and believe in something, I do it completely and unconditionally.","'Satra Ko Shaadi Hai' is a very sweet film. It was the first film that I shot. I play a shy small town boy in it, which is an absolute contrast to what I played in 'Sanam Teri Kasam.'","I was distributing DVDs in Mumbai in 2006, and that is when I got my first TV show offer - 'Left Right Left.'","I strongly believe that when you are cast in a role, there will be similarity in the character and you - why else would you be chosen for the character?","My father looked like this serious guy but was actually a very kind person.","I had to go on the strict caveman diet where you eat only vegetables, chicken, and egg whites. This diet in many ways sounds right to me, and it has worked wonderfully.","I love travelling and exploring different places in India and around the world.","I must confess that I was not always the perfect boyfriend.","The idea of meeting my former girlfriend's current boyfriend seemed insane and absolutely bizarre to me in the beginning. But I am glad I gave it a shot!","For people like me, I think it is more about, 'When do people give you an opportunity?' rather than you deciding about when you want to make a debut. If I had a chance, I would have come as a child artist in this industry.","I'm happy that I could learn many things before entering Bollywood in 2015.","Everything about 'Avunu 2' will be many notches higher than its prequel. The sequel is scarier, and there'll be more thrills and chills. I myself felt it when I was shooting.","There's a misconception that actors with no background don't get any exposure from big production houses. I think people should start rethinking about it.","Just like how you find players from different backgrounds in Indian cricket team, our Telugu industry is looking for talent, and it doesn't matter where it comes from.","I don't think at any age I will be able to feel totally accomplished.","Accomplishments are very subjective.","I started working in an STD phone booth where I had to note down all the numbers that were dialed - this was post 9/11 when security was a looming issue. I got Rs 10 per day for my work. Soon after, a benefactor offered me a job in a cybercafe down the road for Rs 20.","I fled my home town and did odd jobs, including things like re-designing old furniture, before I became an actor. Having said that, I don't think the story of my life is in any way remarkable. What is remarkable is how acting opportunities have come my way.","I have learnt three things from Barry John which are applicable to life, too: Don't expect anything from another actor, one shouldn't judge, and one shouldn't block things.","I would do theatre till I die. Theatre keeps your honesty alive. You can't pollute yourself. You learn a lot, and you use theatre techniques in life.","I'm half Telugu. My mom is Telugu and dad, a Maharashtrian. I was brought up in Gwalior. I was exposed to English, Hindi, and Marathi. I heard my mom speak to her family in Telugu, so I got the hang of it.","I don't come from a film background, so I am free to work in any script that interests me.","After school, I started living on my own. After my dad passed away, I didn't know where to go and eventually decided to hang on here in Hyderabad.","I believe that anyone who chooses a path and keeps walking will find a positive result some day. I didn't want to go with the flow and do any kind of film that came my way and wind up my career swiftly.","I am stronger than yesterday and working harder than yesterday but don't know what will happen tomorrow.","Don't look at a person - look into the person. Heart is the hero, not the colour. I don't stand against or for any colour; I just believe in endorsing the idea of not endorsing any colour.","I spent my childhood trying to express myself, and I was not very good at it. In my town, most kids would take up engineering or medicine or something else, but acting was not an option.","I always wanted to do something related to the camera. When you are young, these are dreams you feel embarrassed talking about. You don't want to be made fun of. That would leave a scar on an young mind.","My father was a doctor, but his passion was making cars, and he was also very good at carpentry. He was a gem, and I don't blame him for not understanding me. When I told him that I would be leaving, he checked his pocket and took out 100-rupee note and gave it to me. He did not like that I was leaving, yet he gave me the money.","The first thing Ravi Babu asked when we met was, did I watch horror movies? I told him it took me years to get over Ram Gopal Varma's 'Raat!'","I don't naturally have the body language of a software guy.","Any passionate actor, if he is spoon-fed, will deliver.","I believe there is a shallow side to every actor, who craves to be presented well.","My father was like an unpolished diamond - tough outside but warm inside.","When people heard my voice, they were shocked that I could speak Hindi.","I want to constantly do better than my last film.","This is not that time of a cinema where you get 10 to 15 chances. You only get two to three chances, and if you do something nice in that, then it is great. Otherwise, people are very unforgiving.","Fashion is supposed to be fun, but killing animals for fashion is definitely not fun.","We are killing a living thing just so that we can wear it? I think fake leather is also beautiful and lasts longer. All I am saying is that if you like wearing leather stuff, put in some extra effort and explore the market. Take on fake leather and stop being part of this cruelty.","People used to call me for donations, and I couldn't relate to that because I have spent most of my life trying to support myself.","For a shot, I had to look like I've slipped on wet floor and hurt my back. My director wanted me to just act it out, but I insisted on doing it with water on the floor to make it look authentic. He was against the idea, but I did it and almost broke my back.","In 'Maaya,' I'm going shirtless for the first time in my career. My producer requested me to take off my shirt in one of the scenes. I have been working extremely hard to flaunt a perfect body for the scene.","I'm not going to have a six-pack abs. I think it's a luxury to have six-pack abs, but I don't think I can afford it yet. It's extremely tough, and I think having it will be an achievement.","As an actor, I want to do something I will be remembered for. I think 'Maaya' is that kind of film.","A rock star, according to my definition, is someone who inspires people around him with something he is best at. In my case, it's music, but I wanted audiences to realise there is a rock star waiting to be unleashed within them as well.","Most youngsters are so well-connected with the rock music circle that they will know instantly if I attempt to imitate any rock star.","It's a misconception that all singers need to portray a messed up, dirty look to prove their identity.","I know how to play the acoustic guitar, but I'm learning to play the electric guitar now. I'm sure it will be a wonderful experience.","Whenever I meet my friends, we talk about our teachers.","I feel it's tough to make friend when you're always thinking about work."],"Hart Bochner":["As an actor, I never go back and look at my work, anyway. The satisfaction comes in the doing.","Certainly as an actor, half of your work is not going to end up on the screen anyway, because in the editorial process, they need to cut to the other actor in the scene. Very often, your best work ends up on the cutting room floor, because it just doesn't work with the overall narrative drive of the story.","I love directing more than anything in the world, and I love being in the editing room. I love cutting. When I'm shooting, I cut it in my head anyway. That's not to say that it always turns out that way, but you have a sense when you're composing a sequence or a scene how you want it to look anyway.","I think every actor should direct at least once and vice versa.","I admire President Obama's class and measure."],"Hart Crane":["The form of my poem rises out of a past that so overwhelms the present with its worth and vision that I'm at a loss to explain my delusion that there exist any real links between that past and a future worthy of it.","The bottom of the sea is cruel.","I got so I simply gagged everytime I sat before my desk to write an ad.","And I have been able to give freedom and life which was acknowledged in the ecstasy of walking hand in hand across the most beautiful bridge of the world, the cables enclosing us and pulling us upward in such a dance as I have never walked and never can walk with another.","And inasmuch as the bridge is a symbol of all such poetry as I am interested in writing it is my present fancy that a year from now I'll be more contented working in an office than ever before.","It has taken a great deal of energy, which has not been so difficult to summon as the necessary patience to wait, simply wait much of the time - until my instincts assured me that I had assembled my materials in proper order for a final welding into their natural form.","The fact that The Bridge contains folk lore and other material suitable to the epic form need not therefore prove its failure as a long lyric poem, with interrelated sections.","I think the sea has thrown itself upon me and been answered, at least in part, and I believe I am a little changed - not essentially, but changed and transubstantiated as anyone is who has asked a question and been answered.","Your primary presumption that The Bridge was proffered as an epic has no substantial foundation. You know quite well that I doubt that our present stage of cultural development is so ordered yet as to provide the means or method for such an organic manifestation as that."],"Hartley William Shawcross":["Criticising the other fellow because he's in and you are not seems to me a futile waste of time.","There comes a point when a man must refuse to answer to his leader if he is also to answer to his own conscience."],"Hartmut Michel":["The future of our individual transport has to be electric!","Because of the low photosynthetic efficiency and the competition of energy plants with food plants for agricultural land, we should not grow plants for biofuel production. The growth of such energy plants will undoubtedly lead to an increase in food prices, which will predominantly hit poorer people.","At age eleven, I became a member of the circulating library of my home town. From there on I was rarely seen outside but was reading two to four books per week, the subjects ranging from archaeology over ethnology and geography to zoology. Needless to say that I did not do much homework.","I was born in Ludwigsburg, Wuerttemberg, in the southwestern part of the Federal Republic of Germany on July 18, 1948, as the elder son of Karl and Frieda Michel. My ancestors lived in that area for generations, mainly as farmers.","As a child, I liked to play outside, to stroll through the fields, and I was an active member of the local children's gang, frequently being chased by field guards and building supervisors. Nevertheless, my performance at school was very good, and mainly due to the influence of my mother, I was allowed to attend high school.","At school, my favorite subjects were history, biology, chemistry, and physics. Especially the teaching in physics was excellent. Most of my understanding of it I got at high school, not at the university.","When the yields of biofuels per hectare are known, one can easily calculate how much of the energy of the sunlight is stored in the biofuels.","Improving photosynthesis, although a highly important goal towards securing food security, cannot change the superiority of the combination photovoltaic cells/electric battery/electric engine."],"Haruki Murakami":["If you remember me, then I don't care if everyone else forgets.","Please think of me like an endangered species and just observe me quietly from far away. If you try to talk to me or touch me casually, I may get intimidated and bite you. So please be careful.","Concentration is one of the happiest things in my life.","I'm not intelligent. I'm not arrogant. I'm just like the people who read my books. I used to have a jazz club, and I made the cocktails and I made the sandwiches. I didn't want to become a writer - it just happened.","When I am writing, I do not distinguish between the natural and supernatural. Everything seems real. That is my world, you could say.","Young people these days don't trust anything at all. They want to be free.","Most young people were getting jobs in big companies, becoming company men. I wanted to be individual.","You have to dream intentionally. Most people dream a dream when they are asleep. But to be a writer, you have to dream while you are awake, intentionally.","Confidence, as a teenager? Because I knew what I loved. I loved to read; I loved to listen to music; and I loved cats. Those three things. So, even though I was an only kid, I could be happy because I knew what I loved.","Everything passes. Nobody gets anything for keeps. And that's how we've got to live.","I collect records. And cats. I don't have any cats right now. But if I'm taking a walk and I see a cat, I'm happy.","I've run the Boston Marathon 6 times before. I think the best aspects of the marathon are the beautiful changes of the scenery along the route and the warmth of the people's support. I feel happier every time I enter this marathon.","Before I became a writer, I was running a jazz bar in the center of Tokyo, which means that I worked in filthy air all the time late into the night. I was very excited when I started making a living out of my writing, and I decided, 'I will live in nothing but an absolutely healthy way.'","Most near-future fictions are boring. It's always dark and always raining, and people are so unhappy.","For me, writing a novel is like having a dream. Writing a novel lets me intentionally dream while I'm still awake. I can continue yesterday's dream today, something you can't normally do in everyday life.","In Japan, the writers have made up a literary community, a circle, a society. I think 90 percent of Japan's writers live in Tokyo. Naturally, they make a community. There are groups and customs, and so they are tied up in a way.","You are 27 or 28 right? It is very tough to live at that age. When nothing is sure. I have sympathy with you.","I didn't want to be a writer, but I became one. And now I have many readers, in many countries. I think that's a miracle. So I think I have to be humble regarding this ability. I'm proud of it and I enjoy it, and it is strange to say it this way, but I respect it.","If you want to talk about something new, you have to make up a new kind of language.","My heroes don't have anything special. They have something to tell other people but they don't know how, so they talk to themselves.","There's no such thing as perfect writing, just like there's no such thing as perfect despair.","I have always liked running, so it wasn't particularly difficult to make it a habit. All you need is a pair of running shoes and you can do it anywhere. It does not require anybody to do it with, and so I found the sport perfectly fits me as a person who tends to be independent and individualistic.","I just wanted to write something about running, but I realized that to write about my running is to write about my writing. It's a parallel thing in me.","Many people, especially young people, would like to be more independent and on their own. But it is very difficult and they suffer from feelings of isolation. I think that is one reason why young readers support my work.","Among the many values in life, I appreciate freedom most.","I could have been a cult writer if I'd kept writing surrealistic novels. But I wanted to break into the mainstream, so I had to prove that I could write a realistic book.","Stories lie deep in our souls. Stories lie so deep at the bottom of our hearts that they can bring people together on the deepest level. When I write a novel, I go into such depths.","Most people dream a dream when they are asleep. But to be a writer, you have to dream while you are awake, intentionally. So I get up early in the morning, 4 o'clock, and I sit at my desk and what I do is just dream. After three or four hours, that's enough. In the afternoon, I run. The next day, the dream will continue.","When I write about a 15-year old, I jump, I return to the days when I was that age. It's like a time machine. I can remember everything. I can feel the wind. I can smell the air. Very actually. Very vividly.","I am 55 years old now. It takes three years to write one book. I don't know how many books I will be able to write before I die. It is like a countdown. So with each book I am praying - please let me live until I am finished.","It is hard to be an individual in Japan.","In Japan they prefer the realistic style. They like answers and conclusions, but my stories have none. I want to leave them wide open to every possibility. I think my readers understand that openness.","I lost some of my friends because I got so famous, people who just assumed that I would be different now. I felt like everyone hated me. That is the most unhappy time of my life.","If you cannot concentrate, you are not so happy.","I'm kind of a big kettle. It takes time to get boiled, but then I'm always hot.","I don't get bored.","I'm not a fast thinker, but once I am interested in something, I am doing it for many years.","I don't think of myself as an artist. I'm just a guy who can write.","It's physical. If you keep on writing for three years, every day, you should be strong. Of course you have to be strong mentally, also. But in the first place you have to be strong physically. That is a very important thing. Physically and mentally you have to be strong.","Every day I go to my study and sit at my desk and put the computer on. At that moment, I have to open the door. It's a big, heavy door. You have to go into the Other Room. Metaphorically, of course. And you have to come back to this side of the room. And you have to shut the door.","You have to be practical. So every time I say, if you want to write a novel you have to be practical, people get bored. They are disappointed. They are expecting a more dynamic, creative, artistic thing to say. What I want to say is: you have to be practical.","Writing is fun - at least mostly. I write for four hours every day. After that I go running. As a rule, 10 kilometers (6.2 miles). That's easy to manage.","A fortunate author can write maybe twelve novels in his lifetime.","I don't know how many good books I still have in me; I hope there are another four or five.","Team sports aren't my thing. I find it easier to pick something up if I can do it at my own speed. And you don't need a partner to go running, you don't need a particular place, like in tennis, just a pair of trainers.","I began running on an everyday basis after I became a writer. As being a writer requires sitting at a desk for hours a day, without getting some exercise you'd quickly get out of shape and gain weight, I figured.","I know how fiction matters to me, because if I want to express myself, I have to make up a story. Some people call it imagination. To me, it's not imagination. It's just a way of watching.","I didn't read so much Japanese literature. Because my father was a teacher of Japanese literature, I just wanted to do something else.","You know, if you are kind of rich, the best thing is that you don't have to think about money. The best thing you can buy with money is freedom, time. I don't know how much I earn a year. I have no idea. I don't know how much I pay in taxes.","I like to read books. I like to listen to music.","Since I have come to America, I am often asked whether my next novel will be set in America. I don't think it will. I think I will be living in America for some time to come, but while living in America, I would like to write about Japanese society from the outside.","When I was a teenager, I thought how great it would be if only I could write novels in English. I had the feeling that I would be able to express my emotions so much more directly than if I wrote in Japanese.","In my younger days, I was trying to write sophisticated prose and fantastic stories.","I don't want to express my opinion about actual politics, because if I do, I have to be responsible for my decision.","I'm a writer. I don't support any war. That's my principle.","My priority is my books, at least at this point. What I have to do is write the narrative of this time.","Every writer has his writing technique - what he can and can't do to describe something like war or history. I'm not good at writing about those things, but I try because I feel it is necessary to write that kind of thing.","My father belongs to the generation that fought the war in the 1940s. When I was a kid my father told me stories - not so many, but it meant a lot to me. I wanted to know what happened then, to my father's generation. It's a kind of inheritance, the memory of it.","I myself have been on my own and utterly independent since I graduated. I haven't belonged to any company or any system. It isn't easy to live like this in Japan.","When I start to write, I don't have any plan at all. I just wait for the story to come.","It's true that at the time I was fond of Kurt Vonnegut and Richard Brautigan, and it was from them that I learned about this kind of simple, swift-paced style, but the main reason for the style of my first novel is that I simply did not have the time to write sustained prose.","Some people think literature is high culture and that it should only have a small readership. I don't think so... I have to compete with popular culture, including TV, magazines, movies and video games.","I get up early in the morning, 4 o'clock, and I sit at my desk and what I do is just dream. After three or four hours, that's enough. In the afternoon, I run.","Whenever I write a novel, music just sort of naturally slips in (much like cats do, I suppose).","I am worrying about my country. I feel I have a responsibility as a novelist to do something.","I have no models in Japanese literature. I created my own style, my own way.","I've been running a full marathon every year for more than 20 years, and my record is getting worse. Getting older, getting worse. It's natural.","I used to run a full marathon in three hours and 25 or 26 minutes. Not any more.","I'm a writer, not a professional runner. It's fun and it helps me write. I need powerful concentration.","Mere humans who root through their refrigerators at three o'clock in the morning can only produce writing that matches what they do. And that includes me.","Many people tell me that they don 't know what to feel when they finish one of my books because the story was dark, or complicated, or strange. But while they were reading it, they were inside my world and they were happy. That's good.","As a novelist, you could say that I am dreaming while I am awake, and every day I can continue with yesterday's dream. Because it is a dream, there are so many contradictions and I have to adjust them to make the story work. But, in principle, the original dream does not change.","I had no ambition to be a writer because the books I read were too good, my standards were too high.","I started writing at the kitchen table after midnight. It took ten months to finish that first book; I sent it to a publisher and I got some kind of prize, so it was like a dream - I was surprised to find it happening.","George Orwell is half journalist, half fiction writer. I'm 100 percent fiction writer... I don't want to write messages. I want to write good stories. I think of myself as a political person, but I don't state my political messages to anybody.","If you keep on writing for three years, every day, you should be strong. Of course, you have to be strong mentally, also. But in the first place, you have to be strong physically. That is a very important thing. Physically and mentally you have to be strong.","Sometimes I wonder why I'm a novelist right now. There is no definite career reason why I became a writer. Something happened, and I became a writer. And now I'm a successful writer.","I had my jazz club and I had enough money. So I didn't have to write for my living.","Whenever I write a novel, I have a strong sense that I am doing something I was unable to do before. With each new work, I move up a step and discover something new inside me.","For novelists or musicians, if they really want to create something, they need to go downstairs and find a passage to get into the second basement. What I want to do is go down there, but still stay sane.","I try not to think about anything special while running. As a matter of fact, I usually run with my mind empty. However, when I run empty-minded, something naturally and abruptly crawls in sometime. That might become an idea that can help me with my writing.","As long as possible, I would really like to complete one marathon per year. Though my time has been slowing down as I get older, it has become a very important part of my life.","I was enjoying myself writing, because I don't know what's going to happen when I take a ride around that corner. You don't know at all what you're going to find there. That can be thrilling when you read a book, especially when you're a kid and you're reading stories.","I think history is collective memories. In writing, I'm using my own memory, and I'm using my collective memory."],"Harvey Ball":["The catch phrase for the day is 'Do an act of kindness. Help one person smile.'","I made a circle with a smile for a mouth on yellow paper, because it was sunshiny and bright.","There are two ways to go about it. You can take a compass and draw a perfect circle and make two perfect eyes as neat as can be. Or you can do it freehand and have some fun with it. Like I did. Give it character."],"Harvey Cox":["All human beings have an innate need to hear and tell stories and to have a story to live by. religion, whatever else it has done, has provided one of the main ways of meeting this abiding need.","Not to decide is to decide.","Sermons remain one of the last forms of public discourse where it is culturally forbidden to talk back.","What we are seeking so frantically elsewhere may turn out to be the horse we have been riding all along.","There has never been a better raconteur than Jesus of Nazareth."],"Harvey Cushing":["I would like to see the day when somebody would be appointed surgeon somewhere who had no hands, for the operative part is the least part of the work.","In these days when science is clearly in the saddle and when our knowledge of disease is advancing at a breathless pace, we are apt to forget that not all can ride and that he also serves who waits and who applies what the horseman discovers.","A physician is obligated to consider more than a diseased organ, more even than the whole man - he must view the man in his world.","Standardization of our educational systems is apt to stamp out individualism and defeat the very ends of education by leveling the product down rather than up.","The capacity of man himself is only revealed when, under stress and responsibility, he breaks through his educational shell, and he may then be a splendid surprise to himself no less than to this teachers."],"Harvey Fierstein":["I do believe we're all connected. I do believe in positive energy. I do believe in the power of prayer. I do believe in putting good out into the world. And I believe in taking care of each other.","It's a wonderful world. You can't go backwards. You're always moving forward. It's the wonderful part about life. And that's terrific.","Nothing binds a people to their leader like a common enemy. Voters don't change governments during war.","Art has the power to transform, to illuminate, to educate, inspire and motivate.","Time will tell us what we did and didn't do.","I am thrilled - I can't stress that enough - thrilled when I see kids getting active.","The great thing about suicide is that it's not one of those things you have to do now or you lose your chance. I mean, you can always do it later.","Never be bullied into silence. Never allow yourself to be made a victim. Accept no one's definition of your life; define yourself.","To me, if a heterosexual has a right to do it, then I have a right to do it. And if it's important to the gay youth - who are now setting the agenda - then its important to me.","A child's kiss is magic. Why else would they be so stingy with them?","When a politician like Marco Rubio is willing to sacrifice his career defining immigration reform legislation solely to insure that gays and lesbians are denied equal protection under the law, we have to admit that we're under attack. This is not pragmatic politics at work. These are the policies of bias, exclusion and unfairness.","Anyone with a smart phone is a potential eyewitness cameraman capturing and transmitting stories at speeds that turn Reuter photos and traditional reporting into, well... yesterday's news.","Theater is my temple and my religion and my act of faith. Strangers sit in a room together and believe together.","Movies are all about plot. Theater, even if it's story heavy, it's about ideas. Theater has to resonate in your heart in a way that movies don't.","Beware of anyone who says they know. Trust me, they don't, or they wouldn't have to say they did.","If you deny yourself commitment, what can you do with your life?","How time files when you's doin' all the talking.","In London they don't like you if you're still alive.","I got the regular call, that they were doing a Broadway musical of Hairspray, and would I come and audition. I was familiar with the movie, because at the time it came out my lover wrote for Premiere magazine, and we had to see everything.","But actually just yesterday we raised the key of one of my songs two steps up, so my voice is obviously responding. It's a muscle, and the more you use it, the more you use it right, the more you should get out of it. So yes, I sing.","It's a lot of fun to play someone you don't normally think of yourself as.","You know, I always got offered other stuff. Not the romantic leads, obviously. But very often it's a role that's underwritten, where the character has no personality at all. And they need a character actor who can fill it in.","What looks absolutely fabulous in rehearsal can fall flat in front of an audience. The audience dictates what you do or don't change.","But I'm not adverse to the idea of Torch Song as a musical. It would just be different. Because the play will always be there exactly as it was, and in a musical you could tell a lot of the story through songs.","It's through sheer will that I can sing.","Actually, I think the average voice is like 70 percent tone and 30 percent noise. My voice is 95 percent noise.","The world is full of more interesting things than my voice.","I'm sure there's going to be some material from This Is Not Going To Be Pretty. I usually use that song to just introduce myself to the audience, although the patter in between the song is always different.","So, did I work with Warhol? I worked with him less on that play then I did on other things. He actually did a portrait of my rabbit and some other stuff. Warhol was definitely... Warhol.","Pork was in 1971, and I stopped hanging out at The Factory by like 1973.","You really, really, really have to love what you are going to do in theater because it is an unmerciful life. It's six days a week. It's eight performances a week. And that's doing the exact same thing over and over and over again.","In Torch Song, I did that character almost non-stop from 1978 until I made the movie in 1987. Then I had some failure, which also colors how you react to doing other things.","My play Safe Sex was picked apart because critics thought it was untrue. It was a play in which no one had AIDS, but the characters talked about how it was going to change their lives.","Also, if you want to reach people, theatre is not always the best way to do it.","And I believe that you never be limited in what you do, so I like to do movies, I like to do television.","I actually may do a musical next year... not one that I've written; one that I may star in. Plus my concert and other people's work and all of a sudden you've got a very full life.","Well, I always looked at Mulan as a movie about a lesbian coming out.","There are times when I don't take roles because I don't want to be perceived a certain way.","To work all the time is to be incredibly lucky.","When I write stuff and I help cast it, I turn away good people all the time. I may turn them down because this one's too tall and that one doesn't have a high enough voice or this one looks to old to match up with that one - there's a billion reasons not to hire somebody.","It would be nice to redefine ourselves - at the moment we are drowning in diversity. That's not a bad thing, its just going to take a while before we refocus.","Political movements always belong to the young.","I burned out on AIDS and did no AIDS work for a couple of years. I was so angry that people were still getting this disease that nobody can give you - you have to go out and get it!","I actually pray everyday, but I don't believe in God.","Always admit when you're wrong. You'll save thousands in therapy... and a few friendships too.","Theater has to resonate in your heart in a way that movies don't.","Movies are all about plot. Theater, even if it's story heavy, it's about ideas.","My father was brought up in an orphanage in the Catskills. He was a factory worker. And because his family wasn't there for him, family was everything. We could disagree inside the house, but outside the house it was us against the world. So when I became a drag actor, he looked sideways but said okay.","I don't believe in the afterlife, so I do think when somebody passes, it's worthy of note.","I got a lovely check today from being a writer that I earned by sitting at home. That's rewarding.","I have to work really hard, eight shows a week, to get a nice check as an actor. But when I write a play, and it's a - knock wood - hit, the checks come in for many years.","You may feel powerless as a child, but the world will one day be yours. And you're responsible for it. So, seize the day and take charge of it.","As soon as I started writing, other writers stopped wanting me acting in their shows - maybe they thought I was going to rewrite them.","I really am a theater person. That means you put something out there, and you let it go. Tomorrow night is a new performance.","I have a lot of faith in President Obama. The thing that seems to be true of him is that he doesn't speak when you would expect him to speak. He's very measured in his response to things. He likes to get all the facts first before he shoots his mouth off. It makes me crazy; it makes a lot of people crazy.","I just don't like politics. My rule is if I can put a spotlight on something, I'll do that.","I have great faith in the United States. It's the only country I would ever live in.","How often are the perpetrators of hate-crimes discovered to be self-loathing? Valued individuals do not strike out against strangers.","While we dance in the streets and pat ourselves on the back for being a nation great enough to reach beyond racial divides to elect our first African-American president, let us not forget that we remain a nation still proudly practicing prejudice.","State-sanctioned marriage is a civil contract, period. A contract is not a judgment of moral value. It is a legal agreement between two parties that testifies to a meeting of minds between those consenting entities. It is not a religious act or rite and so has nothing to do with Adam and Eve or Steve or even Harvey.","I often say that if you want to really want to understand the contract of marriage, just ask anyone who has been divorced. The marriage contract is one of property rights. Or maybe you can look in the Bible to see what Adam had to say about divorce, since Eve was his second wife.","A musical takes two to five years. You have to love it to put in the years.","I was exposed to a mix of cultures, lots of different religions and beliefs. I was a spiritual kid and went to Indian powwows and Buddhist temples. But over a period of time, with reading and thinking, I started to feel it was all so absurd: The whole idea of life after death is ridiculous.","When I went into 'Fiddler,' I wondered about the response I'd get - the backlash because I'm openly gay. There was none. I toured Canada and America, and not one single review suggested that I played the role gay or that I seemed anything but Tevye.","I have the world's worst taste in men, so now I simply have wonderful relationships of the friend kind, but trying to settle down with somebody? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm beyond that.","I've been dating since I was 15 years old, and I just don't seem to do it well."],"Harvey Gantt":["I'm from North Carolina, and I stand here humbled, honored, and proud to place in nomination for the office of vice-president of the United States of America, my friend and my senator from the great state of North Carolina: John Edwards.","John Edwards comes from working folk, just like me. John Edwards worked hard and excelled to get his education, just like me.","When you are raised, as John Edwards was, in a small town like Robbins, North Carolina, you get to understand poverty and unemployment, or inadequate health care, first-hand by seeing the daily struggles of your friends and neighbors.","John Edwards makes us all proud to be Americans, and those of us from North Carolina are even more proud to claim him, for he represents the best that we can offer America at a time when strong, positive leadership is needed.","There has to be life after the Charlotte Mayor's office.","Jesse Helms has never been an invincible man.","Every race I've been in, I calculated race into the equation. If you're in America, you calculate it into the equation. It is a factor. I never make it an issue. I don't run the campaign wearing it on my sleeve, but I don't run away from it, either.","In my wildest dreams, I never would have thought we'd come to the point where were talking about the re-election of a black president."],"Harvey Keitel":["The way I see things, the way I see life, I see it as a struggle. And there's a great deal of reward I have gained coming to that understanding - that existence is a struggle.","I don't think about those things, really. I work hard on everything I do. Everything is a struggle, everything is hard, everything is difficult.","I've always found it not only easy, but enjoyable. It's necessary for us to reach out and I'm speaking for myself here. I certainly have a sense of responsibility to reach out to these people in the theatre who might look to someone like me for some guidance.","Well, we are not doing that film actually. At least I am not at the moment, but we are making an effort to get it done; I don't know whether we'll get the financing for it. The old story we had it, it fell out of place and this and that.","To create characters, one must build background. And one of the tools we use is improvisation.","All actors do that. Should do that and do that. For the most part. I say all actors. I'm exaggerating, but you know who does and who doesn't. Vince is a wonderful young actor who knows his work and did a beautiful job on this film.","Everything is difficult, and everything worthwhile is difficult. A certain need, a need not unlike Mickey had: to know, to understand, and I had that need to understand and to know.","Hardly any actor objects to press. It's a question of it being done in the way they like to see it done, meaning to get down to the serious interview what the profession is so we can reach out to the people to help them get along.","He brought imagination to the story of the Creation.","I grew up with a lot of guys, some of them are dead, some of them are this and some of them that, and some of them very, very powerful, bright young men, who became this instead of that simply because of a lack of guidance - that's all.","I mean, you work and you try and find the work that suits you the best and you enjoy the most.","I thought Jack's directing job was the best thing about the film.","I was out to have a good time and have some fun. It's a fun script and fun people are in the movie.","It's a very, very fascinating story for me, cause it's about a man who's been doing bad; bad things. And he's a father of four children in parochial school, he's a lieutenant of detectives, but he's in conflict with himself and with trying to do what's right.","She had said one time, make a choice and do it like Hercules. So if that is all of what is being offered, the idea is to always do it like Hercules and I always followed her advise and now I'm here talking to you.","So there's no such thing as one too many this, one too many that. I remember, you're reminding me of early in my career, somebody said to me: why are you taking so many roles as a policeman.","That's like asking a cobbler if he's made too many pairs of shoes.","Then I heard this genius teacher Stella Adler - I recommend you read anything you might find about her and if you have anyone interested in theatre, you get them one of her books.","They have equal weight and you do the same work you'd do if you were playing a dramatic role.","Uhm, I'm the one wanting the lessons! I don't want to say too much about it because I'd rather have you see the movie, but he's trying to find his music.","Well unfortunately I didn't work with Andre much. But rap is a strong presence in the culture and anyone is going to grateful for its appearance, grateful for any kind of music that has the kind of effect that rap has had on us all.","Well, you sort of get out of the pool room, you get out of the Marine Corps, you get out and read some literature, you become involved with people who also want to know and are ready to share some ideas about literature and thoughts, and it becomes nourished that way.","What fascinated me mostly about Mickey Cohen was that he, in his later years, hired someone to help him to comprehend literature, to help him to read better, to understand words better.","You didn't hear the angels singing. It was brought down to Mother Earth, which is where it should be. And that led me to a lot of other reading.","You're working on being a father, so that is something that when you experience it you'll understand the profundity of wanting to protect something dear to you."],"Harvey Korman":["You have to have a certain persona to be a star, you know, and I don't have that. I'm a banana.","You asked what is the secret of a really good sketch. And it is a sketch is a small play. It's got a beginning, and a middle and an end. It should have a plot; it should have the characters, conflict. It is a little play. And in it, will be funny stuff.","Funny is when you're serious.","They say it's good but I didn't know what I was doing until I got into the suit and they put the moustache on me, and somehow, when I got all the drag on, it came out. It was the most amazing thing. I'm truly extraordinary.","And it's tough traveling. You know, the hotels and the airports and all that. That part, eating and getting around to the hotel room and then going on.","Then I got out of the service, and I was going to be a Shakespearean actor.","I'm not a star.","I wish there was something that - I get all those wonderful letters and wonderful acknowledgments, and I wish I could be more appreciative of what I do. But it's hard for me.","I went to the Goodman School of Drama in Chicago.","I played Hamlet, I played Chekhov and Ibsen and all the classics.","I mean, we had on our show, we had marriages, divorces and other stuff going on. And that was just me.","I got canceled in the middle of making the pilot.","But there's a lot of 50's and a lot of boomers and a lot of kids in their 30's that grew up with us.","And I went to New York and died; for 10 years I walked those pavements. I can't think of New York without feeling uncomfortable and feeling like a failure.","Although in Abbott and Costello, and straight man was first. That's a very interesting concept."],"Harvey Mackay":["A great accomplishment shouldn't be the end of the road, just the starting point for the next leap forward.","None of us got to where we are alone. Whether the assistance we received was obvious or subtle, acknowledging someone's help is a big part of understanding the importance of saying thank you.","Talent is God-given; be humble. Fame is man-given; be thankful. Conceit is self-given; be careful.","When you wake up every day, you have two choices. You can either be positive or negative; an optimist or a pessimist. I choose to be an optimist. It's all a matter of perspective.","Employee loyalty begins with employer loyalty. Your employees should know that if they do the job they were hired to do with a reasonable amount of competence and efficiency, you will support them.","Positive thinking is more than just a tagline. It changes the way we behave. And I firmly believe that when I am positive, it not only makes me better, but it also makes those around me better.","It doesn't matter whether you are pursuing success in business, sports, the arts, or life in general: The bridge between wishing and accomplishing is discipline.","Your workforce is your most valuable asset. The knowledge and skills they have represent the fuel that drives the engine of business - and you can leverage that knowledge.","As you schedule individual tasks, give yourself a cushion. Mark the due date a few days ahead of the actual deadline so you have time to deal with changes or last-minute emergencies.","A smart manager will establish a culture of gratitude. Expand the appreciative attitude to suppliers, vendors, delivery people, and of course, customers.","My Golden Rule of Networking is simple: Don't keep score.","Most fears of rejection rest on the desire for approval from other people. Don't base your self-esteem on their opinions.","Deadlines aren't bad. They help you organize your time. They help you set priorities. They make you get going when you might not feel like it.","Life isn't fair. It's true, and you still have to deal with it. Whining about it rarely levels the playing field, but learning to rise above it is the ultimate reward.","Humility is becoming a lost art, but it's not difficult to practice. It means that you realize that others have been involved in your success.","Ethical decisions ensure that everyone's best interests are protected. When in doubt, don't.","I believe that visualization is one of the most powerful means of achieving personal goals.","You can't buy a good reputation; you must earn it.","Southwest Airlines is successful because the company understands it's a customer service company. It also happens to be an airline.","Pay attention to those employees who respectfully ask why. They are demonstrating an interest in their jobs and exhibiting a curiosity that could eventually translate into leadership ability.","An optimist understands that life can be a bumpy road, but at least it is leading somewhere. They learn from mistakes and failures, and are not afraid to fail again.","To be a champion, you have to learn to handle stress and pressure. But if you've prepared mentally and physically, you don't have to worry.","A student of life considers the world a classroom.","To me, job titles don't matter. Everyone is in sales. It's the only way we stay in business.","If you have integrity, nothing else matters. If you don't have integrity, nothing else matters.","By my count, more business leaders have failed and derailed because of arrogance than any other character flaw.","Good intentions aren't enough. People have good intentions when they set a goal to do something, but then they miss a deadline or other milestone.","Just because an employee does things differently doesn't mean he or she won't do the job right or as well. If you establish expectations of the goal and the standards to follow, then methodology shouldn't be an issue.","Worrying about the past or the future isn't productive. When you start chastising yourself for past mistakes, or seeing disaster around every corner, stop and take a breath and ask yourself what you can do right now to succeed.","Learn from the past, but don't live there. Build on what you know so that you don't repeat mistakes. Resolve to learn something new every day. Because every 24 hours, you have the opportunity to have the best day of your company's life.","If you find yourself plagued by a recurrent worry, train yourself to think of something else. Your conscious mind can concentrate on only one thought at a time, and driving the negativity away will free you up to move forward again.","Too often, sales reps simply regurgitate their presentations and expect to land the sale. It doesn't work.","Expect to make some mistakes when you try new and different approaches. Sometimes colossal failures lead to spectacular successes.","Every morning brings new potential, but if you dwell on the misfortunes of the day before, you tend to overlook tremendous opportunities.","The employees who share innovative ideas may also be the folks who have some hidden talents that would help incorporate their suggestions.","When you have a dream that you can't let go of, trust your instincts and pursue it. But remember: Real dreams take work, They take patience, and sometimes they require you to dig down very deep. Be sure you're willing to do that.","The sooner you accept the fact that you will have both successes and failures, the easier it will be to get your business and personal life headed in the right direction.","You do not get what you want. You get what you negotiate.","It's nice to be important, but more important to be nice. You don't know who your top customers will be five years from now or where you will be in 10 years. You may have a fancy title, but you will always need help from the people around you.","Direct your energy toward achieving a goal, and tackle the problems with an emphasis on edging closer to a successful result.","Amateurs wait for inspiration. The real pros get up and go to work.","The cost of praising someone is nil - but every psychological study shows the payoff is huge.","The quality of your life is determined by the quality of your relationships. The quality of your business is no different.","If you believe, as I do, that your employees truly are your most valuable asset, you will do whatever you can to help them do their jobs as well as possible.","You learn how to be book smart in school, but you better not forget that you also need to be street smart.","Remember you're not entitled to anything. You have to earn your success every day, and you will make mistakes like everyone else.","Fatigue makes fools of us all. It robs you of your skills and your judgment, and it blinds you to creative solutions. It's the best-conditioned athlete, not the most talented, who generally wins when the going gets tough.","If you want people to know how much you care, show them how much you remember. Learn their names and use them often. It's an important skill to develop.","You can win more friends with your ears than with your mouth. People who feel like they're being listened to feel accepted and appreciated. They feel like they're being taken seriously and what they say really matters.","I've learned that people will seldom let you down if they understand that your destiny is in their hands, and vice versa.","Delegating doesn't mean passing off work you don't enjoy, but letting your employees stretch their skills and judgment.","Exploring how you could make a bad situation worse can sometimes tell you what not to do.","Give your subconscious a chance to work by turning your brain off from time to time. Don't focus on work or solving problems constantly.","Pale ink is better than the most retentive memory.","In a litigation-happy society, clear agreements often prevent small disagreements from becoming big ones.","By getting your customers to agree with you in small steps along the way, you have a better chance of reaching agreement when it's time to do business.","You don't need a big close, as many sales reps believe. You risk losing your customer when you save all the good stuff for the end. Keep the customer actively involved throughout your presentation, and watch your results improve.","No business can stay in business without customers. How you treat - or mistreat - them determines how long your doors stay open.","The service leaders hire one out of 50 applicants, sometimes one out of 100, but they're very, very careful. You can't afford not to be extremely choosy when you hire.","I have ten marathons under my belt, including four New York races and one Boston.","I've known entrepreneurs who were not great salespeople, or didn't know how to code, or were not particularly charismatic leaders. But I don't know of any entrepreneurs who have achieved any level of success without persistence and determination.","When an employee asks why the company does things a certain way, and you can explain the logical reason, then the employee knows what she's doing is valid.","Ego stops you from getting things done and getting people to work with you. That's why I firmly believe that ego and success are not compatible.","There is no shame in taking pride in achievements or position. But nobody gets to the top alone.","It's only lonely at the top if you forget all the people you met along the way and fail to acknowledge their contributions to your success.","There is a time to provide advice and offer an opinion, and there is a time not to. Don't be too quick to offer unsolicited advice. It certainly will not endear you to people.","Never forget, the real secret of giving advice is this: Once you've given it, don't concern yourself with whether it is followed or not, and refrain from saying 'I told you so.'","When advice is freely given, the receiver is free to use it as he or she sees fit.","The life of a startup is full of ups and downs, an emotional roller coaster ride that you can't quite imagine if you've spent your whole career in a corporation.","Like it or not, life is a series of competitions. You may be competing for a grade, a spot on a team, a job, or the largest account in town. The higher your self-esteem is, the better you get along with yourself, with others, and the more you'll accomplish.","Customers are the reason we open our doors every day, and keep the machines humming all night long. Customers determine what we eat, where we live, whether we stay in business.","In a climate of tight budgets, reduced workforces and stiff competition, internal training can be a great substitute for costly offsite workshops and conferences.","Pessimism doesn't grow your business or even maintain the status quo. The pessimists on your staff make the job harder for everyone around them. They make difficulties out of opportunities.","The annals of business are filled with stories of companies that thought they had it made and could milk their enterprises without having to bother about improving their products or services. It's amazing how fast they found their markets disappearing.","Don't fall in love with your wit. Your cleverly turned phrase may not, as you hope, show off how much gray matter you have, especially if the phrase is at someone else's expense.","No one ever wants to see his or her name linked to anything bad. Conscience is like a baby. It has to go to sleep before you can."],"Harvey Martin":["I had such a wonderful life before drugs and alcohol abuse. I've got that life back now and plan to keep it. Maybe I had to go through what I did to get to this point, to appreciate this life more.","I need to go where I feel loved.","I'm not mean, just aggressive.","I killed many a quarterback. I felt like I scored when I took their head off.","You stand still, somebody might get close to you. I don't stand still much anymore.","I love this acting stuff.","Acting like the person I'm supposed to be has always been the easiest thing for me."],"Harvey Mason, Jr.":["I worked every day - Christmas Eve, birthdays - trying to become a great basketball player. Everywhere I went, I had a basketball.","I like creating something from nothing and hearing it on the radio or on stage or from somebody driving down the street singing it. It's like building a house, taking a vacant piece of land, and next thing you know, there's a house with somebody living in it.","A vocal producer is very important, and it's a very important component of an overall successful and good-sounding record.","I think I went more toward writing because that's my talent. I don't think I was a great performer... And I like being behind the scenes a little bit.","I came to L.A. in 1970, and my desire and my training was to be a studio musician, which I had read about in my senior year in high school.","I've played with so many people that I never really noticed that I was playing with so many people until after it was compiled on the Internet. I just kept going. I haven't even heard half the records I've played on, to tell you the truth.","It's so wide; that's what I love most about my career. It's been varied, and the music has been varied, because I find myself getting bored pretty easily. So for me, to work in the studio has been great. I didn't go on the road; I just worked on a different project every day, a different kind of music, and that's the challenge I love.","I give my heart in every single session I've done, and I get into the music. I love all kinds of music, and I try and really be as authentic as possible and give from my heart.","Part of doing mash-ups is getting the legal rights to use the songs. If you're going to do a mash-up with five songs, you should probably find 10 songs, because you're only going to get half of them cleared. It's a real collaborative effort.","With new artists, you really don't have anything to reference. You're helping to develop their sound, define who they are vocally.","The more people who come from musical backgrounds and go into promotion, production, songwriting, A&R, plus get their business head together, the better. They'll not only understand the business aspect, they'll also have a true passion and ear for how quality is represented musically.","When we do R&B midtempos or ballads, there's an Underdogs sound."],"Harvey Milk":["It takes no compromising to give people their rights. It takes no money to respect the individual. It takes no survey to remove repressions.","Hope will never be silent.","If a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet door.","I have tasted freedom. I will not give up that which I have tasted.","Burst down those closet doors once and for all, and stand up and start to fight.","If every gay person were to come out only to his/her own family, friends, neighbors and fellow workers, within days the entire state would discover that we are not the stereotypes generally assumed.","Once you have dialogue starting, you know you can break down prejudice.","Give me your support, and I'll fight for you... I'll fight for you because I am you.","If we wish to rebuild our cities, we must first rebuild our neighborhoods. And to do that, we must understand that the quality of life is more important than the standard of living.","You must come out. Come out... to your parents... I know that it is hard and will hurt them, but think about how they will hurt you in the voting booth!","All over the country, they're reading about me, and the story doesn't center on me being gay. It's just about a gay person who is doing his job.","Coming out is the most political thing you can do.","I personally will never forget that people are more important than buildings.","I stand for all those who feel that the government no longer understands the individual and no longer respects individual rights.","The first gay people we elect must be strong. They must not be content to sit in the back of the bus. They must not be content to accept pablum. They must be above wheeling and dealing.","A gay person in office can set a tone, can command respect not only from the larger community but from the young people in our own community who need both examples and hope.","If you help elect more gay people, that gives a green light to all who feel disenfranchised, a green light to move forward. It means hope to a nation that has given up, because if a gay person makes it, the doors are open to everyone.","If I do a good job, people won't care if I am green or have three heads.","I will never forget what it was like coming out and having nobody to look up toward.","My name is Harvey Milk and I'm here to recruit you.","Never take an elevator in city hall.","The fact is that more people have been slaughtered in the name of religion than for any other single reason. That, that my friends, is true perversion.","More people have been slaughtered in the name of religion than for any other single reason. That, my friends, that is true perversion.","Having a small business and being one of thousands of people whom no one in government will listen to, I have decided to run for supervisor as a person.","I'm a small businessman and I'm well aware of the uncertainties of the economy, exactly what the 'inflationary spiral' means when I'm forced to raise prices to my customers, and how taxes can eat into your earnings."],"Harvey Pekar":["I was influenced by autobiographical writers like Henry Miller, and I had actually done some autobiographical prose. But I just thought that comics were like virgin territory. There was so much to be done. It excited me. I couldn't draw very well. I could write scripts and storyboard style using stick figures and balloons and captions.","I guess I wanted to show people, among other things, that you don't have to be a hero to get through cancer. You can be a craven coward and get through. You have to stay on your medication and take your treatments, that's all.","I'm kind of concerned about 'Ego & Hubris' because I'm thinking that people will read it and maybe even be entertained by it, but at the end of it, you know, they'll wonder, 'Why did this guy write this? What was the point of it?'","I came up with American Splendor. Some people think it's American Squalor.","Misery loves company. There's a lot to that.","You can find heroism everyday, like guys working terrible jobs because they've got to support their families. Or as far as humor, the things I see on the job, on the street, are far funnier than anything you'll ever see on TV.","When I was a kid, back in the '40s, I was a voracious comic book reader. And at that time, there was a lot of patriotism in the comics. They were called things like 'All-American Comics' or 'Star-Spangled Comics' or things like that. I decided to do a logo that was a parody of those comics, with 'American' as the first word.","American Splendor is just an ongoing journal. It's an ongoing autobiography. I started it when I was in my early 30s, and I just keep going.","Everybody's like everybody else, and everybody's different from everybody else.","I continue to be disappointed that people don't try and diversify the kind of work they are doing in comics.","I decided I was going to tell these stories. I went around and met Crumb. He was the cartoonist. I started realizing comics weren't just kid stuff.","I don't write about certain arguments I have with my wife. I'd get my head torn off if wrote about certain things.","I met Robert Crumb in 1962; he lived in Cleveland for a while. I took a look at his stuff. Crumb was doing stuff beyond what other writers and artists were doing. It was a step beyond Mad.","I really don't have a lot in common with the people who attend the Comic Con. It's like assuming that all people who write prose are the same.","I think comics have far more potential than a lot of people realize.","I think the people who would be the least interested in my work would be people who read lots of comic books.","I think you can do anything with comics that you could do in just about any art form.","I thought I had a great opportunity when I started doing my comic book in 1972. I thought there was so much territory to work in.","I try and write the way things happen. I don't try and fulfill people's wishes.","I write scripts in storyboard fashion using stick figures, and thought balloons and word balloons and captions. Then I'll write descriptions of what scenes should look like and turn it over to the artist.","I'd been familiar with comics, and I'd collected 'em when I was a kid, but after I got into junior high school, there wasn't much I was interested in.","I'm a guy that likes to sit in one place.","I'm doing research for a large comic book on the Beat Generation guys - Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac and those guys.","I've probably had my day in the sun. I think I've influenced a lot of comic book writers.","It didn't take long to establish myself, as far as people thinking my work was good. They liked it from the start.","It makes you feel good to know that there's other people afflicted like you.","It seemed to me you could do anything in comics. So I started doing my thing, which is mainly influenced by novelists, stand-up comedians, that sort of thing.","It's extremely seldom that anybody wants me to change what I've written about them. Generally I portray them in a good light, if they're friends.","Letterman... he got his problems. We don't get along too well.","My work looks like a comic book in form, but it's not a typical comic book in content. I write autobiographical stuff.","People who are readers of fiction aren't particularly interested in comic books.","People writing about me have said that I've influenced a lot of people, and there are some artists who have credited me with influencing them.","Plays have been made of my comics.","The film's success so far involves winning a couple of prizes at Cannes and Sundance, and getting some very nice reviews in newspapers and magazines. That hasn't had a big impact on my life yet.","There hasn't been enough change in comics to suit me. I don't know why exactly.","Things improved a little bit in the '80s; there was kind of a revival of alternative comics, but then they went downhill in the '90s.","I'm always shook up and nervous and I've got the hospital record to prove it.","I wake up every morning in a cold sweat, regardless of how well things went the day before. And put that I said that in a somewhat but not completely tongue-in-cheek way.","As a matter of fact, I deliberately look for the mundane, because I feel these stories are ignored. The most influential things that happen to virtually all of us are the things that happen on a daily basis. Not the traumas.","I think you can find all the elements that you can find in great literature in mundane experiences.","I like to go back over history and check out what people have written and whether I agree with it or not.","Some of the most valuable stuff I do has to do with my dissenting from the general opinion about people in movements.","I don't mind if I show myself being cheap or unreasonable sometimes.","I'm trying to get every man involved in art, into experimental music, or painting, or novel-writing.","Cleveland has a very bad reputation, but there's a lot of stuff that's left over from when there were very wealthy people - the Art Museum and a world class symphony that's still world class.","I always wanted praise, and I always wanted attention; I won't lie to you. I was a jazz critic, and that wasn't good enough for me. I wanted people to write about me, not me about them. So I thought, 'What could I do? I can't sing, I can't dance, I can't act or anything like that. OK, I can write.'","The way I write is, I listen to things in my head, and then I copy them down. I memorize conversations and things like that; I seem to be able to do that pretty well. I suppose in that respect there's some improvisation, although I work over the stuff after I've got it down on paper.","I have to be a freelance writer for the rest of my life, unless I get some kind of real lucky break. But other than that, I'll always have to work. I always worry about whether my stuff is going to get over. Will they like this, will they like that?","I was 16 years old, and I was just flailing around, looking for an interest. I heard, you know, these jazz records. They were modern records, at the time in the '50s, and I realized that I didn't fully get what was going on. But I liked a lot of what I heard.","I kept on buying records and listening to them. Finally, I was able to hear the relationship between the jazz improvisers' solos and the underlying structure that it's based on, the chord progression. That was pretty easy to do in the swing era, y'know, when jazz was, like, pop music, you know. It had made the charts and everything like that.","It's real easy for me to write a lot of stories. I just go and I live through something, and I go home and write about it. It's that quick.","I'd like to see the comics' style expanded. I'd like to see artists synthesize traditional comics arts style with fine-arts styles or whatever. I like to see innovation. I don't like it when an art form becomes stagnant.","A respectable-sized audience hasn't really been able to follow developments in jazz since the free jazz movement in the '60s. Some of them can't even get with John Coltrane. Audiences are diminishing more and more rapidly. Some of the top young musicians with something new to say can't get record companies to put out their stuff.","I was sort of on a mission with 'American Splendor.' I wanted to try to prove that comics could do things. I wanted to expand them beyond superheroes and talking animals. And I knew that was going to take a long time. But I just started writing an autobiography about my quotidian life.","I'm pretty aggressive, and maybe obnoxious, about trying to get work.","I'm from the beatnik generation, where everybody wanted to be a poet or writer or something. And at that time, I was a jazz critic, and I was always thinking, theorizing about what makes great art or what's important in art.","There's no limitation on comics, nothing. From a logical standpoint, how can there be a limitation on comics? You can use any word in the dictionary. You can put them in any order you want to. You can use a vast variety of illustrating styles. People could do all sorts of things.","I worry about getting work, and then when I get it, I worry about doing it well. I don't want to just go through the motions and give people stuff. This stuff is really important to me.","I want to keep doing as much work as I can, and I want to keep the level high. I'm wondering if something is going to happen to me to screw it up.","Of course I don't think I have it made by any means. I'm too insecure, obsessive and paranoid for that.","It dawned on me that comics were not an intrinsically limited medium. There was a tremendous amount of things you could do in comics that you couldn't do in other art forms - but no one was doing it. I figured if I'd make a try at it, I'd at least be a footnote in history.","Even a pretty traditional comic book writer can make valuable contributions to the Internet.","I've just been writing stuff down as it comes to me. I haven't thought, 'Let me write some major opus here.'","Sometimes I want to convey something complex philosophically, and sometimes I just want to portray myself in a situation that I think other people have been in many times, but it hasn't been written about much.","I don't want to play myself up as a hero, because it would make me unbelievable. I'd rather settle for people thinking that I'm a bum, but digging my stories, than liking me and not being able to believe in my stories. That's one reason I've been hard on myself, because I want my stuff to be believable.","I've gotten more and more cut off from the regular comic-book world, from straight comics and stuff like that. Once in a while, I'll take a look at something.","I can't write in a whole lot of different styles, trying to please the highbrows one time and the lowbrows the next. I pretty much have a basic style I employ.","I concentrate, more than I think virtually any comic book artist has in the past, on the so-called mundane details of every day life - quotidian life. What happens to a person during a working day, marital relations, and stuff like that.","If there is something to worry about, my mind has a tendency to worry about it. That can cut two ways. It can really keep you on the ball, but if you worry about every little thing, it's not a good use of time and energy.","I'm just tired of people saying I'm a self-hating Jew because I'm critical of Israel or make fun of old Jewish ladies. I do not hate myself. And Jews who criticize Israel aren't necessarily mentally ill.","Israel's creation was politically amazing and caused by a number of unusual events. And I understand. For centuries, Jews endured horrible suffering, and like other people, deserve the right to self-determination, but the way Israel is going now frightens me. Jews make awkward colonial overlords.","I write about my life, choosing incidents that I think will be, for one reason or another, significant to people. Often because they may have experienced the same things."],"Harvey Penick":["Go out and have fun. Golf is a game for everyone, not just for the talented few.","Golf has probably kept more people sane than psychiatrists have.","I don't care how good you play, you can find somebody who can beat you, and I don't care how bad you play, you can find somebody you can beat.","Be brave if you lose and meek if you win."],"Harvey S.

Experience isn't that important. You can get both of these things. What is important is ideas.","If you have ideas, you have the main asset you need, and there isn't any limit to what you can do with your business and your life. Ideas are any man's greatest asset.","I can walk through the front door of any factory and out the back and tell you if it's making money or not. I can just tell by the way it's being run and by the spirit of the workers.","Thought, not money, is the real business capital.","The secret of my success is a two word answer: Know people."],"Harvey V. Fineberg":["We've gone from a preponderance of acute and infectious disease as a source of premature death to chronic diseases, which are the preponderance of the burden of illness in most of the world. That puts a much higher premium on the prevention of chronic disease than ever in history.","The flu is very unpredictable when it begins and in how it takes off.","Evolution does not necessarily favor the longest-lived. It doesn't necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest, and not even the smartest. Evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment. That is the sole test of survival and success.","Autism is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by social withdrawal, by repetitive behaviors and by some kind of focal attention in its classic form. Basically, it's an inability to relate to others.","The emergency care Americans receive can fall short of what they expect and deserve.","Nature is the worst terrorist you can imagine.","When you're dealing with a problem as complex as autism, you have to look at it from many different points of view and assemble evidence from many different vantage points. Biological evidence in humans and in animals, toxicologic evidence, how does the body deal with toxins, and evidence looking at the actual experience in populations.","Keep in mind that there are many neurotoxins in the world. Dozens of natural and industrial substances have neurotoxic properties.","Autism is a complicated illness, and children with a variety of treatments and non-treatments show improvement over time, which is all to the good.","We don't have spittoons on street corners any more. It's no longer acceptable to spit on the street.","When cultural change succeeds, it succeeds because it's so embedded in what we do that we don't have to think about.","I spend so much of my day at work. I would like to have the workplace be part of a healthier strategy. Reminding me more about walking the steps rather than taking that elevator. Not just promoting healthier food in the cafeteria, but providing information on healthier choices. I use it when I look at the alternatives.","Evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation, adapting and surviving through generation after generation. From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like the booster rockets designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea.","At the bottom of the ocean, bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce, if fish were there, sous-vide cooked fish, nevertheless, have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them."],"Hasan M. Elahi":["Big Brother doesn't like all these Little Brothers looking at it.","The concept of surveillance is ingrained in our beings. God was the original surveillance camera.","How do you manage your online identity? It's something I talk about with my students all the time.","We're all creating an archive of our own lives, whether we're aware of it or not.","You hear these horrible stories about the FBI just doing all these nasty things to people. And you know what? In my case, I didn't experience any of that, probably because the way I treated them. I was like, 'Okay, what do you want to know?' So I kept going back to their offices on a regular basis.","If 300 million people were to offer up the details of their private lives, you would need to hire another 300 million people just to keep up.","I've pretty much accepted the fact that you're going to meet ignorant people, and that's okay. You can't control that. You can't change that.","It's incredibly disturbing when a country, particularly your own country, uses discrimination as a basis for an investigation.","We don't know what the next generation of art is going to look like. We're kind of making it up as we go along. Not unlike the tech industry.","To this day, I get very nervous coming back into my own country.","I'm convinced that if we don't define ourselves, other people will do it for us, and inaccurately.","Despite the barrage of information about me that is publicly available, I live a surprisingly private and anonymous life.","It's really weird watching the government watch me.","You can accuse me of being a terror suspect, but I can prove to you that I'm not.","I'm an artist.

Restricted access to information is what makes it valuable."],"Hasan Minhaj":["My dad's from that generation like a lot of immigrants where he feels like if you come to this country, you pay this thing like the American dream tax: like you're going to endure some racism, and if it doesn't cost you your life, well hey, you lucked out. Pay it; there you go, Uncle Sam. I was born here, so I actually had the audacity of equality.","One thing I found very interesting about comedians around the world was their knowledge of stuff outside of their own culture and comfort zone. That's not very common in the States. We produce our own soft power, which is pop culture, but we rarely try to absorb and learn information from other cultures and countries.","Donald Trump does not touch alcohol, which is really respectable. But think about that. That means every statement, every interview, every tweet - completely sober.","I wanted to be Atticus Finch.","If you want a great replacement, like, who can follow Barack and still have that swag, that charisma, that charm and be historic - I think it would be Tina Fey for president.","I feel like we have so much to add to this book called the American Dream, and I want to add our chapter to it. I want to talk about what it means to be brown American and this concept of what I feel is the New Brown America.","I've learned to start from a really sound argument, boil down the essence of what you're trying to say, then build your humor around that, rather than starting with, 'This sounds funny,' and going from there.","A lot of people in the media say that Donald Trump goes golfing too much, which raises a very important question: Why do you care? Do you want to know what he's not doing when he's golfing? Being president. Let the man putt-putt!","As a Muslim, I like to watch Fox News for the same reason I like to play 'Call of Duty.' Sometimes, I like to turn my brain off and watch strangers insult my family and heritage.","I love air conditioning and Starbucks.","There's all sorts of terrible things that happen around the world. And comedy's one of those few things where you can discuss those things.","Free speech is the foundation of an open and liberal democracy from college campuses to the White House.","I'd rather be an angry optimist than an angry nihilist.","Donald Trump doesn't care about free speech. The man who tweets everything that enters his head doesn't care about the amendment which lets him do that.","Donald Trump is not a 71-year-old white man. He is an Indian uncle. He wears suits that don't fit; he can't speak English properly. He works with his idiotic sons; he hates women but loves his daughter. He makes up words when he gets angry. He is an Indian uncle.","When you immerse yourself in a community, you tend to rise in that community.","New Brown America represents a whole generation of kids that are descendants of either immigrants or immigrants themselves, that are coming to America, enriching what it means to be an American.","A lot of times, especially when it comes to political debates, people get caught up in esoteric statistics. So the realest thing I can do that has nothing to do with numbers is tell you my personal experience.","Sean Spicer has somehow been doing PR since 1999, which is 18 years. Somehow, after 18 years, his go-to move was denying the Holocaust.","If it's just me on stage telling stories for, like, an hour, that's great. That's fine. But like a sandcastle on the beach, it gets washed away at night. It's so much more powerful if we can all share our narratives and doorstep moments and make us feel a little less alone. I'm just trying to use social media and new media as a way to capture that.","I like to have straight-up black coffee, but when you get it, sometimes you'll burn your tongue, or it spills on your hands, and you get third degree burns. I happen to be the kind of human being who doesn't want to sue coffee companies for money, so I just say, 'Hey, can you give me some coffee, but can you also give me like, eight ice cubes.'","To show that a comedian on stage in India talking about sanitation or in South Africa talking about HIV and AIDS awareness, if you follow the joke into their lives, you can see that, like, oh, these things aren't just contrived in joke books. This is real life. I think the best comedians have that bravery and courage to say, Oh, this is what it is.","I've found the 90-10 rule to be pretty true: 90 percent of what I come up with and write down is kinda 'eh,' and then somehow, someway, 10 percent of it happens to work out really great in my act.","The movies 'Dope' and 'Straight Outta Compton' blew me away. I love seeing directors and writers of color make amazing slices of pop culture.","I'm addicted to chocolate chip cookies. I mean that seriously. If there are chocolate chip cookies, I will devour them.","Sean Spicer gives press briefings like someone is going through his browser history while he watches.","'CNN Tonight' should just be called 'Wait a second! Now hold on! Stop yelling at each!' with Don Lemon.","Being healthy is the crown that only the sick can see. A lot of times, we take it for granted.","I feel like every conversation with my father is like an M. Night Shyamalan movie; 90 minutes of build-up to no payoff.","Donald Trump is white ISIS - WISIS.","One of the biggest things immigrant kids oftentimes feel is this big disparity between our parents and us. And our parents are staunch pragmatists, and I consider myself to be an optimist.","The day-to-day microaggressions that we all face, yeah, you have to let some stuff slide, or you go, 'I gotta keep moving; there's bigger fish to fry.' It's something that I still deal with. But I've tried to have the audacity of equality and to follow my heart in those moments where I feel like something is wrong.","I was actually a really sort of nervous, shy kid. In high school, it was one of those things where I wasn't popular or a loser; I just don't think many people really knew who I was.","Racism has a very quick expiration date when exposed to actual contact with people.","I call my style Classic Americana Swag. I do my vibe, and I'll throw in a cool sneaker here or there, a pair of Js.","My dad was the only son from his entire family to come to America, and I was his only son. We had come to the States to achieve security and success for our family. Rules were simple: No fun, no friends, no girls. Go to school, come home, and study.","My biggest inspiration is black America and what they've done in the arts. I have always felt like an outsider in America, and what black Americans have done to add their chapter to this book called the American dream, and to be so unapologetic and true, and have added so much to art and culture in the world.","Jokes for jokes' sake are kind of meaningless to me. I understand the value of them, but it doesn't speak to me as much. You can lace your argument with jokes, but tell me why you're presenting this argument. What does it mean?","The traditional Hollywood system is pretty rigid, but the film scene in, say, South Africa is booming with a lot of possibilities. If you have the cameras and reasonable capital, you can put your film in theatres next to 'Guardians of the Galaxy.' A great example of that was Kagiso Lediga's film 'Blitz Patrole.'","I had a huge Indian wedding, and I did it for my wife, and I did it for my white friends.","Growing up in the States, there's this part of me that's like, man, I'm Indian. Like, this is where I belong. And as soon as I got to India, and I had to go to the bathroom in some places, I was, like, 'Man - I am American.'","Aditi is a comedy superstar over in India. She's only one of three female English-speaking comedians in India.","'Shantaram' is fantastic. An Australian prisoner escapes & joins the mafia in India? Sign me up. I love stuff that is based on true stories.","J. Cole's 2014 'Forrest Hills Drive.' The album, artwork, and director of that album was a huge influence on the visuals for 'Homecoming King.'","I'm not a Larry David. I don't have a 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' and a 'Seinfeld' in me.","I can't emphasize how important free speech is to a liberal and free democracy.","Donald Trump is liar-in-chief.","U.S.A. Today is what happens when the coupon section takes over the newspaper.","Only in America can the first-generation Indian American Muslim kid get on the stage and make fun of the president.","Every time Trump goes golfing, the headline should read, 'Trump Goes Golfing. Apocalypse Delayed.'","Everything isn't breaking news. You can't go to DEFCON One just because Sanjay Gupta found a new moisturizer.","Every time I watch CNN, it feels like you're assigning me homework. Is Trump a Russian spy? I don't know. You tell me - I'm watching the news. It feels like I'm watching CNN watch the news. Just take an hour, figure out what you want to say, then go on the air.","Every time a U.S.A. Today slides underneath my door, it's like they're saying, 'Hey, you're not that smart, right?'","It is 2017, and we are living in the golden age of lying.","I look like a melanin version of Chris Hayes.","Even the president is not beyond the reach of the First Amendment.","People still assume the White House Correspondents' Association works for the White House, when in reality, it's a group of journalists who cover the White House. It's a branding thing, but because it has the 'White House' before it, people think they're just King Joffrey's goons.","The news is best when it's serious.","Political culture has become popular culture.","Whoever has the best take is what matters. My challenge is finding the best take, and it'll always be that.","My mom worked at the VA for years, so any time I can do anything to help, it's a must.","Dick Gregory and Richard Pryor laid the groundwork for us as Indian-Americans. How can we add our story to their groundwork is the question.","I'm a big believer in doing everything you can and everything in your power to change the outcome. But health is one of those things you can't control, and it's a very scary thing for me.","I'm a huge fan of Beverly Cleary.","You can hear my opinion on various subjects, but telling my story is the most authentic thing I can do. There's nothing more powerful I can share with an audience.","Funny and sad are two sides of the same coin. I think that most comedians are able to tap into deep subject matter.","I think the best comedians have that bravery and courage to say, 'This is what it is. This is unfair; that's not cool.'","I think the way comedy is represented on screen is it's either all fart jokes - and it's just laughter for the sake of laughter - or it's one of those things where it's just kind of very preachy, very heavy-handed.","'Stand-Up Planet' was Anthony Bourdain-meets-stand-up comedy.","Donald Trump is an extremist leader who came out of nowhere. He's self-financed, recruits through social media, attracts his followers with a radical ideology to take over the world, and is actively trying to promote a war between Islam and the West.","Comedy is very disarming. It's a way to talk about things and still be light-hearted. And when it's done really well, you never see the strings, whereas when you watch an infomercial or a politician speaking, a lot of times you can see the strings, you can see what agenda they're trying to push.","If you and I believe two different things, I can attack you verbally all day, but if I can make you laugh and show you the absurdity of your argument, it will lower you guard. People let you in then.","Everybody's past and history informs them.","I'm just an American citizen like everyone else and I'm not sitting at the power table in the room where it all happens.","I'm a first-generation kid in this country. I so identify with America and its culture. I'm a citizen, I was born here. I'm American. At the same time, like most first-generation kids, I have this other identity to another country back home, which is India.","America's unique ability to change and be super flexible is pretty dope, man. It's pretty incredible. And that's what I want to contribute to.","Nuanced debate can't stand up to a guy who's calling women pigs and retweeting white supremacists.","There are definitely some set topics I go onstage with and want to talk about, but there's also an element of improvisation and spontaneity that I like to bring to each performance and talk about uniquely in that room.","When you can tailor your act, you want it to be about yourself but also about the people in the room and the experience you guys are having in that moment; it is really a special thing.","Bananas are my go-to breakfast.","I went to college during the Kazaa/Napster era, and we had free Internet, which was a huge deal. People were just downloading all of everything.","The story that I'm telling in 'Homecoming King' about falling in love, these are things that happened to me - that actually happen every day in our backyards and in our communities.","A lot of times in life, it's personal choices that you're making, actively, and then there's a myriad of forces and circumstances that are out of our control. And without even realizing it, you're riding a wave of events that you have no control of.","On 'The Daily Show,' we get so caught up in the day-to-day news cycle. A story breaks, and then the piranhas in late night, we all jump to the headline, and we dissect it, and then we have to move on to the next day.","I exist in this hyphen. I'm an Indian-American-Muslim kid, but am I more Indian, or am I more American? What part of my identity am I?","In high school, I didn't know what comedy was, but I was involved in speech and debate and public speaking.","My favorite comedians are just presenting an argument, and they're doing it in a funny way.","I was good at speech and debate and academics. I should've stayed in my lane, but I kept trying out for the basketball team. I thought I would make the N.B.A.","I had been cut from the basketball team every year. But I was like, 'I can turn it around! Michael Jordan made it!' You see it a lot of times - you'll have an athlete that you love, and then they'll be like, 'I also want to rap,' and you're like, 'Don't do that.' I was that kid.","What I love about comedy is that we're this group of weirdos, and the only language that matters is, 'Are you funny?' And it really is this oddly cool American idea where comedy's the marketplace of ideas. May the best idea win.","I think perspective is a necessary, amazing thing.","Personal narrative is one of the few things where people don't get caught up in fighting over esoteric rhetoric.","My goal is just to continue to find mediums to tell stories that I think need to be told.","As satirists, we get to stand on the sidelines of life and comment on what's happening.","I just hope that people get a variety of news sources to keep themselves informed.","The 'Homecoming King' show started off as a storytelling show that I had done; I worked with Greg Walloch to develop it and build it into something bigger.","I grew up in a pretty strict household in the sense that we just didn't have cable, so I wasn't familiar with what stand-up comedy was. I remember telling my friends that I thought stand-up comedy was like the thing that happened before the episode of 'Seinfeld.'","My mom works at the VA; she's been working at the VA for 15 plus years, and yet she's helping so many veterans coming back from brown Muslim countries, and my mom treats them. It's this weird - sometimes I feel torn. It's this dual identity. I'm so proud to be American, and at the same time, I disagree with our foreign policy.","I just hope I reach out to people and connect to people in such a way that they continue to support what I do.","We shouldn't get lost in the bombastic tweets of Trump. He provides such great fodder every day. You don't want to lose sight of the other stuff that's going on that's even more important.","When you have friends that are Muslim, Jewish, gay, from any marginalized group, you realize that they are so much more than this esoteric talking point.","When you grow up as a minority in a majority culture, a lot of times, you're just trying to fit in.","I think there are people from every side who are allies for justice and good.","Trump is inadvertently forcing us to show him how great this country truly is - that we are better together than we are divided.","This first-generation narrative keeps happening over and over and over again, whether it was Irish or Jewish or our community, South Asians, Japanese-Americans, Mexican-Americans. We've all gone through this sort of bridge, and it will continue to happen.","'Vice News' is cool because they'll just send your local barista to go talk to the head of ISIS.","I just started the way most comics start, doing open mic shows around Sacramento and San Francisco, and eventually, I moved to L.A. After about four or five years in L.A., I got the call to join the 'The Daily Show.'","I've experienced Islamophobic stuff. But I don't care - you can say whatever you want to say about me, but I am who I am. I think that what I'm trying to fight for and what I'm performing for is bigger than any religion, race, creed, or class.","In California, you can stretch your arms out and not be touching another person. You get space, sun and, in general, dignity.","As a single guy, the baseline of what I needed was so low. I just needed an air mattress, food, and rent money.","Beena and I didn't move in together until we got married."],"Hasil Adkins":["I don't live on a hill. I live down under a hill, in the bottom and I've got a lot of cars, yeah.","I got about 6037 songs I wrote myself and I'm trying to get them on the market and I just wish people could hear them and stuff but they'll do pretty good.","My first record came out in 1961 and then I had one come out in 1962 and then I had two that came out in 1964.","That's when we was makin this video stuff. They went all over the place makin it. And they was wantin to know, at the college, how I got started playin and how do I do everything - you know, all that.","Up to now I've done everything I've wanted to do the way I wanted to do myself."],"Haskell Wexler":["Documentary people have to know that, particularly nowadays, they have to be on a mission. And part of the mission is to - is to be like good journalists: search for the truth, have an open mind, listen to as much as you can of different sides of things.","As a cameraman, I am interested in images and truth. Today, people are conditioned to accept lies if they are commercial lies. What we don't see anymore is ethics.","I don't attack any kind of script or shooting with some philosophy that is discernible even to myself. It might just be art and love: When I got my Academy Award for 'Virginia Woolf' in the middle of the Vietnam War, I said, 'I hope we can use our art for peace and love.'","I think that we should remember that social change can happen when people join together with some strength.","Professional cinema image-taking should integrate, serve, interest, and enhance the story. I judge cinematography not just for a story well told but for what the story is.","I don't believe in publicity before a film is completed. It costs you money and wastes your energy, and you're inflating your balloon before you have a balloon.","I'd say to anyone trying to break into the business, 'Don't just be interested in movies. Be interested in life. Be a person. Be in touch.'","I was a sailor. I was torpedoed, spent two weeks in a lifeboat. I was on the Murmansk run; I worked a 20 mm. machine gun, helped bring down a Stuka, all that kind of stuff. I've got letters from Franklin Roosevelt for things I did then. But those kind of credentials didn't work for you in the Cold War.","Movies are a voyeuristic experience. You have to make the audience feel like they are peeking through a keyhole. I think of myself as the audience. Then I use light, framing, and motion to create a focal point.","I don't think there is a movie that I've been on that I wasn't sure I could direct it better. But certainly also, as a director of photography, I have to serve the movie in whatever way I can as a filmmaker.","We have a responsibility to show the public the kinds of truths that they don't see on the TV news or the Hollywood film.","Employers will work you longer for less money and under questionable safety conditions because it is their duty to prioritize the bottom line. As individuals, we cannot complain. That's why we need a union to speak for us, certainly when our safety, our health, and our very lives are at stake!","The best thing that winning those Academy Awards things are - the best thing of it is that when I say some of my ideas, somebody's going to listen to it, and they'll preface what I say, 'Academy Award winner da-da-da-da-da.'","People say they make movies to show what 'really happens.' But they only show what they choose to show.","See, New York is over the hill. It's swallowed up in its own garbage. And the people - I can't stand the people.","I am a Chicagoan. I feel like I've simply been on vacation for 10 years in Los Angeles. But Chicago is a real place, and L.A. is a motel.","One person has a responsibility not just for himself but for inter-relationships with the existences of others and the world.","When they speak about 'We the people...,' we the people have to have a voice. It can't just be the establishment voice.","I don't know why I developed a social consciousness, but I really think I have a consciousness; I feel connected to everything and everybody in the world.","Making a film - particularly what I think is a good film - is the result of a team of people, and the end result has many, many hands on it.","There's a scene in 'Medium Cool' in which a young man walks by with a sign that says, 'Sanity, please.' If anything summarizes what I was feeling at that time, it is that sign."],"Hasnat Khan":["Generally, I do not talk about people - family or friends. This is how I am.","I always wanted to follow in the footsteps of my maternal grandfather, who was a doctor.","I think Princess Diana enjoyed it here in Pakistan immensely. She had a good time. But she never came to my family home. She came to my home in Lahore instead.","It is very annoying - things have been written by people who didn't know me at all or Princess Diana. They were written by people who never knew me or met me. It did make me angry. I just stopped reading the papers.","Really, I am just a guy who likes his profession and travelling and good food, and that is it. I'm no different from you or anyone else.","I have a Bachelor in medicine, a Bachelor in surgery, and I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons.","Diana and I had a very good relationship with no personal problems. The only problem we did have was with the media, and the only place we could have any real privacy was at Kensington Palace, as they could not get to us there.","Diana introduced me to Princes William and Harry. Diana just wanted her sons to know what was happening in her life.","It's been difficult for me to get my head around Diana's death or talk about it. After she died, things were difficult, very difficult. We all have our own traumas and get on with it. But when it's there in your face year in, year out, it's hard.","Both my parents, grandmother and all close relatives who met Diana liked her very much, and my parents and grandmother never objected to our relationship. They were very much happy for us to make a decision ourselves and made it clear they would support it 100 per cent. We both had their blessing.","There is no way at all that Diana was mentally unstable. There is nothing wrong with expecting your husband to be faithful and being angry when he isn't. Diana had every reason to believe that Charles and Camilla never stopped seeing each other."],"Hassan II of Morocco":["It is not cowardly, quite the contrary, to seek to meet the adversary and know his intentions. However, it is cowardly, shameful and treasonable to lay down arms.","I beg the Most High to allow me the favour of the double reward, but if God only finds me worthy of one reward, I will accept it in all humility."],"Hassan Nasrallah":["So long as there is imperialism in the world, a permanent peace is impossible.","If you are asking for my point of view, I would say that the Palestinians should go back to Palestine.","The real danger to the world's resistance movements is the attempt to distort reality and to place the blame on the resistance groups' actions without allowing them to portray their perspective, thus ignoring the reality of the occupation and the siege, like the situation in occupied Palestine.","Lebanon is caught in a cycle of threats. And it is our duty to be strong and capable of defending our country. But we will not clarify or explain what we do or do not possess.","When I was 10 or 11, my grandmother had a scarf. It was black, but a long one. I used to wrap it around my head and say to them that 'I'm a cleric, you need to pray behind me.'","I believe that Palestine is an occupied land from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River, and this is the right of the entire Palestinian people, this land.","The Palestinian must stop throwing stones, and the Israelis must stop firing rockets. And in the view of the Sharm el-Sheikh summit, rockets are equal to stones.","Hezbollah is not fighting for Syria. Hezbollah is not fighting for Iran. Hezbollah is fighting for Lebanon.","Among them, there were Muslims, Christians, and Jews living together. But then violent organizations came, bringing with them many large groups of people from various parts of the world to Palestine.","I am against any reconciliation with Israel.","On this land, Muslims, Christians and Jews can coexist together, as they have - as they had for the - for hundreds of years in the framework of a democratic state.","When a peace agreement is concluded between the Lebanese government and Israel, we would surely disagree with the Lebanese government about that, but we would not make any turmoil out of it.","Would you allow a people to come from somewhere else and occupy a part of the United States, and set up an independent state, and, after 50 years, you would not be able to stay on this land?","It is unacceptable, it is forbidden, to harm the innocent.","Lebanon is a small country, weak, an army with very humble capabilities.","To talk about liberty and freedom is nice, lovely, but the important thing is to allow people to act in liberty and freedom.","Force is the duty of the state, not Hizbullah.","However, there is no legal and legitimate state called Israel.","However, they did not treat the reasons that led to this condition. I believe that the conditions in the Palestinian territories are alway capable of explosion because the same circumstances are there.","If you want my opinion, I say that this is a state based on occupation, that has usurped the rights of others.","In man - in the history of mankind, this has happened many times, and occupation leaders hang on to the land that they're occupying. People fight to liberate their land. But in the end, the people's will is what achieves victory.","In the end, we are part of this region, and we are affected by its developments. What we may do or not do in the future depends on the nature of what happens here in the region.","Israel remains a foreign body in this large area, and it always proved that it is unable to coexist with this environment, because the, the scope of the massacres that it has committed does not permit it to coexist.","It's not the first time that I speak with American journalists. I've had meetings with many different newspapers and stations, and I've ha - never had a problem with meeting with American journalists.","That is why if Lebanon concludes a peace agreement with Israel and brings that accord to the Parliament our deputies will reject it; Hezbollah refuses any conciliation with Israel in principle.","The ones who were negotiating are now on the front line of this intifada, because they found that the negotiations didn't give them the minimum of their rights.","The problem is we disagree about the origin. Is this occupied land or not?","We did not start a fight with America, and we don't want a war with America. If someone launches an attack, though, we will respond. We will not take rejection or humiliation. We do not want to fight.","What is being talked about now is the probability of the Sharon government launching an attack against Lebanon to eliminate the resistance of Hezbollah by using the American war against Iraq. But, of course, in this case, we will certainly fight with all our strength.","You can look at the West Bank. Cities are like prisons. They can be closed quickly by the Israeli forces, and everything stops in these cities. This is the result of Oslo.","A majority of the Syrian people believe in the regime and support Bashar al-Assad.","The fall of the Syrian regime is in the interest of America and Israel.","There should be resolutions adopted in top international institutions, which are binding on all states and governments in the world, to forbid the defamation of religions.","Israel should not feel satisfaction at my son's death, for he died on the battlefield, facing the conquerors as he wished, with a gun in his hand.","Any Israeli attack on Lebanon, Iran, Syria or Gaza will be met with a fierce response.","Israel lost their power to intimidate during the second war with Lebanon.","The U.N. Security Council did not to condemn the Qana massacre, due to the U.S. veto.","Those who elected Hamas in Palestine did so on the basis of its political platform.","Peace cannot be unilateral."],"Hassan Rouhani":["A constructive approach to diplomacy doesn't mean relinquishing one's rights. It means engaging with one's counterparts, on the basis of equal footing and mutual respect, to address shared concerns and achieve shared objectives.","I ran on the platform of moderation and won the election by a large margin. By virtue of the strong mandate that I received from the electorate, I am committed to operating in the framework of moderation, which calls inter alia for a balance between realism and the pursuit of the ideals of the Islamic Republic of Iran.","I'm committed to fulfilling my promises to my people, including my pledge to engage in constructive interaction with the world.","No country by itself and in an isolated manner would ever be able to effectively address the challenges it faces.","Global challenges require collective responses.","Iran rejects weapons of mass destruction based on its belief system, its religious belief system, as well as well as its ethical standpoint.","On the nuclear issue, the first point is that the entire world must recognize that Iran does not seek a nuclear weapon, nor shall it seek a nuclear weapon.","The viewpoint of the government is that the people must have full access to all information worldwide.","Citizenship rights is about making all Iranians feel they are part of one nation, one identity, under one umbrella they can feel proud of.","Problems of 35 years cannot be resolved in a short period of time.","We believe that unilateral sanctions violate international law, in fact. They violate free trade. They violate human growth and development, human development, and that when you actually sanction a bank of a country, the meaning of it is quite clear. You're sanctioning medicine for the people.","International politics is no longer a zero-sum game but a multi-dimensional arena where cooperation and competition often occur simultaneously. Gone is the age of blood feuds. World leaders are expected to lead in turning threats into opportunities.","In a world where global politics is no longer a zero-sum game, it is - or should be - counterintuitive to pursue one's interests without considering the interests of others.","I think that the president of Iran has the authority wherever which - where - wherever the national interests of the country are involved and, when it is necessary and expedient and required to speak and talk with others in order to promote the rights of its nation, that the president can take that initiative.","When it comes to nuclear technology, the Iranian people are very sensitive. It is a part of our national pride, and nuclear technology has become indigenous.","We are determined to provide for the nuclear fuel of such plants inside the country, at the hands of local Iranian scientists. We are going to follow on this path.","The Iranian people, with regards to the policies of various American administrations in the past 30 years, are very worried. They don't trust them.","At face value, the U.S. Congress, there is a - they have a long way to go before they fully appreciate and understand Iranian people.","I'm not a historian. I'm a politician. What is important for us is that the countries of the region and the people grow closer to each other, and that they are able to prevent aggression and injustice.","We are not seeking... and looking for war with any nations. We are seeking peace and stability among all the nations in the region.","We want the people, in their private lives, to be completely free, and in today's world, having access to information and the right of free dialogue and the right to think freely is the right of all peoples, including the people of Iran.","The people, when they say 'Death to America!' - do you know what they are really saying? What they mean to say relates to the aggressive policies of the U.S. and intervention and meddling by the U.S.","All countries in my part of the world, we want democracy to prevail. I told the people, 'If you want American policies to stop, we need to take action.' We need to make the U.S. understand that its meddling is inappropriate.","I'll tell you that when an innocent person is killed, we never go about asking or inquiring whether they were Jewish or Christian or Muslim. That's not our way or creed.","I've said before that I am not a historian and that when it comes to speaking of the dimensions of the Holocaust, it is the historians that should reflect on it.","As leaders, we need to rise above petty politics and lead, rather than follow, the various interests and pressure groups in our respective countries."],"Hassanal Bolkiah":["Asean is obviously a very important association for us. Over the past 30 years Asean has made great strides in regional cooperation covering a number of areas, although recently it has been under strain because of the financial crisis and other challenges.","Theory states that Allah's law is cruel and unfair, but Allah himself has said that his law is indeed fair.","The development of our human resources is an area in which we need to do well as it is decisive in determining the success of our diversification programme.","With faith and gratitude to Allah the almighty, I declare that tomorrow, Thursday May 1, 2014, will see the enforcement of sharia law phase one, to be followed by the other phases.","Future peace, prosperity and confidence depend not just on ourselves but on the success of all nations. Hence, we are all partners, no matter what our backgrounds, cultures, faiths and histories.","As a small country, both in size and population, our future hinges on the quality of our people.","Brunei Darussalam is one of the oldest kingdoms in South East Asia.","We are increasing our efforts to attract the right kind of foreign investors through our various agencies.","The nation will benefit in the long term if it continues to be open to foreign expertise. This will help the country to establish its business culture and environment faster, based on international best practice.","The level of our educational development is high and serves as a strong basis for our future progress.","We need foreign skills to stay competitive.","Our strength in finance has led us to set up an international financial centre with medium and long-term objectives, especially to develop Islamic financial and insurance services.","Today, bilateral relations with Britain are excellent, with cooperation in many areas and both countries continuing to work on strengthening these ties.","We are considering various ways of making use of our oil and gas downstream industries. This is to be complemented with the import of oil and gas from other sources as raw materials.","There is no conflict between favouring Islamic and traditional values and being more open and international.","We will host the Asean summit in November this year. It will be an occasion to reflect on our achievements collectively and to look at how Asean can maintain its leading role in regional and international cooperation."],"Hasso Plattner":["At Stanford, we teach 'design thinking' - that is, we put together small, interdisciplinary groups to figure out what the true needs are and then to apply the art of engineering to serve them.","Business reporting is not dealing with objects, it is dealing with relationships between objects.","This is where the world is going: direct access from anywhere to any type of data, whether it's a small piece of data or a small answer but a long algorithm to create that answer. The user doesn't care about this.","There is this permanent hope in America that there is some new technology around the corner that will change the world.","Successful companies obviously have people with ideas and energy.","I'm a Berliner - fast, loud, obnoxious, industrious, brutally open.","New applications will have to deal with big data. We have to analyze it on the fly, so we have to have a system that is transactional and analytical at the same time. We cannot have a multi-stage system. This is too slow for modern applications.","Please, please, please, my dear competition. We can beat each other and fight each other as much as we want and argue, but do not predict how a system really works when you really don't know and don't want to know. Either be better informed, or don't do it.","Managers are important: they are leading the company and guiding and have to provide vision and manage the daily business.","The Y2K problem is not caused by technical limitations. We simply forgot to think of the problem.","The software industry has to become better in componentization. That's a clear focus for most of the software companies. How components look, how they are maintained, the ability to maintain them separately.","Thirty percent of Americans have German blood in their family. I don't see any major difference in the engineering abilities of Americans and Germans.","You cannot make money with a hockey team. You cannot make money with a hotel, either, and you cannot make money with a golf club. I have all three of them. When you have a certain amount of money, you do silly things - because it's pretty to have a golf course and it's interesting to have a hockey team.","We have to be able to adapt to new situation. It's another form of the definition of intelligent behavior.","I would have liked to grow up in Liverpool and become a rocker. I would have put my boots on, jeans and a leather jacket, and long hair and played the guitar.","I'm not just a scientist.","Americans are not afraid of the future.","Kids only learn that the stove is hot when they put their finger on and they burn it. This, unfortunately, is the limitation of our precious brain.","I am grateful for the great education at a public university that Germany gave me, and that - added to a little luck - allowed me to achieve. Education is the key to a career, and its basis has to be provided by government.","I made my money with software - encoded knowledge without which few products and services can exist today - and so it seemed imperative that this would be the field where I would give something back.","I believe that whoever is successful should help ensure that the next generation can be successful, too.","I can't control my frustration.","Africa touches me. At night, there's this thought in your brain that a million years ago we started here.","Fans don't like owners. They know they are somewhere - actually, in Germany, some owners are anonymous. Fans don't sympathize with owners, so ownership stays in the back.","In the '80s, when Gretzky came to the World Championships in the second or third game, you'd see this guy skating circles around the other ones. Unbelievable.","I create, for whatever reason, a busy schedule, but I watch hockey, all the games, either on the PC or TV. The world is now HD, and this is very good.","It's not good if owners of sports teams are talking to sports journalists, bypassing the manager. That goes in the wrong direction wherever it happens. Therefore, I'll refrain from doing this at all."],"Hattie Carnegie":["My clothes are built to show off the woman who wears them. I like them to be simple... to move well, to move with the times and a little ahead of the times.","Taste is so much more important than fashion.","I've had three husbands, but my real romance is my work.","To show the American woman herself off to best advantage - that has always been my aim and that is my real biography."],"Hattie McDaniel":["The entire race is usually judged by the actions of one man or woman.","Putting a little time aside for clean fun and good humor is very necessary to relieve the tensions of our time.","Every actor and actress is possessed of the absorbing passion to create something distinctive and unique.","I always have the best of everything.","I don't belong on this earth. I always feel out of place - like a visitor.","I'm letting no man handle my bank account.","You can best fight any existing evil from the inside.","What is the thing that Hollywood demands most? Sincerity. No place in the world will pay such a high price for this admirable trait.","A woman's gifts will make room for her.","I sincerely hope that I shall always be a credit to my race, and to the motion picture industry.","As for those grapefruit and buttermilk diets, I'll take roast chicken and dumplings.","Bob Hope, Red Skelton, and Eddie Cantor... help us keep our balance.","Faith is the black person's federal reserve system.","I am loathe to get married again. I've been married enough; I just prefer to forget it.","I did my best, and God did the rest.","I've played everything but a harp.","In playing the part of Mammy, I tried to make her a living, breathing character, the way she appeared to me in the book.","It sure looks good to see an honest-to-goodness audience after looking at you all for so long from the silver screen.","My desire for the part of Mammy was not dominated by selfishness for Hollywood has been good to me and I am grateful.","Playing the Mammy of Miss Leigh was just about the biggest thrill I've ever had.","That's a powerful lucky rabbit's foot. I got the part in Gone With the Wind because of it. I got my Warner contract, thanks to it.","We all respect sincerity in our friends and acquaintances, but Hollywood is willing to pay for it.","When I was little, my mother taught me how to use a fork and knife. The trouble is that Mother forget to teach me how to stop using them!"],"Hattie Morahan":["I am fascinated by people's flaws and delusions: all the messy bits of human nature we all try to pretend we don't have.","There's a pressure to conform to particular images, and it feels a pretty exclusive pool of body image or facial image that is considered appealing. And in a way, that feels like pre-judging what an audience might actually want.","What's exciting about theatre is observing human behaviour. You're constantly making judgments about body language, the physical, the emotional, the intellectual.","I am always really buzzed after each performance, and at around one in the morning, I'll hit a brick wall and need to sleep.","I'm sure my mum was a huge influence on my wanting to be an actress: just seeing her doing it, seeing her love it, caring about it. Invest in something, take it seriously and be so wonderful.","I suppose one of the things that interest me about acting is unpicking what makes people tick and why they do what they do and what it means to be human.","For a long time, I did feel aware that I wasn't pretty or bubbly enough. Nor was I sexy-looking.","I've had so many experiences where everyone is very polite about each other's working process, which can lead to work where everyone seems to be in different plays.","Acting on stage is a living organism you can never pin down, and I believe the audience feeds off that, too.","It's true: theatre has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. I always liked everything about it. As a child, I used to get so excited about performing, I'd get the giggles.","When you're young and starting out, the big hurdle is to relax enough in rehearsal so that you don't feel intimidated. The more work you've done, the more you can experiment in rehearsal and not have to worry about getting the sack.","I've obviously got one of those faces that people can forget.","Throughout my life, I've known that if I change my hair, if I change my look, people I know will blank me in the street.","I love the virtuosity and imaginative chutzpah of 'Da Vinci's Demons,' and not just because my boyfriend is in it!","I'm halfway through Patti Smith's memoir 'Just Kids,' which is heart-stoppingly vivid. It drips with beauty and hope and devastating candour. I don't want it to end.","I became hooked on 'In Treatment,' which was so finely written and performed. Such a simple idea, and yet it delved into very complex territory with real grace and humanity.","I heard David Sedaris read live recently which was a complete delight. Few writers make me laugh out loud on the bus. He does.","I'm just interested in things that move me and make me think, make me laugh.","I would definitely say I'm a feminist. To me, it just means being attentive and mindful. It's about equality and equal treatment. It feels like a gut instinct.","Cate Blanchett and Eileen Atkins are definitely among my top five actresses whose work I aspire to.","Because I didn't go to drama school, I didn't start in the business with any toolbox apart from enthusiasm and instinct. I'd throw everything at a part and sometimes realise that I had hit my limits."],"Havelock Ellis":["All the art of living lies in a fine mingling of letting go and holding on.","The family only represents one aspect, however important an aspect, of a human being's functions and activities. A life is beautiful and ideal or the reverse, only when we have taken into our consideration the social as well as the family relationship.","Jealousy, that dragon which slays love under the pretence of keeping it alive.","Every man of genius sees the world at a different angle from his fellows, and there is his tragedy.","The Promised Land always lies on the other side of a Wilderness.","For every fresh stage in our lives we need a fresh education, and there is no stage for which so little educational preparation is made as that which follows the reproductive period.","In the early days of Christianity the exercise of chastity was frequently combined with a close and romantic intimacy of affection between the sexes which shocked austere moralists.","All civilization has from time to time become a thin crust over a volcano of revolution.","The sun, the moon and the stars would have disappeared long ago... had they happened to be within the reach of predatory human hands.","The husband - by primitive instinct partly, certainly by ancient tradition - regards himself as the active partner in matters of love and his own pleasure as legitimately the prime motive for activity.","The absence of flaw in beauty is itself a flaw.","Sex lies at the root of life, and we can never learn to reverence life until we know how to understand sex.","'Charm' - which means the power to effect work without employing brute force - is indispensable to women. Charm is a woman's strength just as strength is a man's charm.","The omnipresent process of sex, as it is woven into the whole texture of our man's or woman's body, is the pattern of all the process of our life.","It is on our failures that we base a new and different and better success.","There is nothing that war has ever achieved that we could not better achieve without it.","The place where optimism most flourishes is the lunatic asylum.","What we call 'morals' is simply blind obedience to words of command.","A man must not swallow more beliefs than he can digest.","If men and women are to understand each other, to enter into each other's nature with mutual sympathy, and to become capable of genuine comradeship, the foundation must be laid in youth.","Failing to find in women exactly the same kind of sexual emotions, as they find in themselves, men have concluded that there are none there at all.","Thinking in its lower grades, is comparable to paper money, and in its higher forms it is a kind of poetry.","Pain and death are part of life. To reject them is to reject life itself.","Dancing is the loftiest, the most moving, the most beautiful of the arts, because it is no mere translation or abstraction from life; it is life itself.","The romantic embrace can only be compared with music and with prayer.","However well organized the foundations of life may be, life must always be full of risks.","I always seem to have a vague feeling that he is a Satan among musicians, a fallen angel in the darkness who is perpetually seeking to fight his way back to happiness.","One can know nothing of giving aught that is worthy to give unless one also knows how to take.","What we call progress is the exchange of one nuisance for another nuisance.","Man lives by imagination.","Every artist writes his own autobiography.","It is only the great men who are truly obscene. If they had not dared to be obscene, they could never have dared to be great.","The greatest task before civilization at present is to make machines what they ought to be, the slaves, instead of the masters of men.","Dreams are real as long as they last. Can we say more of life?","Men who know themselves are no longer fools. They stand on the threshold of the door of Wisdom.","To be a leader of men one must turn one's back on men.","It has always been difficult for Man to realize that his life is all an art. It has been more difficult to conceive it so than to act it so. For that is always how he has more or less acted it.","The prevalence of suicide, without doubt, is a test of height in civilization; it means that the population is winding up its nervous and intellectual system to the utmost point of tension and that sometimes it snaps.","The by-product is sometimes more valuable than the product.","The mathematician has reached the highest rung on the ladder of human thought.","A sublime faith in human imbecility has seldom led those who cherish it astray.","In philosophy, it is not the attainment of the goal that matters, it is the things that are met with by the way.","There has never been any country at every moment so virtuous and so wise that it has not sometimes needed to be saved from itself.","The art of dancing stands at the source of all the arts that express themselves first in the human person. The art of building, or architecture, is the beginning of all the arts that lie outside the person; and in the end they unite.","The more rapidly a civilization progresses, the sooner it dies for another to rise in its place.","The parents have not only to train their children: it is of at least equal importance that they should train themselves.","Education, whatever else it should or should not be, must be an inoculation against the poisons of life and an adequate equipment in knowledge and skill for meeting the chances of life.","At the present day the crude theory of the sexual impulse held on one side, and the ignorant rejection of theory altogether on the other side, are beginning to be seen as both alike unjustified.","It is becoming clear that the old platitudes can no longer be maintained, and that if we wish to improve our morals we must first improve our knowledge.","Of woman as a real human being, with sexual needs and sexual responsibilities, morality has often known nothing.","No act can be quite so intimate as the sexual embrace.","Birth-control is effecting, and promising to effect, many functions in our social life.","The average husband enjoys the total effect of his home but is usually unable to contribute any of the details of work and organisation that make it enjoyable.","The relation of the individual person to the species he belongs to is the most intimate of all relations.","Socialism also brings us up against the hard rock of eugenic fact which, if we neglect it, will dash our most beautiful social construction to fragments.","Still, whether we like it or not, the task of speeding up the decrease of the human population becomes increasingly urgent.","When love is suppressed hate takes its place.","There is a very intimate connection between hypnotic phenomena and religion.","The sanitary and mechanical age we are now entering makes up for the mercy it grants to our sense of smell by the ferocity with which it assails our sense of hearing."],"Hawa Abdi":["When I decided to become a doctor, I was very, very young, when my mother, her seventh child, became pregnant, and she was feeling terrible pain, and I could not know how to help her.

We can make peace.","We women in Somalia are trying to be leaders in our community."],"Hayao Miyazaki":["Plants exist in the weather and light rays that surround them - waving in the wind, shimmering in the sunlight. I am always puzzling over how to draw such things.","I do all my work by storyboard, so as I draw the storyboard, the world gets more and more complex, and as a result, my North, South, East, West directions kind of shift and go off base, but it seems like my staff as well as the audience, doesn't quite realize that this has happened. Don't tell them about it.","Watching John Lasseter's films, I think I can understand better than anyone that what he's doing, is going straight ahead with his vision and working really hard to get that vision into film form. And I feel that my understanding this of him is my friendship towards him.","I don't like games. You're robbing the precious time of children to be children. They need to be in touch with the real world more.","All my films are all my children.","I create women characters by watching the female staff at my studio. Half the staff are women.","I get inspiration from my everyday life.","I am an animator. I feel like I'm the manager of a animation cinema factory. I am not an executive. I'm rather like a foreman, like the boss of a team of craftsmen. That is the spirit of how I work.","Animators can only draw from their own experiences of pain and shock and emotions.","It seems like everything that we see perceived in the brain before we actually use our own eyes, that everything we see is coming through computers or machines and then is being input in our brain cells. So that really worries me.","I think we should stop using nuclear power plants because it's an old system that we can't control.","Currently computer graphics are used a great deal, but it can be excessive.","To have a film where there's an evil figure and a good person fights against the evil figure and everything becomes a happy ending, that's one way to make a film. But then that means you have to draw, as an animator, the evil figure. And it's not very pleasant to draw evil figures.","If you're going to retire, retire early.","We get strength and encouragement from watching children.","I like underwater life.","It would be wonderful if I could see the end of civilization during my lifetime.","I've never studied psychology.","I can't stand modern movies. The images are too weird and eccentric for me.","Humans have both the urge to create and destroy.","I think Tokyo is going to sink under water soon. All those stupid high-rise buildings will sink and maybe all the traffic will be gone. And everything will be peaceful and quiet.","I can't do a film after having debated it. I am unable to do a film while discussing it with my team. I issue directives. I do not achieve it otherwise.","Is someone different at age 18 or 60? I believe one stays the same.","We live in an age when it is cheaper to buy the rights to movies than to make them.","When a man is shooting a handgun, it's just like he is shooting because that's his job, and he has no other choice. It's no good. When a girl is shooting a handgun, it's really something.","I never read reviews. I'm not interested. But I value a lot the reactions of the spectators.","Sometimes I test myself saying, 'If I get a death sentence if I don't make this movie, would I still make this movie?'","I'm not a collector.","I think it's really good for a family or children to have a dog, cat, bird or whatever to grow up with.","I'd like more of the world go back to being wild.","People in Japan have experienced many tsunamis and various earthquakes throughout the ages.","I wish I was better at art. I love some of the great artists of the 19th century and, compared to them, I just feel I lack this technique that they had. They have so much skill.","My process is thinking, thinking and thinking - thinking about my stories for a long time.","I don't intentionally make deep movies."],"Hayden Christensen":["Actors are observers. They're trying to have an understanding of human sensibility. And how do you have that accurate observation if you regard yourself as someone of great importance? When you're the one constantly being observed, because they view you as a celebrity? It's all wrong.","I've always been kind of a hermit.","Everyone has their own approach to how they work.","I'm just this kid from Toronto who got his start.","One of the things I find about acting is that the less the audience knows about the actor, the more they're able to believe in him in the role.","A long time ago, in a country not so far away, I was eight years old, doing my best Darth Vader imitation.","I love acting because it's a bit of an escape. It gives you the ability to reinvent yourself. They say that acting is the shy man's revenge.","I try to stay away from the L.A. scene as much as possible. I feel it helps me to better prepare for my roles if I am not too involved in that whole thing.","I love my mother Ali so much. I'm a momma's boy. I just have a very cool mom. It's not as though I had any say in the matter. I'm just really fortunate. She's the most kind, loving, giving woman.","I have two sisters and a mother, obviously, so I grew up with a household of girls. Maybe I have a greater respect for women because of it.","I wish they taught green screen acting classes.","I don't find Hollywood interesting, so I'm thinking of studying architecture instead.","For me, when I'm making a movie I like to stay in character throughout the day.","Between takes I find it difficult to switch off and then try and re-emerge myself in the part, so I try to stay in that frame of mine all day. It can be exhausting and you lose a sense of self, but it is the method that works best for me."],"Hayden Fry":["You just witnessed an old-fashioned rump kicking.","We'll take what the other team gives us. We'll scratch where it itches.","Welcome to the Salvation Army. I've never been associated with an offense so nice about giving the ball away.","If you stay with this game long enough, the worm is bound to turn.","We changed our image. At least when we ran out on the field or broke the huddle, we would look like winners.","I wanted the players to feel like they were part of a family, to be conscious of that controlled togetherness as they made that slow entrance onto the field. It had a great psychological effect on the opposing team, too. They'd never seen anything like it.","The preparation I had in college was the most valuable.","You can't control people. You must understand them. You have to know where they're coming from, their beliefs and values, what turns them off, what they're against.","We probably spend more time talking about individual players in our coaching sessions than anything else.","We're the only dance in town. We don't compete with any professional teams for the entertainment dollar.","How can a coach have any influence over a player that's making over five times more than he is?","The people who run a university are far more qualified and intelligent in handling people than someone who inherited his money and used it to buy a pro team.","In football, like in life, you must learn to play within the rules of the game.","I learned a great many things in the Marines that helped me as a football coach. The Marines train men hard and to do things the right way, just as a football team must train.","I'll be here in my home with three big screens.

But I'm not one of those crazy girls who thinks that they're fat. I'm okay with what I have. I can rock this body, you know?","Some people ask me whether I'm a 'mama's girl' or a 'papa's girl.' I'm nobody's girl. My brother clings to our parents; I'm the one shoving them out the door.","You just have this freedom when you're younger - this lack of concern to fail or do anything wrong. It comes with an ease that I've found has kind of deteriorated over time.","I've always wanted to be a Meryl Streep or a Natalie Portman. I want to do all kinds of different movies, to be a chameleon. I don't want to limit myself.","I've always described my taste in fashion and music as being very eclectic and uniquely based off my feelings that day. That's the wonderful thing about style. You can be whatever you want to be. You can describe yourself however you want to describe yourself.","You go on these Internet blogs and people say the meanest things. I'm a normal person. Just because I'm in the spotlight doesn't mean I'm God's gift to the world. I'm learning and making mistakes just like every other 17-year-old girl out there.","The funny thing is that people see one film like 'Racing Stripes' or 'Ice Princess' and all of a sudden, slip me into this category of 'that's what she's always involved in.'","There is something about street dogs, about rescues; they have this knowing sense about them.","People can tell when you're happy with being you and when you're not. It's only cheesy because it's true. As I've gotten older and grown into my body, I've started realizing that the way you carry yourself and that light coming out of your eyes are the most attractive things about you.","I find when I'm overly concerned about what I eat, I stress out my body and put on weight.","I know it sounds absurd, but 11 months old, I did my first commercial.","I remember hearing in first grade, 'Oh, why does she get to skip school?' It wasn't like I suddenly started feeling different. I always knew that I was. I never felt I missed out.","When it comes to relationships, it's nice to have something that is your own and not everyone else's. That's not part of my job. I never stood up on a podium and said, 'Vote for me - I'm perfect. I'll be this for you and never do anything wrong.'","The frustrating part of it is that you're generally known for what you did last. I've had the privilege of doing some very cool independent films that, a lot of the time, the general public doesn't see unless you're at a film festival or you're into that kind of movie.","Every girl likes feeling hot and sexy and beautiful and likes hearing it.","I can be very dry and sarcastic.","I actually had an experience where I thought somebody was breaking into my house. That's got to be the most terrified I've ever been in my life. I don't know if that's saying much. The fear, especially as a female in a house by yourself, was horrible.","I like to dedicate myself wholeheartedly to a cause so that I have more impact. My goal is to shed light on the beauty of the ocean and how important it is for our planet.","When I turned 18, was the first time that I really started concentrating on politics. And I started doing so because I realized that in order to really create and generate change, it has to come from changing laws... so I started campaigning for Norman Lear's foundation, which was Declare Yourself.","We commend President Obama and his administration for taking this strong action against Iceland and its barbaric whaling industry... and we urge the President to take similar action against Japan and Norway as well!","I really had a rough time in middle school. Middle school to me was the way most people explain high school. Then in high school I had a blast. I basically did everything that you would do in high school or in college, so it really wasn't a difficult thing to pull out.","I spend so much time with the brightest and most talented and well-rounded people. I've had the privilege of having long and very intellectual conversations with people, and sometimes I just sit there and listen. It's like a better version of a class. Even though I'm not sitting at a desk and in school, I'm still learning all the time."],"Hayden Schlossberg":["When you hit 30, it's that time of self-reflection. Some people are a success. Some people feel like they haven't achieved what they wanted to. Some people are married, some have kids, some are still single.","I just went to Hebrew school, had a bar mitzvah. No crazy weird Jewish cult.","If you think that something worked and your directing partner doesn't think so, then maybe you have to re-think what you were doing.","One of the things that made 'American Pie' great was also the sexiness of it.","A lot of times in movies, especially in sequels, the characters become caricatures and just sort of improv machines and joke machines, rather than people you can actually connect to.","If you look at Christmas movies, there are certain things in them that lend themselves to a 'Harold & Kumar' movie. In particular, the more out-of-this-world things like Santa Claus and flying reindeer.","When you watch the first 'American Pie' movie, you're like... 'I know that jock who's kind of sweet and has a girlfriend, and I know that weird off-beat kid.'","There's an art to stupid comedy. There's an art to offensive comedy, and I think the key is it's just gotta make you laugh.","It wasn't a conscious decision to actually make a movie about Guantanamo Bay. It was a device."],"Hayes MacArthur":["Do I believe in love at first sight? I think, like anything, you fall in love, and you see how things progress.","I've been watching cop procedurals my entire life, so when I saw an opportunity to make fun of one, I jumped at it.","The Carells are huge fans of comedy. To get in there and see how sick and twisted their mind is is fun to do.","Being on a weekly series, you see these people so much, and you have these genuine interactions with them where if you're away doing a film, it's a little different because there's - these definite end dates to everything.","Helen Hayes was my great-aunt.","My mom was a singer in Chicago and still is a cabaret singer, and she was very theatrical. And my dad's such a character at the dinner table."],"Hayley Atwell":["My real self, the self I have always been from a child, is a loner and nerd, slightly overweight, with a very heavy fringe. That is who I was as a kid. I don't think I will ever be anything other than that.","I am often lost in my own world, with a frown on my face.","I love firing guns. It's an amazing feeling - so sexy and powerful.","I'd love to do an action movie. Something with lots of stunts. Anything fast and dangerous and involving guns.","My first job was a Greek tragedy, and ever since, one job just seemed to roll onto the next. I've been terribly lucky.","I like characters who have faults. I'm drawn to darker people.","I'm not really into makeup, not really into fuffing with hair and stuff.","The main reason I did 'Captain America' was because I wanted to get out of my own head and stop taking my work so seriously.","I don't think I'm curvaceous. It's simply that most other actresses are really, stupidly tiny.","Mum wasn't at all religious, but she thought that going to the theatre was as important a ceremonial, communal experience that a person could have.","From a very young age, stories fuelled my imagination in the most wonderful way.","I'm deeply ambitious and I always have been.","I think American guys tend to be a bit more forward, a bit more chatty and open than the Brits. The Brits seem to have a darker sense of humor, though I have met some Americans who have adopted bits of the British dry sense of humor as well.","I have family dotted everywhere - Dad's in California; I've got aunts in Scotland and Virginia; family in Kansas City; family in Manchester and London.","I think Brits probably feel that Americans are more like us than vice-versa, if that makes sense. Because we get everything American over here in Britain, but yet there are things which are staunchly English that you guys don't have.","I can't imagine it if beauty was the only currency I used as an actress. It just doesn't interest me.","It's people's worst fantasy to see their partner kissing someone else, even though it's a job and it's not real.","Although I grew up in London, I spent summers in Missouri, where my dad lived. It's quite a liberal town, Kansas City. You'd be surprised.","Because I trained in theater, I always leave a film shoot feeling like I haven't done anything, like I just sat in front of the camera and whispered, essentially.","When actors get a bad name for diva behavior - I've never seen it. Because my experience with people who are really famous actors is that they work really hard.","I went to drama school for three years, and the whole thing there is that hopefully you are introduced to a man called William Shakespeare who is the greatest of all time of all storytelling.","I think it's always easier to play parts that you have something concrete that you can relate to.","The things that prey on my mind in London seem to disappear as soon as I find myself in a different environment. Survival mode kicks in.","Documenting trips makes them that much richer. I stick in train tickets and business cards from restaurants. It makes the whole experience poetic, describing the sights, smells and sounds around me. It means I can relive the holiday years later.","I read a lot of heavy literature when I'm on set, so on holiday I want to indulge in something light-hearted.","Skiing in Whistler was great fun. It's an extreme environment that's very different to my own and I had never skied before, so I had to learn to take on the elements quite bravely. It was nice to try something new."],"Hayley Hasselhoff":["I love the idea of embracing your curves and loving yourself while expressing it through fashion.","People dwell so much on the little things, but why should they hold you back when you have the big things to look forward to? By exuding positive energy when dealing with your problems, you will exude it in your being in general. Treat yourself with love and you will exude love to others.","Find what makes you feel comfortable. The confidence you wear your clothes in is what's really going to shine.","Who you are as a person is more special than trying to be someone you're not. Don't get me wrong - I have bad days, everyone does, but I know if I'm feeling insecure today, I'll move on tomorrow. I'd tell girls to realise it's OK to have bad days to get to the good ones.","I'm comfortable with being a voluptuous woman because I'm not going to be a size two and that's ok with me.","It's all about confidence and how you feel about yourself. There's no such thing as a perfect woman. I like imperfections - that's what makes you unique.","I live my life with positivity, so even if there was a low, I'd find a positive in the situation. It's how I am with everything in life. With acting, I don't love the celebrity side of it and the tabloids, but at the end of the day, I love what I do so much, it overrides all that.","Everyone loves good looks, but personality is what sells for me. I want someone to have fun and go on adventures with. I do like guys with tattoos, though.","At the end of the day, it just means 'curvy.' That's why I think the word 'plus-size' in the industry is very different from people's mind view of what 'plus-size' really should mean.","Fashion can always be a part of your life no matter what shape or size you are. You don't need to feel like you have to fit into a box because you aren't a certain size that your favorite designer carries.","Plus-size girls can look to the Plus-Size Fashion Weekends and feel like it's special - it's something for them and for their bodies.","I'm an over-packer 100 percent. I can't do it; I physically can't under-pack.","People have this conception of plus size models as girls who aren't fit or don't work out or don't really take care of their bodies.","I've never worn plus size brands, and I never had to because I found what worked for my body type. So my advice is to find what works for you.","I am comfortable with who I am as a person. I've never felt that pressure of feeling like I need to fit into something else or be something else because that's not me. I work out and I'm healthy, but that's not to lose weight; that's just to feel good.","I just like talking, and I'm really truthful. Sometimes things come out of my mouth, and I think, 'Maybe I shouldn't have said that,' but at the end of the day, I am who I am! When I'm not acting, I'm going to be fully Hayley Hasselhoff, and that's what you're going to get. And I enjoy that.","We're getting to this amazing place where the average size in America is a 14-16, and we're starting to see that represented in the fashion industry, and it's becoming more accepted.","My first shoot was on a rooftop in swimsuits with two plus-size models who were curvy and voluptuous and beautiful, and they taught me so much about being beautiful in any shape or size.","Straight sized boards are models size 0-6. Plus size boards are models starting at a 10. If a size 8 girl was 5' 11 and curvy, she'd be on the plus sized board, because there's nothing in between.","The clothes at Style369 are fashionable - and have a great sense of fit for curvy girls.","I'm so glad teenagers can look up to young girls and realize it's okay to be voluptuous.","We're fit, we're healthy, we eat right, we work out. 'Plus size model' does not mean that we're not healthy. Plus size is not glamourising obesity: it's about empowering. The message behind the fashion is feeling confident in whatever you're wearing.","The plus size movement is not just about fashion; it's about body image, and if we're doing a shoot, they won't retouch us at all. That's the cool thing: there's no retouching at all because we want to give girls the truth, not a fabrication.","The message behind every brand that's plus size is about making a woman feel confident in any shape or size. Now straight size, it's all about the signature brand and how to look good in that one brand, and not necessarily how to look good for yourself.","An Australian girl size 12 and a Swedish girl size 12 are completely different, just because of the way they're formed. It's becoming this worldwide movement because people are getting it. We all have two different parents; we're not supposed to look the same. It's ridiculous.","My parents always told me I'm beautiful the way that I am, and I never thought to myself that I needed to be skinny because there's a magazine out there that said, 'Oh, size two,' or, 'Oh, this girl's beautiful because she's skinny.'","Working out, for me, gives me energy in the day and just makes me happy."],"Hayley Kiyoko":["We all want to be loved. We all want to feel accepted. We all want to feel content. And life is hard.","My motto is to help people love themselves sooner. I can't teach them how to do that. They have to figure that out on their own - that's their journey.","My friends call my style 'old man chic.' I wear loafers and stylish sweatpants. I love to stay comfortable, so I definitely funk it up, but I'm always comfortable. I wear lots of hats and feathers, and I kind of have a little obsession with Native American jewelry.","I know who I am and what I want to say and what I'm supposed to sound like.","I loved the idea of how all these guys always are stealing other guys' girls and I was like, 'There's no female anthem for a girl stealing another guy's girl,' and that is the coolest thing ever.","It's wonderful to see parents come together and openly support their LGBTQ kids at my shows.","My journey has really been trying to normalize girls loving girls.","I've always wanted my lyrics to say something meaningful and, you know, you always want to tell a message with your art. So yes, as I continue to write music, I will write about things that are real and things that I feel aren't written about a lot.","Everyone uses art for different reasons: We use it as entertainment. We use it as an escape. We use it as comfort. Everyone uses it for different reasons.","I just love storytelling. I write music to tell stories. So when I'm done writing a song, I take it and go, 'Okay. How can I interpret these lyrics differently?' I love taking lyrics that were so close to me at a certain point in my life and then revamping them. I always want to take things to the next level.","In the dating game, the world is difficult because people don't communicate, or they communicate, but then their actions speak louder than words.","I love women, but I also respect them.","I'm grateful to the LGBTQ community for giving me the courage to write music about who I am and not just about my sexual orientation.","I just want to make art that connects with people and moves them on an emotional level. Any time I can put out music and place a story behind it and have people watch it and go, 'Wow, I was affected by that,' to me, feels like I've done my job.","On a very small scale, I kind of understand why the directors that I work with do certain things. I don't consider myself an incredible director. I'm not ready to do movies by any means. But, I feel like I can be a better actress now that I've been on the other side and kind of understand the process and more of the technical aspects of it.","I've been parading around, leading people, being loud, since forever.","I think it's just important for people to lead by example.","Being young is so hard. You're surrounded by judgment and fear.","I like to be a part of shows that are trying to make waves and changes.","When I'm on set, I'm on set, and I focus and get the work done. Then when I'm done, I kind of have this button that I switch. I'm constantly switching this button and putting on different masks, and that kind of keeps me organized.","My mom choreographed the top Olympians; she's really the queen of ice in her world, so I kind of get my directorial bug from her because she's really good at telling people what to do!","It's tough as an artist to have such a specific vision for your video in mind when you write a song. Reaching out to directors is like going on blind dates and trying to find someone who sees the exact vision behind your music, which can be really difficult.","I really never imagined that I could ever even direct anything, so 'Girls Like Girls' was co-directed.","The music industry is such a different world from the acting world. Everything is really last minute, but I love the challenge, and I love owning my material and being able to put out what I want.","For me, I think 'Jem' fans were expecting a remake of the cartoon, and the movie really is inspired by the cartoon based in a 2015, modern-day setting. It is going to be very different, but it's also going to be very familiar as well.","My hair has been this chapter thing for me. In 'Jem,' I have blue hair. 'Insidious,' it's pink. In 'CSI,' I have blonde. I love changing my hair. It's just hair and it grows all the time.","I just tend to date straight girls. That's my problem: I'm a turner.","I've always wanted to do a video of me following a girl down the street. Michael Jackson's done it. Omarion's done it. All these male pop artists have followed women down streets in videos - it's kind of the classic thing. And I was like, there is no video of a girl following a girl down the street. I need to do this at some point in my life.","That's the whole point of my trying to achieve success in mainstream pop - to have straight people sing to my music that has a 'she' pronoun in it.","I did not want to be the gay artist, and I talked to my manager all the time, like, I don't want to lead with that. I didn't want people to look at me like that's all I am.","I personally feel like people shouldn't have to come out. That, to me, was like a moment for myself where I was coming out to myself with, like, 'Okay, I can be the artist that I want to be, and as long as the music is good, people will accept me. It doesn't matter who I am, what I look like. If the music is good, they will like me. The end.'","I felt like people weren't going to accept me as a pop artist.","When I approach my music and my music videos, obviously all of the subjects and stories that I tell come from an honest, truthful place and the experiences that I've had.","My goal has always been to just be a person who makes great art.","Everything I do I believe in 100 percent, and I believe it's important.","I grew up hip-hop dancing; I've always wanted to create music that I could dance to.","I thought I would be in a band like Arcade Fire or be like Fiona Apple - but pop just made sense to me.","For me, every music video is a hurdle. Every time I do a music video, I'm constantly fighting to get my point across. As a gay woman, that's also a big hurdle."],"Hayley McFarland":["I did a lot of musical theatre when I was younger, so I would love to go back and do that again someday.","I am a longtime fan of 'Freaks and Geeks'.","'Gilmore Girls' was the first show I ever worked on and was my absolute favorite show at the time.","I haven't been on very many vacations, but I like Coronado Island, and Disney World was fun."],"Hayley Mills":["Roses are my favourite flower, and my mum always grew a lot of them.","I always say a tremendous amount of healing is in your own hands.","Wherever I am in the world, I never get Sunday night blues. I suppose it's because I've never worked at any one thing long enough to start hating it.","My father was an inspiration to me; I made a few movies with him and I loved working with him. Everything about him - his whole approach to work, as well as his love, enthusiasm and respect for it and other people in the business - was inspiring. I was very lucky to have him as a role model.","If ever I feel I might be able to tackle it, I'd love to try holding a spear or something in the theater, or opening a door, or anything, just to try it, you know, because it must be some marvelous magic thing.","I have a horror of being in confined spaces.","I cry in movies a lot, and over books.","Once cancer happens it changes the way you live for the rest of your life.","There are some fantastic, brilliant alternative doctors out there.","It doesn't make sense that there is only one way of dealing with cancer.","I have a lot of mirrors around my house, not because I like to look at myself, but because I like the light and perspective they bring to a room.","My best feature is my hair.","When you start acting as a child, you grow up ahead of your movies.","Even when I became the typical shy adolescent, I never minded performing. I felt there was a kind of safety, a protection about being on stage, about losing myself in another character.","Do I think I'm under-educated? Academically, absolutely. I never took any exams, no O- or A-levels.","My sons are precious to me and I have tried incredibly hard to strike the right balance between work and home life while being acutely aware that I haven't always got it right.","In my life, things have happened to me. I've never felt I was controlling anything.","I live in jeans and own a lot of them. I'm much more comfortable in trousers and T-shirts, and I don't often wear dresses.","I like solitary pursuits, such as reading or pottering about in the garden.","I'm a lazy creature when I'm not acting.","There's such an energy bounding around New York, I can't help but get swept along in it.","I admire tremendously those people who work consistently at the same jobs."],"Hayley Orrantia":["I can't stand jelly shoes. They're ugly and not comfortable.","I love Whitney Houston. I absolutely love her song, 'I Wanna Dance With Somebody.'","Sitcoms always made the most sense to me. I grew up watching them every day with my dad. Every Monday, Tuesday night, we would be sitting in front of the television watching any kind of sitcom. I connect with that more, but I love to do whatever kind of role.","I mainly like to do singer/songwriter kind of stuff.","I am a singer first and foremost. I was lucky enough to have a manager, when I was 15, who knew the heads of a lot of record labels at the time.","I'm a Texas girl.","Whenever you go into an audition, you have to be as prepared as possible.","I watched 'I Love the '80s' on VH1.","Every time I tried writing my own songs, they would come out very country. I couldn't fight it, and the more I listened to country music, the more I loved it, and it just became very natural.","I really don't understand jelly shoes - those see-through, glittery, sandal-type things that girls wear. I cannot, for the life of me, understand why they were ever popular.","I definitely make time for music.","Music has always been my first love, so making music happen is a big priority of mine.","I would love for 'The Goldbergs' to continue for as long as we can possibly let it happen, because it's my favorite thing I've ever done, and I can't imagine my life without it.","I am a super social person. I'm an only child, so I thrive on social settings and being around my friends because I make them my siblings. When I'm not acting or singing or working on anything, I am making new relationships with people because, to me, my friendships are very important."],"Hayley Williams":["Whether I'm being influenced by new music that I'm listening to, books I've read, my friends, or my faith, I'm learning all the time.","The truth is, no matter what your lifestyle or occupation, nothing can really stop you when you're allowing yourself to be exactly who you want to be.","I learn every day what it means to love myself, and I'm constantly figuring out what makes me feel empowered.","Performing is the craziest workout for me, because I feel like, on the first day of tour, I'm going nuts. Halfway through, I'm just so tired but obviously you keep pushing yourself because you have fans watching you.","The choices that we make aren't always perfect but it's ok... It's part of the journey.","Sometimes it takes a good fall to really know where you stand.","My mom was a huge Adam and the Ants fan. My granddad listened to a lot of Motown and Elvis and Johnny Cash. So I was kind of well-rounded.","I enjoy punk, the attitude as well as the music, but I don't feel like I have to be a carbon copy of it and invite all this controversy just to be punk rock.","Paramore will be the neighbor that comes over for tea and never leaves.","I think it's important for bands to rough it. Whether you're in a van or a bus, it's still tough. You still have to stand in a two hour catering line with flies everywhere in the heat, and you still have to lug your gear.","What motivates me is seeing people in the crowd and wondering what they're going home to and what they're dealing with, and knowing that for the time being we're their escape.","'Looper' was so brilliant, and it took me forever to finally see it, but the way that movie ends and the message behind that is so selfless.","I tend to enjoy proving people wrong.","No, I'm not a vegetarian. I do eat that way. I actually eat vegan quite a lot. I feel better when I eat that way, and I think there's been a lot of proof that's come up over the last however many years, that you can't deny, I don't think, that meat or dairy aren't all that good for us.","I met P. Diddy. Or Diddy. I like to call him Puffy because, let's be honest, that's who he is.","For me, embracing my own power is about embracing my right to be an individual.","People perceive punk rock in the sense of Sid Vicious, all strung-out, crazy and insane.","I'm not sorry for who I am.","When I was in elementary school, I was a big fan of the zip-off pants that could be turned into shorts. The Delia's catalog used to be my bible.","I always knew I wanted to be in a band.","I know a lot of people think L.A. and they see a picture in their head, but those people obviously don't know me, because I sit on a couch every day. That's my idea of a good time - just being in a sweat suit.","I just feel like bands always need to work harder than the hardest working band. You need to constantly be one-upping yourself and surprising yourself at how hard that you'll work and devote yourself to your craft.","Being on my own in a studio is really, really different than making music with the band. I can't say I necessarily enjoy it more, but it was just a new experience for me.","I stay away from dairy and I drink almond milk now. And I've also found that eating breakfast, like waking up and actually having it, helps me stay way healthy.","Oh yeah, I don't eat a lot of candy on tour. When I get home, man, I love candy. Oh, man, and ice cream. I can't eat it on tour because of the sugar and my throat."],"Haylie Duff":["I think the first thing you should learn is how to roast a chicken. Once you can roast a chicken, you can pretty much figure out anything else. And who doesn't like roasted chicken? It's a classic.","I love the idea of farm to table and farmer's markets. I enjoy a meal more if I know I'm eating something that's good quality and good for me.","I am a Christian, but I also don't really see myself as a religious person. I see myself as more of a spiritual person.","I like making stories and characters that people can relate to. I also like giving the audience a departure from whatever they're thinking about in their life and enjoying a show or a movie.","When I was a kid - and I don't know why, it's the most random thing - I wanted to be a speech therapist for little kids. I knew I wanted to do something with kids.","I guess I would be most grateful for my family and my friends and my dogs, my boyfriend. I'm grateful for a lot. I'm grateful to be healthy.","There are things that I do agree with in Christianity and things that I don't agree with. I'm not a regular churchgoer, but I do think that I have my own beliefs that I feel strongly about.","I have a very small group of friends that I've had - the three of them - for the majority of my life.","We were never the family that ordered pizza, and my mom never came home with a bucket of fried chicken. My mom always made home-cooked meals. We always sat down at the dinner table as a family.","I'm not a trained chef. I'm a self-taught cook, and I want people to be like, 'Yo, I could do that! Maybe I didn't think to or maybe it seemed harder than it really is.'","I was 12 when I got a small part in a movie in Texas. And in my spare time, I play with my dogs and write music and go out with my friends.","With theater, you have to really be able to listen and to respond to other people on stage. You're all constantly on your toes. And then with film and television, you can get a second take and things like that.","It's funny the way life works. Sometimes you go around in a weird path to find out exactly what it is that you love to do, and I'm happy that I've sort of discovered something that makes me really happy.","I was always a huge fan of Nora Ephron.","I love to cook. It is a simple pastime."],"Haywood Nelson":["Hold on to that. You have an autograph. I'm going to be famous some day.","I stayed close to my family. My family never changed.","My family was my guide to my reality.","I had the opportunity to do what I enjoy.","Some might not know that 'What's Happening' was the television version of 'Cooly High.' When I went on the audition, it was an audition for exactly that: the TV version of the movie.","I'm blessed, and people's responses to me have never been negative.","I love people who are fearless, and I'm a spiritual guy, so I connect with people spiritually.","I hope that when people see my body of work, they will say, 'That brother dropped it for real on us, even at the expense of his own image.'"],"Hazel Keech":["I would participate in stage shows during my school days.","My strengths are my flexibility from all those years of dancing. I have got nice thin arms and slim legs, which both looked really toned and tight after one day of working out.","It feels nice when people recognise you and talk about your work.","People are not what they seem. Some of them are sweet and kind to you, but that's not their real face.","'Mother India' is a classic that I love.","I always remove my makeup before sleeping and moisturise before bed and in the morning.","When I was little, I watched a lot of Disney movies - so I always imagined a big fairytale wedding as a kid. But when marriage became real, I felt an intimate wedding with close family and friends would be better.","I like picking up accessories as and when I see something I like - whether its from my travels on the streets of a foreign country or more mainstream labels like Accessorize.","When I came to Mumbai in 2005 for a holiday, I received work offers. So I decided to stay back and pursue a modelling and acting career.","If I am not enjoying my exercise regime, I am not enjoying my life, which means I am wasting it!","Sometimes I get a little lazy, so that's a problem. When I am travelling and am very busy with work, I don't get time to work out, so starting up again and getting back into a routine is difficult.","I think Ryan Reynolds has a fab physique: he's not bulky but nicely toned and proportioned.","I never really had the time for a proper bachelorette party.","'Bigg Boss' has been a great experience, and I will treasure it for rest of my life.","I am with the entertainment industry since the age of 12.","I used to do small roles in Western films.","I worked in the second, third, and fourth editions of 'Harry Potter.' I played one of the students.","When I came to India, it's just a different country, but the culture was same that I grew up in.","I was born and brought up in London, so I couldn't speak Hindi properly. But as I am socialising more with my Hindi speaking friends, I'm getting better at the language.","I am a professional dancer, so picking up dance steps was like brushing my teeth.","Bollywood has taught me a lot of lessons. Sometimes it has been very hard, but every struggle and obstacle that I overcame made me stronger and made me more aware.","Sometimes some people don't want you to do well, but it's fine, as such is life.","I hadn't made up my mind whether I had to do Hollywood or Bollywood films because I loved both, and I grew up on both. So I am glad that Bollywood chose me.","I love performances that move me, like Waheeda Rehman in any of her roles.","Actors that don't look like they're acting and stories that are told well inspire me.","There is no formula to enter Bollywood. It's a lot to do with luck.","I don't know what people like to see.","Dancing improved my fitness level and endurance.","I am not a foodie, per se, but believe that whatever one eats has to match with exercise. So I eat what is healthy, avoid junk food and sugar. I also make sure that I drink plenty of water.","I believe in a combination of exercises like yoga and Crossfit.","I was guilty of using beauty products without consulting a dermatologist. So I've developed a sensitive skin.","With social media, there is a fashion that we speak louder than we think. It has just become a platform where people just judge and spread anger and hate.","I do think that it's unfair to criticise anyone if they are having a bad day.","These cricketers work so hard, be it training schedules or their diet.","Cancer is something that can happen to anyone, like a sportsperson who is eating right and doing his bit correctly. Cancer really takes your life away."],"Hazel Scott":["Who ever walked behind anyone to freedom? If we can't go hand in hand, I don't want to go.","I've always known I was gifted, which is not the easiest thing in the world for a person to know, because you're not responsible for your gift, only for what you do with it.","There's only one free person in this society, and he is white and male.","I think we musicians are emissaries. Every time we go before the public, we're there to make converts.","There's a time when you have to explain to your children why they're born, and it's a marvelous thing if you know the reason by then.","I have always respected everyone's religion. As I say, there is only one God and a lot of confused people."],"Hazrat Inayat Khan":["The words that enlighten the soul are more precious than jewels.","A person however learned and qualified in his life's work in whom gratitude is absent, is devoid of that beauty of character which makes personality fragrant.","I have seen all souls as my soul, and realized my soul as the soul of all.","Everything in life is speaking in spite of it's apparent silence."],"Heath Ledger":["The reason that you dance and sing is to make the audience feel like they're dancing and singing. As long as you're having fun with it and giving it 100 percent, they're gonna feel that.","If you make decisions based upon people's reactions or judgments then you make really boring choices.","I only do this because I'm having fun. The day I stop having fun, I'll just walk away.","I'm not good at future planning. I don't plan at all. I don't know what I'm doing tomorrow. I don't have a day planner and I don't have a diary. I completely live in the now, not in the past, not in the future.","If you're just safe about the choices you make, you don't grow.","I feel like I'm wasting time if I repeat myself.","I never took an acting class, so I've made all my mistakes on film.","I'm still a kid. I'm like six years old. But it's just a matter of wanting to get up, it's just a big journey. I felt like when I left home that I was on a journey, and I still am.","I'm just not one of those naturally funny, relaxed actors who enjoy the spotlight and are so good at it.","There's nothing like working with your mates - it's the way it should be, as far as I'm concerned.","In order not to hold a frame with someone, you have to be intimidated by them.","Anyone that has a job that takes them away from home, I think, can understand the difficulties in maintaining consistency, not only with your family and those you love but with your friends.","Had I listened to my agent, I'd be running around in tights, climbing buildings and stuff.","I've never figured out who 'Heath Ledger' is on film: 'This is what you expect when you hire me, and it will be recognizable.'","I like to do something I fear.","If you are just safe about the choices you make, you don't grow.","I don't feel like I have anything to lose, so I don't really understand what I'm putting at risk.","I thought, I need to be more cautious about my choices - it reflects on who I am.","I'm kind of addicted to moving.","In a way, I was spoon-fed, if you will, a career. It was fully manufactured by a studio that believed that they could put me on their posters and turn me into their bottle of Coca-Cola, their product.","I do keep pre-occupied.","It's kind of a rule of thumb for me to self-doubt going into any kind of project. I always think that I shouldn't be doing it and I don't know how to do it and I'm going to fail and that I fooled them. I always try to find a way out.","When I'm not acting, I do like to take a year off at a time, at least if I can, just in order to keep acting exciting - otherwise I get bored very quickly.","When I first started acting, I was just crap.","It can be a little distressing to have to overintellectualize yourself.","I never want to feel like I've achieved my goal. It's like Chinese farmers. They never admit that it's a good season. They feel like they'll be punished.","I like to set up obstacles and defeat them.","I'm happy without money.","I am not a public speaker and never will be.","I don't have that much forward planning about what I want to do next, or in the future.","I generally don't think most situations can be labeled as black or white.","I wasn't going to have fun doing a teen movie again.","In my opinion, New York City police officers are brave.","If you spend all day on horseback, and you hop off, you walk around like you still have a horse between your legs. And it affects your shoulders. They fall.","My life is together, both professionally and socially.","You learn more about yourself through your child, I guess.","It's rare that there's a role that requires an Australian accent.","I apologize for my terrible interview skills.","I'm in control of my life, not anyone in Hollywood.","It's odd, that's why I don't like telling people I played field hockey. It's real big in Australia for guys. But I say I played in America, and everybody goes, 'Oh, you girl!'","From 18 to 22, I was alone, living in L.A. with a bunch of friends, partying.","When I started to watch some of the films I'd done, I realized I was doing movies that I might not actually want to see.","I want to do theatre. I love theatre.","I don't know, as long as I get to evolve and grow as an actor and as a person, that's the stuff I'm after.","I didn't want to raise my child in Hollywood.","I have a lot of great distractions outside of acting.","I felt like my career was out of my hands.","I love acting and I have a lot of fun.","You know, I'm not in a hurry, and everybody else in Hollywood - particularly agents and managers - they're all in a hurry.","I feel like I've never been in a film that people have liked before."],"Heather Bresch":["There is simply no substitute for hard work when it comes to achieving success.","My great-grandfather started in the coal mines, and my great grandmother made 10 pounds of bread every Saturday morning that we delivered to the neighbors. It was always about giving back. These kinds of things drive me to make a difference.","As a leader, these attributes - confidence, perseverance, work ethic and good sense - are all things I look for in people. I also try to lead by example and create an environment where good questions and good ideas can come from anyone.","I would say that the pharmaceutical industry is hyper-competitive from a global perspective.","My experiences with gender bias are probably the norm. What I found was that expectations of women were simply lower, and this resulted in being overlooked for certain opportunities.","There's going to be good things that get you, and there's going to be bad things that get you, so you better be willing, and your skin better be thick.","I'm not in public service, nor do I ever plan to be, but I give back in my own way.","Treating everyone with dignity and respect is of utmost importance to me and are values we instill and take very seriously at Mylan.","The pricing of a pharmaceutical product is opaque and frustrating, especially for patients.","The most important characteristic that has allowed me to succeed is confidence. I have always been comfortable in my own skin, and even when I was just starting out in my career, had the strength and self-assurance to ask tough questions and push for answers.","I'd like to believe that achieving a leadership position is all about competency, capability and ambition, so I try not to distinguish between the sexes when it comes to giving career advice.","I certainly, to this day, believe I did everything I needed to do to get my degree.","Life's messy.","The pharma pricing system was not built on the idea of consumer engagement. It was built... on market efficiencies. It was not built on the premise of consumerism.","Look, I think if you've got a niche portfolio or just operating in one country, like the United States, your ability to absorb the volatility is much less.","People are starting to understand: all generic companies aren't created equally.","When I hear things like 'unpatriotic,' I just chalk it up to a lot of political rhetoric.","Tax has generated a significant amount of discussion, and companies are forced to do what they can to maintain that global competitiveness and perform.","Someone in Washington needs to get serious about fixing the tax code. That is what needs to happen.","Political service is important because it's about helping others help themselves. That was engrained in me from a young child.","I'm fortunate that Mylan provides this platform that we can make a difference in the lives of people. I'm blessed.","We are driven by the belief that every person in this world matters and access to better health is a right, not a privilege.","Throughout our history we have been tireless advocates for expanding access to high-quality, affordable medicine. This is especially true in the area of HIV/AIDS.","The value that the generic drug industry brings to the U.S. healthcare system is indisputable.","People can put their capital to work where they like.","Some shareholders believe it is all about price and a few people's pockets.","As a mother of four children, I want to know the drugs I'm giving them are safe. And as an American businesswoman, I want to keep jobs here, and that means making sure foreign drug plants have to meet the same standards as domestic ones.","No one was talking about price decreases, but that does happen in the industry to keep medicine affordable.","I'm running a business.","We are going to continue to run a business, and we are going to continue to meet the supply and demand that's out there.","We recognize the significant burden on patients from continued, rising insurance premiums and being forced increasingly to pay the full list price for medicines at the pharmacy counter.","Patients deserve increased price transparency and affordable care, particularly as the system shifts significant costs to them.","If you put on your business hat, you can't maintain competitiveness by staying at a competitive disadvantage. I mean, you just can't. The odds are just not in your favor.","Obama had the wherewithal to muscle through an entire health care reorganization, right? Like it, don't like it, whatever.","You know what makes me want to cry? I think, whoever the next Facebook is, why would you ever start that company here in the United States?","I hope to be viewed and judged first and foremost by my accomplishments and capabilities as a leader - regardless of my gender.","Being a woman leader is secondary to me - and should be to others.","Women don't necessarily understand that it is possible to have the same level of ambition as men - they allow themselves to be held back by the obstacles rather than empowered by the possibilities.","Starting early in life and in school, we need to ensure women develop the confidence and capabilities to work in a team that will allow them to reach the heights of leadership."],"Heather Brooke":["The hacker community may be small, but it possesses the skills that are driving the global economies of the future.","Public relations is at best promotion or manipulation, at worst evasion and outright deception. What it is never about is a free flow of information.","CCTV is seen either as a symbol of Orwellian dystopia or a technology that will lead to crime-free streets and civil behaviour. While arguments continue, there is very little solid data in the public domain about the costs, quantity and effectiveness of surveillance.","Our printing press is the Internet. Our coffee houses are social networks.","Hackers often describe what they do as playfully creative problem solving.","Leaks are not the problem; they are the symptom. They reveal a disconnect between what people want and need to know and what they actually do know. The greater the secrecy, the more likely a leak.","The monarchy is a part of the state. It exists to serve the people.","Diplomacy has always involved dinners with ruling elites, backroom deals and clandestine meetings. Now, in the digital age, the reports of all those parties and patrician chats can be collected in one enormous database. And once collected in digital form, it becomes very easy for them to be shared.","It seems appropriate that the author of '1984' was a British citizen. George Orwell must have seen how easily the great British public's lamb-like disposition toward its leaders could be exploited to create a police state.","Politicians often claim secrecy is necessary for good governance or national security.","The speed with which WikiLeaks went from niche interest to global prominence was a real-time example of the revolutionizing power of the digital age in which information can spread instantly across the globe through networked individuals.","We are not naughty children, and the state is not our parent.","There are corporate private investigators, companies doing very forensic background checks on people. They buy data, they get their own data... They don't want their industry publicised.","The way the Establishment deals with people like me is to ignore them. When you become unignorable, they will try to smear you, and that's what I feared for a long time. Now I have somehow vaulted into this space where it's difficult for someone to smear me because it would look as though they were being vindictive and spiteful.","Digitization is certainly challenging the old ways of doing things, whether that's in publishing or politics. But it's not the end. In many ways, it is just the beginning.","I'm a freedom of information campaigner, so obviously I support the cause of Wikileaks.","The movement towards radical transparency and accountability has been gaining steam for several decades.","It used to cost money to disclose and distribute information. In the digital age it costs money not to.","Secrecy can be sexy. It's essential to any good mystery novel.","In America, you have the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act. You've got drones now being considered for domestic surveillance. You have the National Security Agency building the world's giantest spy center.","When you're a crime reporter, you see the nub of what life's about, and you don't have much patience for the falsity of politics.","I know people don't like America very much, but the one thing it's very good on is local government.","There's not a self-regulating group of nice fair-playing people in politics. There are a lot of dodgy people in politics.","If any of us were faced with a huge bag of free money and very little accountability, it would be human nature that you would make the most of it.","What the interconnected age in which we live allows us to do is instantly connect with each other.","What the Internet has done is it has decentralised power.","There's a lot of hand-wringing going on about the death of journalism and particularly the death of investigative journalism. What I see is that there is more need than ever to have experienced information processors - people who can look through this mass of data.","The biggest abuses in society happen when people are not able to communicate and not able to connect.","There is a very intense culture of secrecy in Britain that hasn't yet been dismantled. What passes for transparency here would serve any secret society well.","People are used to getting a lot of information quickly, and they're used to being quite empowered as consumers, and they go to governments expecting a similar treatment; they want to find data and they want to influence events quickly, and yet they come into this brick wall.","The values of WikiLeaks have been completely overshadowed by Julian Assange.","If you really believe in a cause, let the cause speak for itself. And if you, by your personality, are damaging that cause, if you really believe in it, you step aside.","It is scrutiny by the general public that keeps the powerful honest.","I never thought I would get married. I didn't think I was that type of person.","I like to write books and cause trouble.","Whether I'll get the chance to write fiction, I don't know. I could do political conspiracy thrillers, couldn't I? With an investigative journalist as the heroine.","Newspapers are not free and they never have been. They can appear to be so, but someone, somewhere is covering the costs whether that is through advertising, a patron's largesse or a license fee. Advertising is no longer subsidising the industry and so the cost must fall somewhere - why not on the people who use it?","I've written for 'The Times' because they have valued what I do enough to pay me. The 'New Statesman' magazine also asked me to write an article, but they didn't want to pay me anything. To me, that shows how much they value quality journalism.","If you don't think there is any value in the work I, or any other serious journalists do, then don't spend your money on it. At least you have the choice.","I've always worked on the fringe of the British press establishment, carving out this niche for myself.","When I came to Britain I was in awe of the British press, afraid of them. But they're not as ferocious as people think. In some instances they are, but when it comes to taking on power they're really deferential.","In Britain, it's bred into you, the idea that you can't really change anything, so why bother. When I went to school in America, it was the total opposite view - you, as an individual, can change anything and everything. It's how you're raised.","There's a temptation not to vote at all as a protest, but it's definitely not a protest. In fact, all it does is keep the people in power in power, and I don't think they should be.","I pine for a return to the type of old-school journalism and the tough newspapermen and women of the Thirties.","My parents are British but they emigrated to America, where I was born.","Parliamentarians certainly know how to do bad public relations.","Britain's legal structure is basically the same as in feudal times: laws are written for the elite.","When I was 26 or 27, I gave up journalism. I came to England after my mom died, to let serendipity take its course. And I just found myself back in journalism again.","I'm very optimistic, but I'm optimistic about individuals, not institutions.","As the news agenda goes into warp speed, it becomes ever more difficult for authors writing about current events to keep their books timely and relevant.","Traditional publishers require an author to submit a manuscript six months in advance, and if pressed, no later than two or three.","Slightly embarrassing admission: Even when I was a kid, I used to have these little spy books, and I would, like, see what everybody was doing in my neighborhood and log it down.","I trained as a journalist in America where paying sources is frowned upon. Now I work in the U.K. where there is a more flexible attitude.","You can't hope for a better result as a campaigner than to have the prime minister announce a major policy change within 48 hours of your documentary.","There is risk everywhere. Being alive carries the risk of death.","A lot of people have a lot to gain from peddling scare stories about cyber 'warfare.'","In whose interest is it to hype up the collapse of the Internet from a DDoS attack? Why, the people who provide cyber security services, of course.","In the soil of ignorance, fear can easily be sown.","A lack of government oversight hasn't hindered the Internet. Quite the opposite. A hands-off approach is largely responsible for its fantastic growth and success.","We need to codify our values and build consensus around what we want from a free society and a free Internet. We need to put into law protections for our privacy and our right to speak and assemble.","A generation of people are being radicalised by the criminalisation of information sharing.","We pay a lot for our court service, but it's not enough. Courts are under-resourced, which leads to delayed justice - particularly in criminal courts.","If the public can't see justice being done, or afford the costs of justice, then the entire system becomes little more than a cozy club solely for the benefit of judges, lawyers and their lackeys, a sort of care in the community for the upper middle classes.","Unwarranted search and seizure by the government officials was unacceptable to the American revolutionaries. Shouldn't it be unacceptable in the digital age, too?","Hackerspaces are the digital-age equivalent of English Enlightenment coffee houses. They are places open to all, indifferent to social status, and where ideas and knowledge hold primary value.","If Anonymous and Lulzsec are the id of hacking, then physical hackerspaces are the heart of the higher-minded hacking ideals: freedom of information, meritocracy of ideas, a joy of learning and anti-authoritarianism.","Democracy isn't just for people in the Middle East, but Britons, too.","Many of us are under the delusion that the police exist solely to deal with crime and keep us safe. That is to ignore the major focus of many of today's top cops on managing reputation - both of their force and, by default, their careers.","When journalism is treated as just another widget in a commercial enterprise, the focus isn't on truth, verification or public good, but productivity and output.","The royal family are protected from public accountability by law.","It is quite surreal having a film made about your life. The whole process of turning real life into drama is interesting in itself, but even more so when it is your own life being put into the narrative forge.","When it comes to reforming MPs' expenses, the answer is simply to keep it simple: show us receipts as they're claimed and, where there are abuses, enforce the law.","You don't make a system more effective by increasing the number of regulators.","For information to be useful, it should be dynamic, searchable, and accessible.","Say what you will about Americans, but one thing they are not is passive. The Bush administration may have pushed through the Patriot Act weeks after 11 September, but, as the American public got to grips with how the law was affecting their individual rights, their protests grew loud and angry."],"Heather Burns":["I don't like to drive. I don't like the aggressiveness that goes along with driving.","I'm not cutthroat. I'm Midwestern.","I'm lucky. I've worked with extremely talented women who won't sacrifice comedy to make themselves look better.","We've all been affected by divorce in one way or another, whether we've experienced it personally, or witnessed family or friends go through it."],"Heather Doerksen":["I typically do yoga and I walk everywhere, and that's how I get my exercise.","I really like to do comedy, and I did comedy the first 2 years after I graduated college, so I really love it and appreciate it.","I do like reality TV. I've always liked 'Survivor' since season 1.","I used to write on my resume that I was shorter than I was because I thought it would inhibit my roles, and as soon as I embraced that I am a tall female, I started getting really fantastic roles and really didn't even worry about wearing heels."],"Heather Donahue":["I am the shortest and least funny person in my family.","I get sidetracked very easily.","All this technology for connection and what we really only know more about is how anonymous we are in the grand scheme of things.","I find that a lot of women respond to my work in that it doesn't make them feel bad about themselves.","If we had been less reliant on technology and the security that we enjoy in being divorced from what we used to know, maybe things would have turned out differently.","In LA, I mean, here's this place full of desperate and sad people who take their only pleasure from destroying others for the purposes of their own self-aggrandizement.","We're not all nice, and there are a lot of levels of ambition and niceness.","I'm not the beautiful one.","A lot of our entertainment throws into detail the stagnation and illness of how we live today-it's sad and it's sick... and it's profitable.","I've heard people say that 'The Blair Witch Project' is a feminist movie because there's a woman in charge and I've heard it called a completely anti-feminist movie because this woman screws everything up. Who cares really? It's just a movie.","I could read at a very early age and I loved stories, losing myself in stories, novels.","Acting is just something I always knew I wanted to do - acting and writing.","I'm trying to drink more water.","Ideally, I'm also sending a message that everything passes, even hope, and sometimes you have to be patient while you wait for it to come back around again.","I think I'm just more adaptable now, so danger, overall, seems less dangerous to me.","I don't know anyone who ever got deferred pay. I'm the first of my friends to ever actually get a deferred paycheck."],"Heather Dubrow":["To hide behind a computer and an anonymous persona to spew hate at another person is despicable.","I love seeing my husband having success.","Truth is stranger than fiction, which is why reality TV is so popular.","I do regret that when I went to college, I didn't have a liberal arts education. I got a BFA in musical theater, so it was a very directed toward what I was doing. I wish that I had expanded my horizons a little bit.","I have to say, I'm sort of always obsessed with Norah Jones. I just love her voice, but I don't really have an album - I have a playlist.","I like 'Glee' because I love all the singing. It's like an hour-long music video. Those kids are so talented, and I love 'The Glee Project'.","I think life is what you live every day, and it just keeps coming at you. You never know what it's going to be.","I do think the secret to a good marriage is separate bathrooms.","Because I am married to a surgeon, I do Botox and I do some fillers. But I truly believe that the best beauty secret is happiness. I know that sounds sappy, but I'm just telling you it comes from the inside and spreads out. The happier and more satisfied you are living your life, the better you will look.","It's very easy to listen to one comment and make a snap judgment.","I do like nice things; we do live in a great house, but I don't choose my friends by how much money they have or what labels they're wearing.","From a very young age, I was singing and acting and performing for my family.","I always knew I wanted to be a performer."],"Heather Graham Pozzessere":["I can always track my career by the children - I started writing right after the 14-year-old was born, and sold my first book just in time to pay for the birth of the 12-year-old.","I think people underestimate the romance audience. It's everything from career women to high school girls to elderly women. I have male readers, too, especially for the Civil War books.","With historicals, the research is half the fun. Contemporaries are especially easy. People are right out there in front of you; you meet them every day. You can concentrate wholly on the story and characters.","I always feel a responsibility to the people I write about. I feel obligated to portray them in the way they feel is proper."],"Heather Graham":["There's always a side of me that goes, 'I'm just a nerd.' I never look at myself and say, 'I'm beautiful.' Like anyone else, I see the flaws. Guys don't do that as much as women. But you have to learn to appreciate and accept and love yourself as you are.","I am intrigued by different religions and respect them all, but to be honest, I feel the most spiritual when I am doing yoga or looking at an ocean. Being spiritual is feeling a connection with a higher power and knowing that life is about more than just achieving goals. It is about feeling good in the moment.","I always wanted to be the pretty girl, but I thought I wasn't. When I started acting and getting pretty girl roles, I felt like I was just pretending, and nobody saw I was just this big nerd.","I sleep as much as I want. I'll sleep, like, 11 hours, unless I'm working. Sometimes I do feel like, 'This is weird; I should just get up so I can fit into the world.' Then I'm like, 'Why?' I don't have a nine-to-five job.","Whenever I meet people who seem really sweet and unassuming, I kind of wonder about them.","I'd like to think I could do something great - a performance like Meryl Streep's in 'Sophie's Choice' - at some point in my life. At the same time, though, I don't want to put too much pressure on myself to be great.","I'd have made a terrible nun.","I'm a good Catholic girl in the way that Madonna is. In the sense that I'm not that good at all.","I practice transcendental meditation and there is a phase where you're meant to lift off the ground.","I want to be able to fly like a superhero. I won't be happy until I can fly across oceans and cities, saving people from being murdered.","I watched movies and thought, 'I want to be in movies,' and wanted to be an actor.","I don't need to try so hard to be someone else.","I guess you just feel like there's a whole story that's not being told in movies. You're only seeing the macho guy version of a story that from the woman's side, may be completely different.","There are less opportunities for women.","Gosh, it's so fun to do a movie where there's nothing dark happening in it.","I just try to take the best opportunities that I can get.","I wish that there were more female driven films, female-centric films being made.","There's not a lot of stories for women told by women in a very real, true voice.","It's good to be able to be a leading lady, to be a romantic lead, to play opposite people who are talented, and charismatic and stuff.","I think it might be nice to date someone not in the business.","To be honest, I feel like I think too much. So I like working out because it makes me kind of relax.","I like doing yoga. I do yoga three times a week and I do Pilates twice.","I think if you're an actor you kind of have to be willing to look stupid.","I think you have to be honest and not try to be somebody that you really aren't.","I try to get 11 or 12 hours of sleep a night. It sounds excessive but that's really what I need.","I work out a lot and I do yoga and I do Pilates and I'm kind of athletic. I've taken dance classes, but at the same point I'm just a total klutz.","I admire those people who hold on to their elegance in old age but I'd rather have fun.","The ultimate fun is doing nothing. I like doing nothing with people I like - maybe just eating, hanging out and talking.","It would be nice if I did have a good relationship with my family, and yes, part of me longs to have a mum and dad who love and accept me for who I am. But if they never do, it's OK.","I've learnt to take care of myself.","I basically think that I'm a fairly nice, normal person with just a few eccentricities.","The funny thing is, I look at these magazines that make me so insecure and neurotic, but I'm in them!","I'm not the kind of person who needs to be a mother no matter what. Life brings you people. Maybe I'll nurture someone who's not my child, like a friend, or an actor I'm working with who needs some love.","As a kid, I read 'Peter Pan,' and I really wanted to be him.","I used to dress up in my mom's old clothes and play with these kids from the neighbourhood and make up stories: I would pretend that we were all vampires.","I am a bit of a Valley girl, so I say 'you know' and 'like' too much.","Once a week, I spend a day luxuriating in bed. I like staying in my house, pottering around, and maybe cooking or just laying around reading. I love doing yoga and transcendental meditation.","I'm not actually a mom in real life, so it's fun to pretend to be one. I like to approach things the same in art as in life. You can choose to look on the positive side and enjoy whatever roles you're given. You can find the silver lining in anything.","I do have the roller skates from 'Boogie Nights.'","I remember when we were shooting 'Boogie Nights,' all of my stand-ins were wiping out all the time. I'd practice before I got to the set, but they'd just show up and put on the roller-skates, and they'd be skating over these wires and cables, so they would all fall over. It was totally dangerous.","I took karate classes for a few years. Taekwondo. I'd love to do a movie role where I could do some karate.","I was taught to be demure, so it was harder for me to learn how to stand up for myself and go, 'What do I want? What are my desires?'","I'd rather be happily single than unhappily married.","When you're playing a character, I think it's always better not to judge that character.","In my own life, I've written scripts that I want to direct, so I would love to take my own creativity in a way where I could tell my own story. That does inspire me, the idea of becoming a director.","Yeah, 'Feed the Dog' is just a really fun, teenage movie with Nat Wolff and Selena Gomez and all these other great people. It's just so silly-funny, and my character's super-fun.","A man can be 43, and people will say, 'Oh, he's a cool bachelor, and he just hasn't settled down,' but with a woman, it's, 'Oh, she must have really wanted to get married, but she didn't.' I honestly think that attitude is a little bit sexist.","I like the idea of a family, but I don't know that I'd like to be a single mum.","I definitely like not working sometimes. It's so fun. I just love sleeping in. In America, everyone is driven to succeed and wake up and do something. But I don't care. I want to sleep in. I want to relax. I don't want to have to get up every day.","I've been evaluating how much I value happiness in my life. To be too driven takes away your happiness.","I think Korean barbecue is very accessible to Americans because it's sort of similar to something we know, but with different flavours.","I'd rather look old than look as if I'd had plastic surgery. Sometimes it looks really fake; all people can think about when they look at you is that you've had plastic surgery.","I'm a big fan of moisturisers. Sometimes I'll just buy a night-time nourishing cream from The Body Shop, and sometimes I'll splurge on Creme de la Mer. I also love the Alba Botanica range.","I like clothes that make me feel good. My favourite designers include Michelle Jonas and Dolce & Gabbana. Their clothes make me feel as if I'm Sophia Loren - really womanly.","I think the Olsen twins' line, The Row, has some cool stuff. And I'm kind of obsessed with a clothing line called Stop Staring. It has a lot of vintage-type dresses that are retro '40s and '50s inspired."],"Heather Langenkamp":["One of the annoying things when you're in a movie is that gets talked about is everyone projects meaning onto everyone's intentions.","I totally love being on camera.","I was fortunate enough to have my kids early, so being a mom always ended up being a better gig than these other parts that came along. So I always justified not really working a lot because I had a family.","I'm always concerned that I'm insulting the elder statesmen on the set by my crass behavior.","You can never empathize with your parents as a teenager. You just think they're just on another planet.","I love those shows where they go to all the greasy diners in America.","I'm such a Goody Two-shoes, but I get a vicarious thrill at someone sticking it to the Man.","I do wish I'd had a better career. Who wouldn't?","My husband and Charlie Sheen played Little League together. They've always been best friends.","The organization that it takes to make a movie like 'Star Trek' is amazing, intimidating and fascinating.","Point a light at me, and I'll start tap dancing.","When I decided to become an actress, I think I let some people down. It was a kind of rebellion."],"Heather Locklear":["The older you get, the farther from the camera you need to be.","You can't keep changing men, so you settle for changing your lipstick.","Sex appeal is not on purpose.","When I look in the mirror I see the girl I was when I was growing up, with braces, crooked teeth, a baby face and a skinny body.","There are times when I feel lazy and just want to stay in bed all day, but I know that working out is the best way to get those endorphins going, which will make me feel better emotionally and physically.","I think I've always been good so God wouldn't strike me dead.","First of all, I would like to clear the air on one thing. Alison has slept with more men than Amanda; Sydney has slept with more men than Amanda; I think Matt has slept with more men than Amanda.","Anybody can say she's an actress. It's another thing to get a job.","With a parent, it's always guilt. You want to be there, but you kind of also want to be here.","One man is not enough.","You have to be very careful with women friends.","You just have to forgive them for being men.","I don't date rock 'n' rollers. I just marry them.","You can't help but be scrutinized, so I might as well be doing something while I'm being scrutinized.","Playing bad is always more fun than playing good.","I don't date. The thought of that is so yuck.","I don't know how Hollywood sees me.","I'd like roles with more depth."],"Heather Matarazzo":["There is going to be a hundred thousand doors slammed in your face before one opens, so feel ok about taking rejection.","There's another girl who was going to play Hilary Faye and luckily she wound up not doing it.","It's good to get out of the closet and talk about it and find out other people's views.","I think it magnified it. For me, I wasn't sheltered so I think it was magnified. Especially when you're a teenager and you go to high school and you're in the business and you are known.","But especially if you have the wrong people within your circle. Truthfully, at the end of the day, no one cares about you in this business whether they are your agent or your manager or your publicist.","I seek out good work.","I feel that I've been very fortunate in the films that I have gotten and that I've chosen to do.","So the characters that I choose, I like to make sure that they have depth and that they have some sort of bite. It's more fun.","I just have a belief that when there is a rare script out there that speaks to you, you have to stick with it. You have to.","I'm 100 percent Irish by birth, grew up Italian, and yet I constantly get cast as playing Jewish.","I will say that my personal business is my personal business. And I will leave it at that.","If I was just considered a looker and wasn't considered an actor, where would I be in 10 or 20 years from now?","I smile so much at the theater my face hurts when I leave.","It doesn't matter if a critic pans or praises my movies, I am only concerned about that one audience member and what their experience is.","I did get bullied and I did get picked on and I did have that feeling in my gut of being incredibly self-conscious. I naturally gravitated towards my elders because I didn't know how to speak or be present with my peers.","They don't teach you just how to be in school. There's no class on that. There's no multiple choice test for Why Do I Feel This Way?","The minute I ever start thinking about what a character would do is the minute I bring my ego into play. It's the minute I'm putting a judgment on something.","My eyes and spirit have opened up since I found someone that I get to share my life with.","I would love to do a musical so hopefully I will be blessed with doing one.","I don't really prepare for roles. I just kind of do them!","It doesn't matter what medium I perform, I just love to perform in general, if it's good work.","Honestly, there was a time after I came out that I really did not think I would be working again.","I've been given so much, and if I can just give back a tenth of what I've been given, then it's all worth it."],"Heather Mills":["Eighty per cent of global warming comes from livestock and deforestation.","I fell in love for the right reason. I fell in love unconditionally.","What I've been developing is a vegan fast food chain and vegan food markets.","I have had so much public support.","People love me or hate me and all I think about is the people that I know and suffer with different causes and carry on my charity work and that's what keeps me alive really.","Why are we so obsessed with celebrity culture? We have front-page news about divorces instead of front-page news about global warming, about women being abused, about children being abused. We're going on a downward spiral.","I'm a good mother. I'm a good person.","It's very important with an artificial leg that all high heels are exactly the same height.","I could get into bed with James Bond, then take my false leg off and it would really be a gun.","It took one human error to take my leg and one human error to take my mother's.","There have been loads of times I have regretted meeting Paul because I was so happy in my old life.","The overcoming of adversity and, ultimately, denying it the rite of passage, has been a constant and perpetual motive throughout my life.","If you wear short skirts you get your femininity back.","I'm a very cheap date.","I can't leave England.","There are many other kinds of milk available. Why don't we try drinking rats' milk and dogs' milk?","To have an opinion about somebody you've never met before is pretty superficial.","I am a charity campaigner.","I'm not telling people to go vegan overnight.","Around 80 per cent of my money goes to charity.","I made my million before I was 19!","I got a fascination with food.","I've always gone out with men who wanted a cook all the time.","I've had, you know, my leg chopped off.","I don't mind my age.","I'm always happy.","I mean, I eat really healthily.","The hardest thing for me is walking. Can you imagine you've got a metal pole and if you put pressure on it like a strong walk, you can walk.","I've done sport for a long time.","I have a very basic leg. But it has a silicon cover on it. I have a flat foot leg, a high heel leg and then I have a leg which, in the winter, I have to ski in and in the summer I swap it into my roller blades.","Everyone knows that when you go through a divorce, it's a really difficult time for both parties and you've all - you believe, you both believe, individually, that you've put your best into it.","My personal view is that until there is a disincentive to write lies and abusive comments it's going to continue.","I don't mean to be accident prone, but my excuse is if you really want to get somewhere you have to go full gas.","Luckily I'm a quick healer.","I was hospitalized five times in 2011 because of my skiing. Fracturing my left shoulder twice, snapping my anterior cruciate ligament once and smashing my scapula into five pieces.","Nobody is on the Paralympic Team until three months before those games.","Having loved sport my whole life, competing in a Paralympics would be a dream come true.","I just have friends that don't sell their pictures to newspapers.","I told my whole life story in my book.","I never used the press for anything except my charity.","The police came to me to say I had death threats and that I had to be careful!","I'm not perfect.","I have to clear my name.","I fell in love with a man, not a Beatle.","If I was a gold-digger, I would have a lot of money in my bank account. I'd be worth millions and millions.","I love to dance in the disco, but that's about it.","I was quiet for a year but I had 4,000 articles written about me.","In England, people don't like me.","I love England but everything that has happened makes me realise that I would be better off in the States.","I have a box of evidence that's going to a certain person should anything happen to me, so if you top me off, it's still going to that person, and the truth will come out.","There is a huge agenda behind trying to destroy me and put me down.","What did the paparazzi do to Diana? They chased her and they killed her."],"Heather Morris":["I love looking in the mirror and feeling good about what I see.","I love to wear red lipstick a lot, even in the daytime.","I'm pretty gutsy. Dancers don't think about things; they just do them.","Beyonce was just always full-out. She's like a beast. So you learn that no matter how you feel, just do it. Just like Nike: 'Just Do It.'","I put on lip balm first thing in the morning and always use it before I swipe on my red lipstick.","Me and my roommate wrote and directed a little short comedy called 'The Elevator.'","You don't want to be too cool. But you don't want to be too dorky. Still, I find it so much better to see a guy at a club being a dork, and having fun, than trying to be sexy.","I am thrilled FLIRT! tapped into me to be their new Style Ambassador. I love FLIRT! products because they help me express my own personal style - especially when I want to stand out on set or in the crowd. What could be more fun than getting to play with makeup and fragrance and tell people all about it!","I guess because I'm so young, I m not sure of what lies ahead for me. I'm more into going the route of producing and directing. I just made a little short film. I'm more excited about going the route of doing a Drew Barrymore or... what's the one from 'Star Wars?'","I had a serious boyfriend in high school, but we would take breaks in between. You shouldn't always have a boyfriend!","I go through different phases and change my mind about my style all the time. In the winter, I wanted to wear jeans and pumps and black and leather all the time. Right now, I want to wear long skirts and belts, with my hair in a ponytail. It changes all the time!","There were ten dancers - four guys and six girls - including me, on the Beyonce tour. Sometimes we would go out with her, to events. She was really normal - just like everybody else!","Dancing was my sport when I was younger. So I chose that over everything. And then, I just had to keep going because it became a competitive thing. But I'm not trying to impress anyone anymore. Dancing is more like my art, now.","I want to make everybody laugh.","I try to eat how your mother wanted you to eat when you were young.","Implants were something I thought I wanted when I was younger, and now I don't. It was hard being active with them, because my chest was always sore. It hurt a lot, and I didn't like always being in pain, so they had to go!","My dad passed away before my freshman year, and it altered how I thought. I was depressed - I didn't hang out with my friends. I worked through it by dancing.","I've wanted to perform my entire life. I found a paper I wrote in kindergarten class about what I wanted to be when I grew up - and I wrote 'a famous singer!'","Flirt!'s mascara is insane - I don't need false lashes when I wear it.","Like most dancers, I love lip stains! We hate gloss because hair gets stuck in it.","The simplest way to do something cool is the cross-turn. Like in the '80s - Michael Jackson did it. You jump and cross your legs together at the same time, and then spin out of it. That's it.","You know what's really hot? Pop-and-locking, ticking. The moonwalk. Tricks like that.","I carry one black mascara and one brown.","I can't live without my dark plum eyeliner. I use liquid because it's easier on my eyes."],"Heather O'Neill":["Adolescents are attracted to tragic heroes. That's why rock stars dress like homeless people. Adolescence is a fall. It's when every child becomes an orphan.","A lot of children grow up in poverty with flawed parents, but their inner world is still as inherently filled with wonder and innocence as children who are kept away from the city's underbelly.","Adolescents are still children in that they can't yet tell the difference between make believe and fiction.","I had a ludicrous childhood, but I feel that I was able to profit from a lot of the idiotic and unfortunate things that happened to me by turning them into fiction.","All writers have the idea that they are famous.","Many writers were picked on as children. Why? Because they were weird from the get-go. They were often to be found at the back of the class smelling erasers, or talking to caterpillars, or walking down the street with an encyclopedia balanced on their head."],"Heather O'Reilly":["I think that a lot of players and a lot of teams don't think of contact lenses as being a part of that essential gear but it truly is. You want every competitive advantage you can find and obviously having great vision is one of those advantages.","Coaches will eventually notice a great attitude, and they respect that.","You can't let the highs get too high and you can't let the lows get too low.","At least for soccer players, it comes down to a blend of two types of fitness - your base endurance, which comes from longer distance running, and your speed, which comes from sprint-based workouts.","I keep a journal, and every day I write down one great play that I had that day. I don't write down any negatives.","After getting glasses and contacts it was kind of a wow moment that I could definitely see better and on the soccer field it really helped me.","It's always interesting to be playing against some of my best friends and some of my longtime teammates. You get to see them before the game and after the game and it's always nice to catch up but when the whistle blows it's sort of all business on the field.","In the very beginning whenever Mia Hamm or Brandi Chastain would call for the ball, I'd just give it to them immediately because it was them and I was nervous.","You can only control what you can control.","I've won some pretty cool things in my life and I have a lot of great titles.","Our journey has taken 21 players but our goal is still the same, to win the World Cup."],"Heather O'Rourke":["I did a picture for the First Barbie doll box.","They used a doll when I fall through the ceiling.","I have a St. Bernard named B.","I pretend something scary is in front of me.","I read mysteries like Nancy Drew and Alfred Hitchcock, and I swim and I ride my motorbike.","Math - it's not my best subject.","My Panasonic typewriter can make graphs. It types in four different colors.","My parents put everything in a trust fund for me. I won't get it until I'm 18, so I'll use it for college.","The beast is not dead."],"Heather Watson":["Wins and losses just blur into one as you move around the world playing matches.","If you don't feel hunger, you don't succeed at anything.","With tennis, no one's going to give it to you. You have to be determined.","I did everything - swimming, dancing, and badminton as well as tennis. It was always tennis that I really loved, though.","I've learned that I can compete at the top level.","I'm working on staying aggressive in my game and fixing all the little details.","I'm trying to be a complete player and have every shot in the game.","You don't just have to be skilled and talented at tennis, but you have to be so physically strong.","At the end of the day, it's just a tennis match. It's not the end of the world.","I just need to improve.","Winning titles is a big thing for me.","I know lots of people who climb very high in the rankings without winning a single title.","That winning feeling, it's great.","I think I'm realising that careers for tennis players are very short. On the women's side now, players are starting to peak later on, but the average age is about 31, 32 when you finish playing, so I want to make the most of it while I'm young, fit, and healthy. I don't want to waste any time.","There's always going to be people saying stuff.","I've learnt I can compete with the best in the world.","Even with not having that many matches under my belt, I handled the match against Svitolina well. When I was younger, not having that many matches under my belt, I might not have done that.","For me, Wimbledon is such a special tournament. I feel at home when I play there, and the grass is perfect.","Everybody believes they can win now. That's why there are so many upsets in the Grand Slams.","Every draw's a tough draw.","In the men's game, there are three, four, five dominant players who pretty much win everything, but in the women's, anyone can.","People ranked No. 80 or No. 90 in the world are tough to play."],"Heather Watts":["Arts education is a big part of building a 21st century creative mind, and I think that we have let way too many kids lose their way by not drawing in their young minds with music, dance, painting and the other various ways we can express those things we do not have words for.","Misty Copeland is making history. During American Ballet Theatre's current season at the Metropolitan Opera House, Copeland will alight on that storied Lincoln Center stage, making her New York debut as the Swan Queen in the iconic masterpiece Swan Lake - a crowning achievement for any dancer, regardless of the color of her skin.","I believe strongly in the power of arts education to engage and empower young people.","With her grace and grit, and the will to lead change, Misty Copeland is truly a ballerina for our time.","There are nights when you are lucky enough to tap into something about yourself that you are unaware of and can't possibly control, and somehow, at that moment, other people can view it or sense it or feel it.","I need to live in new shoes and not be a dancer.","I don't want to be one of those people who have the best part of their life be 'back when.'","In 2007, when my husband Damian Woetzel took on the artistic direction at the Vail Valley International Dance Festival, we both felt it was important to offer the entire Vail community access to dance.","I have always believed that those that have been given a lot need to share in all areas of life."],"Heather Wilson":["The H-1B visa program which helps sustain our rapidly growing economy and also helps meet the health care needs of families living in rural New Mexico.","The poll that matters is the one that happens on Election Day.","Children tease each other because you're short or you're tall or you're a redhead or because you're ugly or because you're smart or because you're dumb or all kinds of differences and as parents we have to deal with that and strengthen our children to be comfortable with themselves and also to show empathy and acceptance towards others.","I became a Republican because I trust people more than I trust government.","Many of our young people spend four years getting very expensive college degrees. But our universities fail them and the nation if they continue to graduate students with expertise in biochemistry, mathematics or history without teaching them to think about what problems are important and why.","We need a balanced, long term energy policy to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and preserve the beauty of the land we love.","A comprehensive national energy policy is critical to our nation's economy and our national security. Energy expenditures account for about 7% percent of our total economy and influence pricing in the much of the rest of the economy.","If New Mexican voters believe the path to create American jobs is keeping taxes low, then they have an option. That's my campaign.","I've got a bit of an independent streak. I'm not afraid of bipartisan compromise on issues that are important to the nation.","Primaries are a family fight. I'm a pro-free enterprise, pro-Second Amendment, pro-life Republican.","After Vietnam, the Democrats became fundamentally the anti-military as a party.","Unlike many graduate fellowships, the Rhodes seeks leaders who will 'fight the world's fight.' They must be more than mere bookworms. We are looking for students who wonder, students who are reading widely, students of passion who are driven to make a difference in the lives of those around them and in the broader world.","I support legal immigration. I don't support amnesty because it is not fair to people standing in line at consulates around the world.","New Mexico has been, in the past, a swing state.","When you increase the cost of energy, jobs go elsewhere.","I support legal immigration.","Border security is a safety issue.","New Mexico is one of the top energy-producing states in the nation.","I am considering running for Senate, as well as other opportunities."],"Heavy D":["His name is Michael Jackson, not Super Michael Jackson. He makes mistakes just like all of us.","I started young. My first record came out when I was - what? 18? So I was in the studio when I was 15, 16.","The hardest thing for an artist to do is to let go. I don't wanna be the dude - if you come to my house, there are no pictures circa '86 in my house.","I'm not one of those pop guys. That's for wimps like Vanilla Ice.","Reggae was always a passion of mine. I used to say in interviews that I would love to do a reggae album. But it consumed my life being a hip-hop artist and being Heavy D, which I'm happy and proud of.","There's something about being any kind of entertainer that is acting. You have to put on a show. Things you wouldn't do in your life, you do on stage. You have to let go. And that's extra hard for rappers. We have a tendency to, quote unquote, keep it real. As an actor, you have to be able to humiliate yourself. Do whatever it takes.","I was in California the first time I heard Michael Jackson wanted to record with me. I was, like, 'Nah, no way, he's too big, it can't be true.' Then I got a call from Michael's people at my hotel telling me he was interested. But I still wasn't believing it - I thought they were setting me up for a TV practical jokes show.","As an artist, there were different levels in my career that brought me to a realization that I am what you would call a pure artist. And I don't say that with any type of vanity.","I aim my music at the hip black hip-hop audience."],"Heber J. Grant":["If there is any one thing that will bring peace and contentment into the human heart, and into the family, it is to live within our means.","The power of the living God is here on the earth. The Priesthood is here.","Day-dreams without work do not amount to anything; it is the actual work that counts.","When one is giving service for the advancement of humanity, when one is working without money and without price, with no hope of earthly reward, there comes a real, genuine joy into the human heart.","Being an only child, my mother reared me very carefully.","When I was about twenty-five years of age, Professor Sims informed me that I could sing, but added, 'I would like to be at least forty miles away while you are doing it.'","What the world needs today more than anything else is an implicit faith in God, our Father, and in Jesus Christ, His Son, as the Redeemer of the world.","Every living soul among the Latter-day Saints that fasts two meals once a month will be benefited spiritually and be built up in the faith of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ - benefited spiritually in a wonderful way - and sufficient means will be in the hands of the bishops to take care of all the poor.","If we are striving, if we are working, if we are trying, to the best of our ability, to improve day by day, then we are in the line of our duty.","When I was about forty-three years of age, I had a private secretary with a beautiful baritone voice. I told him I would give anything in the world if I could only carry a tune. He laughed and said, 'Anybody who has a voice and perseverance can sing.'","I consider it one of the greatest accomplishments of my life that I have learned to sing.","If you have ambitions, dream of what you wish to accomplish, and then put your shoulder to the wheel and work.","With the help of the Lord, I will do the best I can, and... with His help, I have no fear at all but what I can get along.","To my mind, the main reason for the Depression in the United States as a whole, is the bondage of debt and the spirit of speculation among the people.","Thank the Lord for a mother who was a general as well as a Latter-day Saint; who realized that it was a remarkable and splendid thing to encourage a boy to do something besides perhaps milking cows if he was on a farm, if he had ambitions along athletic lines.","My mother tried to teach me when I was a small child to sing but failed because of my inability to carry a tune.","I know of nothing that brings greater joy to the human heart than laboring at home or abroad for the salvation of the souls of men. I know of nothing which gives us a greater love of all that is good, than teaching this Gospel of Jesus Christ.","I am always pleased when I have the opportunity of meeting with the Latter-day Saints in any of their gatherings.","There stand out in my life many incidents in my youth, of wonderful inspiration and power through men preaching the gospel in the spirit of testimony and prayer.","It is a remarkable fact that we can never read or hear of the labors which our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ performed, without taking pleasure in it, while, on the other hand, there is nothing so interesting in the life and history of any other individual but what by hearing or reading it time and time again we become tired of it.","I appeal to the Latter-day Saints to be honest with the Lord, and I promise them that peace, prosperity and financial success will attend those who are honest with our Heavenly Father.","When we set our hearts upon the things of this world and fail to be strictly honest with the Lord, we do not grow in the light and power and strength of the gospel as we otherwise would do.","If you and I desire the blessings of life, of health, of vigor of body and mind; if we desire the destroying angel to pass us by, as he did in the days of the children of Israel, we must obey the Word of Wisdom; then God is bound, and the blessing shall come to us.","I ask every man and woman occupying a place of responsibility whose duty it is to teach the gospel of Jesus Christ to live it and keep the commandments of God, so that their example will teach it.","There is no better example of an older brother's love than that exhibited in the life of Hyrum Smith for the Prophet Joseph Smith.","There never was one particle of... jealousy... in the heart of Hyrum Smith.","My most earnest prayer is that every man and every woman will get it into his or her heart that they are in very deed the architects of their lives.","There is no labor in which we engage but that there is a spirit telling us, 'Oh, you do not need to do that; it is a waste of time, and you ought to be engaged in something else.'","Prosperity comes to those who observe the law of tithing.","What I count as real prosperity... is the growth in a knowledge of God, and in a testimony, and in the power to live the gospel and to inspire our families to do the same. That is prosperity of the truest kind.","I know that Lorenzo Snow was God's mouthpiece upon the earth, that he was the representative of the Lord, and that he was, in very deed, a prophet of God.","Many men say: 'If I could only see an angel, if I could only hear an angel proclaim something, that would cause me to be faithful all the days of my life!'","I am free to confess that I am disappointed with the Yosemite valley. It seems only about one-half as grand as the American Fork canyon.","The Book of Mormon is in absolute harmony from start to finish with other sacred scriptures. There is not a doctrine taught in it that does not harmonize with the teachings of Jesus Christ.","My wife Lucy was very sick for nearly three years prior to her death. At one time, I was in the hospital with her for six months.","As a man grows and increases in the things of this world, if he is not careful, he will lose the Spirit of the Lord, and he will set his heart upon the things of this world.","Every individual can improve from day to day, from year to year, and have greater capacity to do things as the years come and the years go.","When I joined a baseball club, the boys of my own age, and a little older, played in the first nine, those younger than myself played in the second, and those still younger in the third, and I played with them.","When I first began to learn to sing, it took me from three to four months to learn two simple hymns.","I have, all the days of my life, enjoyed singing very much.","When I was a child, next to my own mother, no woman that ever lived took as much interest in me, gave me as much motherly advice or seemed to love me more than did Sister Snow. I loved her with all my heart, and loved her hymn, 'O My Father.'","When I first began to learn to sing... I would get off on nearly every line and did not know it. I have learned to know when I am off.","Let every man feel that he is the architect and builder of his own life, and that he proposes to make a success of it by working.","Let every Latter-day Saint give value received for everything he gets, whether it be in work, or whatever he does.","I have no animosity against any living soul.","I, of course, owe everything to my mother, because my father died when I was only nine days of age; and the marvelous teachings, the faith, the integrity of my mother have been an inspiration to me.","There is no such thing as standing still.","I value all things as nothing in comparison with having the spirit of God to guide me.","I have felt the inspiration of the living God directing me in my labors.","I don't care if every patriarch in the Church has made a mistake in a blessing, and told a lie, I believe with all my heart and soul that the gospel is true, and I will not allow my faith to be upset.","A Mormon knows that the promises of God are true, and He said that all will be tried; realizing these things the Latter-day Saints will acknowledge their Maker not only in blessings but also in tribulations.","I have reached out my hand, I have plucked the fruits of the Gospel, I have eaten of them, and they are sweet, yea, above all that is sweet.","Not only did Jesus come as a universal gift, He came as an individual offering with a personal message to each one of us.","As a boy, without experience, never having spoken in public in my life, for any length of time, never ten minutes at once, I was called to preside over a stake of Zion."],"Hector Berlioz":["Time is a great teacher, but unfortunately it kills all its pupils.","At least I have the modesty to admit that lack of modesty is one of my failings.","The luck of having talent is not enough; one must also have a talent for luck.","Love cannot express the idea of music, while music may give an idea of love.","Every composer knows the anguish and despair occasioned by forgetting ideas which one had no time to write down."],"Hector Elizondo":["Food is a passion. Food is love.","You're at the top of your game if you do comedy.","You know, a low budget, you have to work harder. You have to plan well; you don't have much time to rehearse.","You can trust a Neil Simon script. Every dot. Every dash; that pause means something. He takes all the jokes out, practically.","Yes, and it's my third movie with Richard. American Gigolo was my first.","Which reminds me of a fortune cookie: you often find your destiny on the path you take to avoid it.","The fact that that's the difference between Mexicans and Cubans is pronounced. It's so immediately recognizable, the way a Cuban speaks, the way a Cuban moves the hands.","Sometimes I just walk through; I just show up, as in The Other Sister.","Pretty Woman was the easiest job I've ever done. I just wore the right toupee.","On those, I've said it before, I work free. It's the waiting they pay me for.","I've dodged bullets but there's no scandal in my life.","I'm attracted to pathos, because life is mostly pathos. I've had a lot of it in my life.","I'm a parent, especially when you've had the intense parenting the way I had. It's all in the bank. It's all in the great experience bank. Those are your secrets. That's the stuff that makes your work rich, that's what you dip into.","I work with Garry no matter what. What I wanted to keep going was the streak.","I used to work, part time, in a deli, in those days when your parents made you work just so you should know what work was like. And you'd make 4, 5, 6, ten dollars.","I think you can tell the human condition better through comedy.","I started in radio, again accidentally. I wasn't looking for this kind of work at all.","I started in 1946 in radio. I was ten years old. I was discovered singing in a school play. Someone was in the audience and it's six degrees of separation.","I never learned to cook; I was a little spoiled as far as that's concerned.","I love the fact that it starts from there, and you don't know where it's gonna go. Wait long enough - love will find you. Everything's a surprise. When you think you've got it all figured out... as Emerson said, the dice of God are always loaded.","I guess I work well with others I handle younger actors well.","Definitely not a sitcom, that's my first condition. No sitcoms."],"Hector Hugh Munro":["The sacrifices of friendship were beautiful in her eyes as long as she was not asked to make them.","A little inaccuracy sometimes saves a ton of explanation.","Hors d'oeuvres have always a pathetic interest for me; they remind me of one's childhood that one goes through wondering what the next course is going to be like - and during the rest of the menu one wishes one had eaten more of the hors d'oeuvres.","It's no use growing older if you only learn new ways of misbehaving yourself.","He spends his life explaining from his pulpit that the glory of Christianity consists in the fact that though it is not true it has been found necessary to invent it.","He's simply got the instinct for being unhappy highly developed.","Addresses are given to us to conceal our whereabouts.","I always say beauty is only sin deep.","The young have aspirations that never come to pass, the old have reminiscences of what never happened.","No one can be an unbeliever nowadays. The Christian Apologists have left one nothing to disbelieve.","You needn't tell me that a man who doesn't love oysters and asparagus and good wines has got a soul, or a stomach either. He's simply got the instinct for being unhappy highly developed.","Children with Hyacinth's temperament don't know better as they grow older; they merely know more.","Great Socialist statesmen aren't made, they're still-born."],"Hector Ruiz":["In this new world, with smartphones and tablets and cloud computing, things are moving around fast.","There is no way I could ever look somebody in the eye and say that I can make them feel good about the fact that they are losing their job.","My father said, 'Son, when you grow up, I don't want you to be a member of a party that caters to the oppressed and the poor. You have to aspire to be a member of a party that is happy, winning and influential.'","I don't want to be the underdog. I don't want to be the poor guy, getting kicked around.","For consumers to benefit from technology, there has to be fair and open competition. Fair and open competition is the only course we know that can lead to meaningful innovation.","In my humble opinion, the PC as we have known it is in a continuous decline and being relegated to a utility device for businesses.","Intel continues... to abuse their monopoly, and that's why, around the world, governments and regulatory agencies continue to go after them.","One of the things that has happened with technology is that it can only be helpful if it is useful, of course, but it can only be helpful too if it's accessible, and it can only be helpful if it's affordable."],"Hector Tobar":["Divorce was illegal in Chile up until 2005 or so.","I spent my whole life as a writer talking to just the average guy in Los Angeles and Latin America, talking to working people.","I've never been on a paperback tour before, you know, because usually you go on tour when a hardcover comes out.","I think, as journalists, we sometimes are afraid to enter into the emotional lives and the complications of the lives of the people we write about - we don't really have the space and the room to deal with those things. But as a novelist, that's precisely what you're writing about.","I think even a hero is someone who has sort of the flaw or imperfection of character. I remember Alice Walker saying that once - she'd written a novel about a civil rights hero, and it was someone who had this flaw, this central flaw.","You cannot bribe a Chilean police officer - I know this firsthand.","I come from a family of working people. My parents were Guatemalan immigrants who spent most of their lives in the service industry.","As a professional journalist, I've been interviewing people for almost thirty years. And the one thing I've learned from all those interviews is that I am always going to be surprised.","My job is to listen and to ask questions and to be respectful and win the trust of my subjects so that I can work my way into their memories and their point of view.","The influence of cinema on all contemporary writers is undeniable. Because film is such a powerful and popular art form, we prose writers think cinematically."],"Hedda Hopper":["I can wear a hat or take it off, but either way it's a conversation piece.","Two of the cruelest, most primitive punishments our town deals out to those who fall from favor are the empty mailbox and the silent telephone.","Nobody's interested in sweetness and light.","And in singing, what my voice lacked in quality it made up for in volume.","At one time I thought he wanted to be an actor. He had certain qualifications, including no money and a total lack of responsibility.","Dancing came easy to me.","She looks like she combs her hair with an egg beater."],"Hedda Sterne":["For me, cooking is an extension of love.","I was not an Abstract Expressionist. Nor was I an Irascible.","I knew I wanted to be an artist at age 5 or 6. I always drew. At 8, I was permitted to study.","Artists were always referred to as great artists. I thought that's what the profession was. One word: great-artist. There wasn't one moment in my life when I thought I wanted to be anything else."],"Hedi Slimane":["I don't like the collusion between high fashion design and high street. You have to know where you stand. I belong to luxury fashion. That's what I've always felt and embraced. I like the best quality, the best fabrics and the most creative field in fashion. I will stay consistent. I belong to this world.","I only like luxury fashion. You have to decide where you stand. I like well-made, authentic clothes, well-crafted tailoring. I also like the dream and fantasy of luxury, the exception and rarity of it. I have no interest at all in fast retail. It is ambiguous.","I like the ritual, the liturgy of a well-crafted, emotional fashion show. I will never be jaded with this side of fashion. The catwalk is pure anthropology, something like an esoteric encrypted parade. It can totally be replaced but it will be missed.","Just like zillions of children, album covers educated and informed me, and certainly did I later transpose organically, rather than by intent, those principles both in fashion design and photography.","With the rise of the Internet, fashion did become part of the global entertainment industry in the last ten years, and will follow the digital evolution of the music or film industry.","In the future, fast-fashion retailers might change their philosophy toward real efforts to create a world of their own. One can only hope.","Hedi was and is still misspelled 'Heidi,' and my perception of genders ended up slightly out of focus from an early age.","Photography has always been about documentary, the depiction of the instant, a moment, sometimes a place. Each project is somehow an experimentation of a specific context or a character.","Men are not supposed to be mysterious. That's what you say about women. But I think men can have a little of it, too.","Fashion somehow, for me, is purely and happily irrational.","An athletic man, or whatever you want to call him, will only look good in a very classic suit, a pair of classic jeans, athletic clothes or simply naked. Forget fashion. This is not going to happen, unless you want to look like a Chippendales dancer in designer clothes.","Men's fashion has a certain heaviness in the fabrics and construction. But also there is a heaviness in the mentality.","I discovered Los Angeles in the late '90s. The city was not at its best at the time, but I fell for it right away. There is something almost haunted about it, a vibrant mythology I find rather inspiring.","Sex is not a subject in my photographs, or would only be if it had to do with romance, sometimes vulnerability. The photographs are quite clearly about happiness, or search for happiness.","I always loved designing, but the context needs to be right, and have a positive perspective.","I love California. It has such a strong contribution to the history of culture, and popular culture. For better and worse, of course. Even the worst can be interesting to some degree sometimes for somebody creative.","I'm going to design again, but I come back when it's the right project, so I keep my passion for it intact.","David Bowie, for me, was the butchest guy in town. Jagger was like a truck driver.","People always want an explanation about everything and I cannot give it to them. Because I don't know myself. 'Why did you do a pair of pants like that?' I have no idea. I'm not going to have a 20-minute political discussion about the necessity for slashed, painted leather jeans. Basically, I don't know more than you.","I thought I should work more on the idea that you wear a suit or a jacket because of the fun it can provide, because it's a game, because it might even have a sexual quality.","The iPad needs to catch up with Flash before I put a hand on it.","I have a great admiration and tenderness for Azzedine Alaia. I haven't seen him in a while, but I guess he must be still sewing some dresses at night.","Music has shaped men's fashion, and transposed in a playful and witty manner its riding or military heritage. It is difficult to figure out who leads, but music and fashion are connected genetically.","Haute couture is a legitimate subject for Yves Saint Laurent and could resume one day.","When I was designing, I had in mind Jimi Hendrix, and I could hardly find skinny indie black kids to wear my clothes. I remember one telling me he had to swap his skinny jeans for baggy ones in the subway before going home, so he wouldn't get in trouble in his neighborhood.","The framework of men's wear is so narrow, that when you play at the edges you get labeled.","Since I was a child, my whole life has revolved around music. It's often while listening to a song that ideas for my fashion collections formed.","I like the idea of paradox, between the authentic fabrics and sophisticated shapes and between masculine and feminine. I'm not so much for sportswear. I think it's over."],"Hedy Lamarr":["Any girl can be glamorous. All you have to do is stand still and look stupid.","All creative people want to do the unexpected.","I don't believe in life after death. But I do believe in some grinding destiny that watches over us on earth. If I didn't, the safety valve would give and the boiler would explode.","A good painting to me has always been like a friend. It keeps me company, comforts and inspires.","I am not ashamed to say that no man I ever met was my father's equal, and I never loved any other man as much.","Analysis gave me great freedom of emotions and fantastic confidence. I felt I had served my time as a puppet.","I can excuse everything but boredom. Boring people don't have to stay that way.","Because you don't live near a bakery doesn't mean you have to go without cheesecake.","I advise everybody not to save: spend your money. Most people save all their lives and leave it to somebody else. Money is to be enjoyed.","I never go to funerals. To me a person is dead when he breathes for the last time. After that, your memories should be personal.","Any girl can look glamorous. All you have to do is stand still and look stupid.","I have not been that wise. Health I have taken for granted. Love I have demanded, perhaps too much and too often. As for money, I have only realized its true worth when I didn't have it.","My mother always called me an ugly weed, so I never was aware of anything until I was older. Plain girls should have someone telling them they are beautiful. Sometimes this works miracles.","Jack Kennedy always said to me, Hedy, get involved. That's the secret of life. Try everything. Join everything. Meet everybody.","I've met the most interesting people while flying or on a boat. These methods of travel seem to attract the kind of people I want to be with.","It is easier for women to succeed in business, the arts, and politics in America than in Europe.","I must quit marrying men who feel inferior to me. Somewhere there must be a man who could be my husband and not feel inferior.","All a woman needs is a good bath, clean clothes, and for her hair to be combed. These things she can do herself. I very seldom go to the hairdresser, but when I do, I just marvel.","I would tell anyone who wants something from someone else to feign not wanting it. People are perverse. If you show great affection to them, they'll run the other way.","Most children turn out badly because they have the wrong parental image. This doesn't mean their parents are criminal. It means they are boring and cruel.","Some men like a dull life - they like the routine of eating breakfast, going to work, coming home, petting the dog, watching TV, kissing the kids, and going to bed. Stay clear of it - it's often catching.","Compromise and tolerance are magic words. It took me 40 years to become philosophical.","I don't fear death because I don't fear anything I don't understand. When I start to think about it, I order a massage and it goes away.","American men, as a group, seem to be interested in only two things, money and breasts. It seems a very narrow outlook.","I'm a sworn enemy of convention. I despise the conventional in anything, even the arts.","I know when I'm working I seldom get into trouble. My educated guess is that boredom has caused most of the problems with Hollywood celebrities.","I have always felt that if a man gives you a solid gold key to his door he is entitled to the courtesy of a visit.","Let any pretty girl announce a divorce in Hollywood and the wolves come running. Fresh meat for the beast, and they are always hungry.","I've been an important star and lived a full life, yet I only hve three close friends. I guess that's all anyone can expect.","One of my favorite people is Gypsy Rose Lee. She bears out the Biblical promise that he who has, gets. And I hope she gets a lot more.","To be a star is to own the world and all the people in it. After a taste of stardom, everything else is poverty.","I know why most people never get rich. They put the money ahead of the job. If you just think of the job, the money will automatically follow. This never fails.","Making pictures, for an actress, is like betting, for a gambler. Each time you make a picture you try to analyze why you won or lost.","I find very often that very ugly women have really handsome men and vice versa because they don't have any competition. Sometimes handsome men have avoided me.","Confidence is something you're born with. I know I had loads of it even at the age of 15.","Men are most virile and most attractive between the ages of 35 and 55. Under 35 a man has too much to learn, and I don't have time to teach him.","The ladder of success in Hollywood is usually a press agent, actor, director, producer, leading man; and you are a star if you sleep with each of them in that order. Crude, but true.","Many people are target people. Once when Louis B. Mayer insulted me I poured a glass of water over his head.","I think women are concerned too much with their clothes. Men don't really care that much about women's clothes. If they like a girl, chances are they'll like her clothes.","I often talked to Bing Crosby, and while I liked him, I never understood why he was so popular. To me his voice was just a gimmick.","If I were to name my favorite pastime, I'd have to say talking about myself. I love it and I think most other people do too. We need, people like us, more listeners and less talkers.","The public pays and feels it is entitled to participate in the personal affairs of a performer.","I don't have any gnawing guilt over contributing to any unhappiness suffered by my husbands. They were as much to blame as I was.","All my six husbands married me for different reasons.","Experts always know everything but the fine points. When I took my citizenship exams, no one there knew how the White House came to be called the White House.","I remember all too well the premiere of Ecstasy when I watched my bare bottom bounce across the screen and my mother and father sat there in shock.","I was born an only child in Vienna, Austria. My father found hours to sit by me by the library fire and tell fairy stories.","I was in constant demand, in my professional life and my personal life.","I'd rather wear jewels in my hair than anywhere else. The face should have the advantage of this brilliance.","Perhaps my problem in marriage - and it is the problem of many women - was to want both intimacy and independence. It is a difficult line to walk, yet both needs are important to a marriage.","The ceremony took six minutes. The marriage lasted about the same amount of time though we didn't get a divorce for almost a year.","Dates with actors, finally, just seemed to me evenings of shop talk. I got sick of it after a hile. So the more famous I became, the more I narrowed down my choices.","Dirt makes a man look masculine. Let your hair blow in the wind, and all that. It's OK. All you have to do is look neat when you have to look neat.","I am a very good shot. I have hunted for every kind of animal. But I would never kill an animal during mating season.","I appreciate subtlety. I have never enjoyed a kiss in front of the camera. There's nothing to it except not getting your lipstick smeared.","I enjoy countless hundreds pursuing me. I love those who love me the most. I am sort of flattered by men showing attention to me.","I have never seen a wrestling match or a prize fight, and I don't want to. When I find out a man is interested in these sports, I drop him.","If I had my way everyone would have a psychiatrist. When the brain is sick and you must throw up, you do it by being purged in a psychiatrist's office.","It's funny about men and women. Men pay in cash to get them and pay in cash to get rid of them. Women pay emotionally coming and going. Neither has it easy.","Lawyers know how to take isolated complaints in a divorce case and build them into one big one.","When I attained a certain advanced intimacy with a man, and I don't just mean sex, I married him.","If you use your imagination, you can look at any actress and see her nude... I hope to make you use your imagination."],"Heidi Hayes Jacobs":["As educators, we are only as effective as what we know. If we have no working knowledge of what students studied in previous years, how can we build on their learning? If we have no insight into the curriculum in later grades, how can we prepare learners for future classes?","In America, we have 19th century school conditions and a curriculum that prepares our kids for the 1990s.","Education is a business - the growth business. It cultivates the growth of our learners, translates the growth of new knowledge, and builds professional growth.","Without question, students need to practice, review, and drill skills, but they should do so only in the spirit of working toward more complex mastery of those skills. Redundant drill of skills is inherently boring and insulting to the learner, and it is one of the most effective methods for turning students off to learning.","Mapping does not purport to create an idealistic vision where all teachers agree, love one another, and gather around a campfire and sing 'Curriculum Kumbaya.' What it can develop is a sense of place, of respect, and of new grounds for discussion, disputes, and direction.","Too often, teachers assume that they are introducing a book or concept to students for the first time. In fact, many units are repeated over the course of a student's K-12 experience.","Feeling pummeled by the outside pounding of tests and standards, a teacher can easily hide and simply turn to the immediacy of the classroom. It is not surprising that many teachers burrow in their rooms with all that they know about their students. There is no place to take the information.","The building blocks of mathematical thinking are requisite for more advanced conceptualization. If a student is not ready to move on, then the teacher must take time to assist that learner.","We often assume that all teachers within a discipline address the same curriculum. This isn't always the case. We frequently find gaps between goals and what is actually taught, and these gaps can have a lasting impact on a child's learning.","The function of a guideline isn't to tell you what kids have actually experienced; it's to provide goals.","Schools are launching pads, launching our kids into their futures. Unfortunately, a lot of what we teach now looks identical to what we taught 40, 50, or 60 years ago. There's a need for both timeless curriculum content and timely content. What seems to be falling by the wayside is timely content.","People in the United States are highly transient. Families move from state to state. So why do we take a full year - in some states, two years - to study state history? It takes time away from more important topics.","Rooted in the word 'history' is 'story.' And America's story is exceptional. It's amazing. Younger students should learn that we have always been and continue to be a land of immigrants - a land committed to bold new ideas.","A curious observation is the uniform way that committees review curriculum for each field of study. Too often, authorities have a knee-jerk impulse to declare that 'all curriculum areas will be the same.' In fact, real and significant differences exist between fields of study."],"Heidi Heitkamp":["Congressman Berg will repeatedly talk about Harry Reid and Barack Obama, and I find it interesting, because this morning, when I woke up and brushed my teeth, I looked in the mirror and I did not see a tall, African-American, skinny man. So let's make it clear that my priorities are North Dakota priorities.","We should show Washington how we do it in North Dakota. I'm running to stop the over-regulating of our economy and start growing it.","We can only imagine what would happen to our health care and to the quality of our health care here in North Dakota if we took the federal government out of health care."],"Heidi Julavits":["Usually I'll write all the way through to an end, and then I go back and try to fix the ending so that it makes sense. I don't think out the plot ahead of time.","A logic proof is: you get a starting point and an ending point, and you have to get there through all these different steps and tautologies. I approach novel writing that way. When I get to the end I have to go back and connect everything.","I think female-female relationships interest me so much more because they're so encoded. There is kind of a psychic element that happens within groups of women.","I obviously read and adore traditional fiction. I teach traditional fiction; I also teach all kinds of not-so-traditional fiction.","I spend far too much time on eBay buying lamps and upholstery remnants.","I buy a lot of books I've found via the Internet, whose existences I'd otherwise never have known about.","During the summers, when I'm in Maine, I work at a desk that's located beyond all tendrilly wi-fi reaches. It takes me a few days to break the constant e-mail-checking habit, then I find I don't want to check my e-mail ever, and often don't for days.","I won't deny that I have a far more productive writing life without the Internet, mostly because I rekindle my ability to concentrate on one thing for a period of longer than three minutes. My curiosity is channeled inward rather than Internet-ward."],"Heidi Klum":["I think it's important to get your surroundings as well as yourself into a positive state - meaning surround yourself with positive people, not the kind who are negative and jealous of everything you do.","I'm not saying that everyone should swim with sharks, but sometimes you have to jump over your own shadow in order to learn something that you will never forget for the rest of your life. Then you know you can conquer your fears.","I believe that when you put a smile out there, you get a smile back.","I've been heartbroken. I've broken hearts. That's part of life, and its part of figuring out who you are so you can find the right partner.","I am someone who always gets up again, even if there are setbacks. I have a survivor instinct. I'm not sure where it comes from, but probably from all the little things that make you into who you are.","I am generally a very happy and easygoing person. I also believe it's always better to meet people with a smile rather than looking cold, especially when you first meet. It changes everything.","You shouldn't wait for other people to make special things happen. You have to create your own memories.","Never underestimate the power of the ocean.","My motto is to go wild on the accessories - the belts, the hair clips, the jewelery.","I am generally a very happy and easygoing person.","If you love what you do, then you always find the time.","It's not difficult for me to stay healthy. I like healthy food.","Going blonde is like buying yourself a light bulb!","I'm not quite that difficult, even though maybe I'm a little bit bossy. But you know, in order to get things done, you do have to be a little bit bossy sometimes or tell people what you really want. Otherwise, things just don't get done, do they?","I'd say I'm a good cook. I have a lot of German recipes that I can make - schnitzel, meatballs and things with cabbage. I love cabbage.","When I was younger, I had a perm, and it was really big. My mom was a hairdresser, so even my dad had a perm! I looked like a poodle, but it was cool at the time.","I feel like looking in the mirror when you brush your teeth, yes, I see lines, and then I smile and I see things here and there. But that's just, you know, you - that's your journey, you know?","I was the little sister that was annoying.","I'm like a rocket - I go a hundred miles per hour.","I'm bad at baking. I'm bad at letting go of things. I'm probably bad at reading.","If you are talented, you can really do anything. And if your heart is at the right place and you have the passion for it, you can go for it and do it.","So everyone has that problem, models have that problem, too.","So to get back to being intimidated, yes, you get intimidated when you're on the runway with Naomi Campbell, who is the best runway model in the world.","I have the best husband in the world. He's very involved.","Sure, climbing Mount Everest would be cool, but that's something I would now like to do as a family. Big experiences like that I don't want to have on my own anymore. I want to share them.","If you have issues with family, friends, and people at work, try and solve these issues head on so you can move on and concentrate on having the life you want.","I think you always need to try your best, but at the same time you can only do what you can do, and you don't need to beat yourself up about it.","Sometimes random things that you wouldn't think mean anything mean so much to them. With kids, you can say, 'Let's go pick some flowers' or 'There's a snail. Let's investigate that.'","Keeping it all together as a modern woman means multitasking, especially when you work. I think you always need to try your best, but at the same time you can only do what you can do, and you don't need to beat yourself up about it. I'm not white-picket-fence perfect.","When you are just muscle, you end up being gaunt in the face, and that makes you look older by 5 or 10 years. I don't think of getting older as looking better or worse; it's just different. You change, and that's OK.","The main thing is healthy eating, exercise, which I do for special events, like if it's Sports Illustrated, or the swim suit catalogue for Victoria's Secret, or my own calendar that I did for the year 2000.","I'm bad at letting go of things.","I like to dream, but I like to make things happen.","I don't have my name on anything that I don't really do.","For me, my business is my business and my house is my house. I don't want the public in my house.","Fashion is a very particular world, as you know.","Being a Victoria's Secret model, which was always my dream.","A little acting debut in Spin City, with Michael J. Fox, which opened up a whole new door for me.","But I also want to have a family with children one day, which is very important to me.","I grew up in a big family with a lot of kids around, and I definitely want to have children as well.","I actually eat a lot.","I love painting.","Well, I was going to school in Germany. And in my free time I was dancing.","I danced for 15 years of my life. Which was my love and my passion.","But all the money in the world cannot make you happy either, so there has to be a balance.","I never went to a modeling school, and I don't suggest to anybody that they go to a modeling school... In fashion, one day you're in, the next you're out.","Well, I was already so happy being chosen to do the issue itself, that when I got on the cover, it was even more of a surprise and even more amazing to me.","A woman is a woman!","Because I'm on the runway with some of the best models in the industry.","I like basketball, and I've been to three games, which is so much more fun than seeing it on TV, I think.","I don't have the hard everyday life that so many working mothers face.","When I came out of school I didn't even think that modeling was a job.","I'm someone, the same as my girlfriends, when they say what do you think about this, I don't always say they look fabulous. I say what I think.","With a family of six, there is always something to make, create and do together.","I sing a lot, even with my voice.","Children are very addicting. Once they start growing up, you miss when they were little.","No Botox. I don't think I will go there. I don't want to say never, because who knows? Maybe in 10 years I will.","It's important for children to see what's out there and learn that it's fun to go.","I always wanted to be a mom.","I always think, look at how people were before they were pregnant. If you were a toned, healthy, energetic person, most likely you will be like that again.","I come from a place where we're not that shy about our bodies.","I need my products to work and be fast! I don't love having 50 different things in my bathroom, like a different cream for every inch of my face. That's so not me.","I have a whole army of pajamas.","I'm bad at baking.","As a model you need to be able to do the craziest things.","I certainly like working in Germany.","All German women are beautiful.","Every couple goes through things.","I'm quite scared of flying, and especially helicopters, I don't like them at all.","I wanted to be a fashion designer.","I have a normal life and I have this glamorous life, but to me it's two different things.","I'm quite good at multitasking, but I have to do things immediately.","I don't think I could not have been with an artist of some kind, someone creative.","I always did feel beautiful when I was pregnant, but I do feel more me when I'm my normal size.","I don't know why we work, my husband and I. We just do. We are black and white - yin and yang.","I'm a lioness. I have four cubs. I'm a mom. I want to take care of my kids and protect them.","For the longest time, you just sound like a broken record, but you have to be consistent when teaching kids.","I'm not white-picket-fence perfect.","I know a lot of celebrities who are perfectly happy to put their name to something and then leave it at that because the money is good, but I need to have complete control over how something is going to look if my name is going to be attached to it.","I like doing small parts, because I don't feel I'm that practised in acting. It's like making baby steps towards a bigger goal.","I like to wear things for longer than one season.","I have always been too round to do fashion shows.","Some people are born skinny, and that's just the way it is. You can't point a finger at them and say they're ill or anorexic. It isn't fair to people born that way.","I am into comedy.","You never know why something works or doesn't.","I'm not someone who plays hard to get.","I don't want to be wondering about how skinny I am, wondering what I'm going to eat because I don't want to gain and I want to look hot and young, always and forever.","It's not like I'm this glamour diva who hands everything over and I just sit on my throne at home.","I love when I go out and I have my hair and makeup done, but I also like it when I'm just with the family because that's real.","Apart from sharing my tips on toys or snacks, I'm open to hearing new ideas from other moms. I want to learn, too.","Family comes first. You're the only thing they have.","I was a good kid. My parents laid rules out for me, and I followed them.","In my job, people tell you that all the time: 'This shoot was great. You look amazing.' But you never know what they say when you turn away.","I don't know why I got so lucky. I have to pinch myself often and say, 'Is this just a dream?'","I think if you give your best as a parent, then that's all you can do.","I'm not that patient sometimes. I'm like a rocket - I go a hundred miles per hour.","I can't look in the mirror and look at fake things. I just can't. I'd rather age.","I used to do my own taxes. You know how you buy that gigantic sheet at Staples, add up the restaurants, clothes, and taxis and glue your receipts into the book month by month? The more money I made, the more complicated things got.","People say, 'Oh, God, how devastating to go through a divorce.' Did I wish for this to happen to my family? No. But everyone is healthy; we're moving on with our lives.","I was being rejected all the time. Agents would say, 'I don't think you're the type they're looking for.' I was always like, 'You think? I don't want you to think. I want them to think that.' This business is all about someone's opinion, but not the agent or the manager's. How do they know? They're not that person.","I'm going to be 80, walking with a stick down the runway.","I'm not someone who plays hard to get. This whole thing about 'Oh, let's exchange numbers' and then people wait four or five days before they call you? I don't see the point. If you feel something, why would you let that pass? You only live once.","My boys wear red pants or crazy color tops. My kids are more fashion forward in their own dressing.","My children love everything that sparkles. My boys just go with everything and make it their own, but my daughter is a little upset because she is 9 and I only go to 5, so sometimes she squeezes herself into a five, and she is trying to make that work because she wants to wear it, too.","I wouldn't push my kids to do anything. I want them to be happy, healthy, and I want them to be who they want to be, you know?","What are you going to do if you have all the money in the world and all the things that you wanted to achieve in your business and you have no one to share it with? You come home alone at the end of the day. And then what?","I'm a big believer in to-do lists. I think of five things in the shower. I set goals and get my work done, but I have to plan for fun things, too. I'm always thinking about what will make my family happier. So I set up playdates and trips.","I learned from working in the fashion world that if I have a day when I feel slapped in the face, or if someone has been mean, I just have to get back up and it will be another day. I think about what I'm grateful for. I look at my kids and my husband and think, Wow, I'm a really lucky person.","Your kids are happy if you're happy. And if your love is happy, then everything works. I think a lot of people think once the children are there, it's all about the children. But you can't forget about your best friend, your lover, your husband.","For me, my No. 1 priority in life was to always have a family. If I had not been able to work anymore, then that would have been it. I would definitely choose family over career. It's really great that my field has allowed me to work and let me do things that a woman does naturally."],"Heidi Montag":["I thought that plastic surgery was easy, but it is really serious and is not something you want to mess around with.","I didn't realize that pretending to be this 'Hills Heidi,' this spoiled rich girl who I wasn't, would almost destroy me.","I'm from really humble beginnings. I've never been this Hollywood diva, but you get caught up in what you're pretending to be.","I should have known growing up and not having any money ever that I should have kept every dollar that I had.","I got too caught up in Hollywood, being so into myself and my image.","I definitely regret the surgeries that I have had over the years, I think I was so young and in such an unstable situation in my life with so much going on and so much pressure.","If you want to change your hair colour or your nail colour or things like that its fine, but you have to realize the dangers and repercussions of surgery.","I thought I was investing in myself and my brand, like Kim Kardashian. When she buys these clothes, she's investing in herself, because she is a big brand and is likable. I thought I had that potential. My ego got too big. To think I could be someone like that when I was the most hated girl ever."],"Heidi Murkoff":["It doesn't take a brain surgeon... or a cardiologist... or a pediatrician... or even a policy wonk to figure out that a penny's worth of preventive care is worth many dollars of sick care.","When I was first pregnant, which was, let's see, in nineteen-eighty-three - I remember wearing a regular bathing suit to my in-laws' pool. It was just like a spandex one-piece, completely modest, and yet people were looking at me like it was obscene.","I'm not here to judge, I'm here to empower women to figure out what's best for them.","I was the first in my peer group to get pregnant. All I craved was reassurance. I needed someone to tell me that all the seemingly random symptoms I had - weird things, such as excess saliva - were normal. And I was worried because I wasn't getting any morning sickness.","Taking pre-natal vitamins can minimise birth defects and can lower the chances both of morning sickness and premature delivery.","Healthy bodies make healthy babies so you have nothing to lose!","Is there a downside to eating well and getting in shape?","As obesity creeps into preschools, and hypertension and type II diabetes become pediatric problems for the very first time, the case for starting preventive health care in the cradle has become too compelling to keep ignoring."],"Heidi Roizen":["I can't tell you how many board meetings I've been in where the CEO is anguished over the impacts on morale that cost cutting or layoffs will bring about. You know what hurts morale even more than cost-cutting and layoffs? Going out of business.","The individual dynamics going on within a venture fund are critically important to you. Unfortunately, they're also very opaque.","Venture capital is debt. People don't understand that.","You can't let a failure keep you down, because if you stay down after you fail, you are going to stay down for good.","I don't know any successful entrepreneur that doesn't have at least a handful of stories about the things they did that went horribly wrong.","If you're the only woman in the room, and you raise your hand, there's a good chance your question's going to get answered. You stand out.","I think women let themselves be burdened by failures much more than men do. They agonize - and I do it a lot, too - and rethink them.","Women as consumers are a very powerful force.","If you have to be a female in business, Silicon Valley is the best place because it's a meritocracy. It's not about who you are, it's about what you can do.","Don't define yourself by your mistakes or by the single thing you are at your work.","I put working out on my calendar as if it were a part of my job. It makes exercise as important a priority as brushing my teeth - something I need to do every day.","I used to fall into the trap of thinking that taking care of my husband and kids was more important than taking care of myself. Now I have a new attitude: You know when you're on an airplane and the manual tells you to put on your oxygen mask first and then help the person next to you? I feel the same way about my health.","I bought myself a DVD set of 'Lost' and only allowed myself to watch it while I was strength training. Sometimes I'd exercise longer than I intended to because I didn't want to turn it off. Talk about positive reinforcement!","I thought of calorie-counting as a budget: I was happy to skip bread at dinner so I could 'spend' on a glass of wine.","You can't write about a personal struggle if you're going to water it down to meet everyone's expectations about what's appropriate.","I like to make good things happen for other people. It makes me happy, and I believe it's good for my business as well.","Do deals with the people you want to work with, and the success will follow.","I'm the classic old-school entrepreneur that says let's build companies of lasting value.","Isn't it interesting that markets are not just perfect? In business school and economic theory, you learn all about those perfect markets, and there's no such thing as a perfect market.","My dog wants the entrepreneurial community to know how thankful she is for the fact that she gets to go out. She has heard more pitches than probably much of the world.","You know what somebody else's fundraise metrics are to you? Irrelevant. You know what your own last round post was? Irrelevant. Yes, I know, not legally, because of those pesky rights and preferences. But emotionally, trust me: it is irrelevant now. We even have a name for this - valuation nostalgia.","You know what kind of companies generally survive? Companies that make more money than they spend. I know, duh, right?","I know a few CEOs who delegate the understanding of their financials and their business metrics to the CFO, and then stop worrying about all that 'numbers stuff.' Don't do that. You have to know your numbers inside and out - they are your life blood."],"Heikki Kovalainen":["In golf, you have to stay patient and calm. On the race track you can let loose, but in golf you can't and you must be calm.","I enjoy playing golf, but no, I don't think golf helps driving. It does take my mind away from driving, though; every time I play golf, I don't think about Formula 1.","I have many golfer friends whom I play with, including my good friend Ian Poulter, a professional golfer who's coming to Asia to play in a few tournaments.","Golf is just for fun. I have no time to be a pro golfer, not even after F1. I think it's too late and I'm too old to learn now. Golf is just a hobby and maybe I can improve a little bit more.","I am quite a relaxed person out of the car, but in the car I am aggressive, I never give up, I fight to the end and I try 100% all the time.","When I started go-karting at the age of six, I always dreamt of becoming a Formula One driver.","Nothing's ever too fast. Maybe sometimes on the road some people are too fast if they don't know how to control the car, but in racing, the faster and more power and grip, the better it is.","Danger is part of my job. It's always there, but you can't think about it too much otherwise you start to be too slow.","Normally I tell the truth whether it's nice or not.","I'm a big James Bond fan. I've got a collection of them.","I saw Lotus F1 racing as the best choice for me to progress my career, after considering several other options that were available to me."],"Heinrich Boll":["Literature has its own life, even in a dictatorship like the Soviet Union.","I long for the time of no more departures. It has something to do with age, probably.","Humor is really one of the hardest things to define, very hard. And it's very ambiguous. You have it, or you don't. You can't attain it.","On a visit to Cologne in March 1945, after a heavy bombing, I met hundreds and hundreds of deserters who were squatting in the rubble, many in the deep cellars left from Roman times. They had been hiding there after the retreat from France.","My most interesting correspondence is with my translators. I marvel at their sensitivity over certain passages that just anyone, even if he knows German well, would not appreciate.","I was born December 21, 1917, in Cologne, on the Rhine, the son of the sculptor and cabinet-maker, Viktor Boell, and his wife, Maria, nee Hermanns.","Between 1950 and 1951, I worked as a temporary employee in the Cologne Bureau of Statistics. From summer 1951 on, I have lived as a freelance writer with a fixed postal address in Cologne but with a continually shifting place of work.","No one will ever know how many novels, poems, analyses, confessions, sufferings and joys have been piled up on this continent called Love, without it ever having turned out to be totally investigated.","It's true and it's easily said that language is material, and something does materialise as one writes.","For me, at least, much of the German I see and hear sounds stranger than Swedish, a language of which I unfortunately understand very little.","Politicians, ideologists, theologians and philosophers try time and again to provide solutions with nothing remaining: prefab solved problems.","The Nazi period could have happened only in Germany because the German education of obedience to any law and order was the main problem.","I will never forget the moment when I was liberated by the American Army. I will never forget those very young boys coming up the hill, who had to take me a prisoner to liberate me.","Many writers are radical. I am not, because of my age and because of my terrible fear of demagogy.","We must learn, and especially we Germans, that resistance is not only possible and allowed in dictatorships. There is resistance that man must perform every day.","Because the completion of labour service was a precondition for permission to study at the university, I was able to begin my studies of Germanistics and Classical Philology during the summer term of 1939.","As early as December 1945, I accompanied my wife and a few relatives in their return from evacuation in the countryside to Cologne, where over the years we settled down in a destroyed house.","Medals don't suit me. I'm not that kind of guy.","The war is not planned. I don't believe that any responsible person plans it. But it's thought as possible."],"Heinrich Heine":["Communism possesses a language which every people can understand - its elements are hunger, envy, and death.","When the heroes go off the stage, the clowns come on.","Music played at weddings always reminds me of the music played for soldiers before they go into battle.","When words leave off, music begins.","You cannot feed the hungry on statistics.","I fell asleep reading a dull book and dreamed I kept on reading, so I awoke from sheer boredom.","Wherever they burn books they will also, in the end, burn human beings.","Great genius takes shape by contact with another great genius, but, less by assimilation than by friction.","Matrimony; the high sea for which no compass has yet been invented.","Of course God will forgive me; that's His job.","Experience is a good school. But the fees are high.","True eloquence consists in saying all that is necessary, and nothing but what is necessary.","Whenever books are burned, men also in the end are burned.","God will forgive me; that's his business.","It is extremely difficult for a Jew to be converted, for how can he bring himself to believe in the divinity of - another Jew?","Talking and eloquence are not the same: to speak and to speak well are two things. A fool may talk, but a wise man speaks.","I will not say that women have no character; rather, they have a new one every day.","Christ rode on an ass, but now asses ride on Christ.","Sleep is good, death is better; but of course, the best thing would to have never been born at all.","Oh, what lies there are in kisses.","Atheism is the last word of theism.","Whether a revolution succeeds or fails people of great hearts will always be sacrificed to it.","I have never seen an ass who talked like a human being, but I have met many human beings who talked like asses.","God will forgive me. It's his job.","I do not know if she was virtuous, but she was ugly, and with a woman that is half the battle.","If the Romans had been obliged to learn Latin, they would never have found time to conquer the world.","The fundamental evil of the world arose from the fact that the good Lord has not created money enough.","The Wedding March always reminds me of the music played when soldiers go into battle.","He only profits from praise who values criticism.","In earlier religions the spirit of the time was expressed through the individual and confirmed by miracles. In modern religions the spirit is expressed through the many and confirmed by reason.","There are more fools in the world than there are people.","Whatever tears one may shed, in the end one always blows one's nose.","The Bible is the great family chronicle of the Jews.","Every man, either to his terror or consolation, has some sense of religion.","Woman is at once apple and serpent.","Ask me not what I have, but what I am.","Human misery is too great for men to do without faith.","In these times we fight for ideas and newspapers are our fortress.","Sleep is lovely, death is better still, not to have been born is of course the miracle.","The men of action are, after all, only the unconscious instruments of the men of thought.","It is a common phenomenon that just the prettiest girls find it so difficult to get a man.","Like a great poet, Nature knows how to produce the greatest effects with the most limited means."],"Heinrich Mann":["The Bourbon King was first ambassador of reason and human happiness.","Goodness means the highest degree of popularity.","And my father, after all, was a nationalist.","There is no better way of elevating the novel than by making it into a construct which contains ideas."],"Heinrich Rohrer":["Science means constantly walking a tightrope between blind faith and curiosity; between expertise and creativity; between bias and openness; between experience and epiphany; between ambition and passion; and between arrogance and conviction - in short, between an old today and a new tomorrow.","End of the sixties, Keith Blazey interested me to work on GdAlO3, an antiferromagnet on which he had done optic experiments. This started a fruitful cooperation on magnetic phase diagrams, which eventually brought me into the field of critical phenomena.","Scientific fraud, plagiarism, and ghost writing are increasingly being reported in the news media, creating the impression that misconduct has become a widespread and omnipresent evil in scientific research.","In all the years with IBM Research, I have especially appreciated the freedom to pursue the activities I found interesting and greatly enjoyed the stimulus, collegial cooperation, frankness, and intellectual generosity of two scientific communities, namely in superconductivity and critical phenomena.","The new generation of researchers must be given the skills and values - not just scientific ideals, but also awareness of human weaknesses - that will enable it to correct its forebears' mistakes.","In summer 1961, Rose-Marie Egger became my wife, and her stabilizing influence has kept me on an even keel ever since. Our honeymoon trip led us to the United States where I spent two post-doc years working on thermal conductivity of type-II superconductors and metals in the group of Professor Bernie Serin at Rutgers University in New Jersey.","In 1974/75, I spent a sabbatical year with Professor Vince Jaccarino and Dr. Alan King at the University of California in Santa Barbara to get a taste of nuclear magnetic resonance. We solved a specific problem on the bicritical point of MnF2, their home-base material. We traded experience, NMR, and critical phenomena.","Even in technology, you have the freedom to solve a problem your way, you see. But it naturally sits in a certain framework whereas, in the physics, everybody had to come up with his own idea what he was going to do.","The scientists do not get enough help, enough encouragement, to change their field from time to time because the pressure is too high or is to perform something. And once you start in a new field, you are a nobody to start with, you see."],"Heinrich Schliemann":["From that moment, I did not cease to pray to God that by his grace it might one day be permitted to me to learn Greek.","We could imagine nothing pleasanter than to spend all of our lives digging for relics of the past.","No, this customary aim of research by excavators is completely foreign to the historical work with which I am occupied... my sole and only aim is to be able to establish a historical fact, on which I disagree with some eminent historians and geographers."],"Heinz Fischer":["I declare myself an Austrian and a European. A united Europe will be a peaceful Europe.","We have all examined our past critically and are very much aware of even the unpleasant things. Now, we need to look at what we plan to do with the lessons we have learned from the past."],"Heinz Guderian":["If the tanks succeed, then victory follows.","There are no desperate situations, there are only desperate people.","Whenever in future wars the battle is fought, armored troops will play the decisive role.","It is decisive to completely destroy Warsaw.","It is sometimes tougher to fight my superiors than the French.","You hit somebody with your fist and not with your fingers spread.","Logistics is the ball and chain of armored warfare.","The engine of the tank is a weapon just as the main-gun."],"Heinz R. Pagels":["The world changed from having the determinism of a clock to having the contingency of a pinball machine.","Stars are like animals in the wild. We may see the young but never the actual birth, which is a veiled and secret event.","Science cannot resolve moral conflicts, but it can help to more accurately frame the debates about those conflicts.","Science shows us what exists but not what to do about it.","I like to browse in occult bookshops if for no other reason than to refresh my commitment to science."],"Helen Andelin":["The first Law of Heaven is obedience, and it should be the first law of every home. It is the foundation of an orderly home, a successful family, and the successful lives of the children. The wife is the key.","The problems of rebellious youth can be traced to homes where the mother disobeyed the father or showed lack of respect for his authority.","A man wants a woman who will place him at the top of his priority list, not second but first. He wants to be the kingpin around which all other activities of her life revolve.","One of the greatest threats to your husband's position of priority would be if you were to earnestly pursue a career... If you finally reach a pinnacle of success, you would overshadow him and make him feel unimportant.","It is not always possible or even right for a man to make his wife number one in his life. This is due to the nature of his life. His number one responsibility is to provide the living."],"Helen Clark":["There is also a marked global trend towards sustainable agriculture, building on traditional methods which use fewer chemical inputs, carefully manage soil and water resources, and work hand-in-hand with nature.","Although biodiversity loss continues globally, many countries are significantly slowing the rate of loss by shoring up protected natural areas and the services they provide, and in expanding national park systems with tighter management and more secure funding.","If you neglect those who are currently poor and stable, you may create more poor and unstable people. There has been a tremendous concentration of donor interest in countries that are seen as particularly fragile - but it becomes harder to mobilise money for sub-Saharan, plain poor countries.","Any serious shift towards more sustainable societies has to include gender equality.","We just sent our condolences to the President of the United States and the American people on what is a terrible, terrible tragedy.","Of course I have an opinion on many things but I don't micromanage.","I think that generally New Zealand is respected for the positions it takes because it thinks them through.","Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries on earth. Security issue or no security issue, there would need to be a focus on it.","'Never look back' is my philosophy.","If the market is left to sort matters out, social injustice will be heightened and suffering in the community will grow with the neglect the market fosters.","Of course as a small country you're not necessarily in the strongest negotiating position unless you're negotiating with other small countries.","I'm not into power for the sake of it.","Business can talk itself into a blue funk.","Well of course New Zealand isn't anti-American.","In terms of having views and being prepared to express them, yes, I think New Zealand's had a leadership role in a lot of things.","As New Zealanders, we've been in on the United Nations from the very beginning, played a role in the drafting of the charter - it means a lot to us that those processes are followed.","Well in the end the world can crank itself up to sanctions, as it has with Zimbabwe, another sad case.","We don't want to deal with a separatist party.","I have no beliefs of a religious kind.","Well, there have been periods in the past when prime ministers of Australia and New Zealand were at each others' throats publicly and frequently. That's not productive at all.","Well, we don't think for a moment that either the U.S. or Australia are out to damage the New Zealand economy, but if there were a sustained period in which they had a free-trade agreement and New Zealand didn't have that same arrangement with the States, that could be both trade- and investment-distorting.","I've been round Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, and China in the last few months and the message that I've been taking is that New Zealand is building an up market dynamic into a connected economy. And that we are not the old-fashioned, ship mutton kind of product the people associate their export in work.","The Prime Minister is head of team but its not a one woman act. I've been called all those things. Intellectual, sharp-tongued, all true. But what New Zealander is like is to know that someone is in charge and in the end the buck stops with the Prime Minister.","I think the issue of North Korea is one where the international community as a whole has to work to resolve the crisis.","Fortunately New Zealand doesn't have land borders so we are able to be somewhat more rigorous on who gets in and out of our country than perhaps some people.","I deeply detest social distinction and snobbery, and in that lies my strong aversion to titular honours.","New Zealand's been pretty quiet on human rights issues, which we will be taking rather more interest in, and in international labor issues.","In the end, there will always be a fundamental difference of perspective between New Zealand and Australia on defense, whoever is in government.","Marine protected areas, and particularly no-take zones, are very effective in allowing regeneration of fish stocks.","I think it's inevitable that New Zealand will become a republic and that would reflect the reality that New Zealand is a totally sovereign-independent 21st century nation 12,000 miles from the United Kingdom.","Health and education are always issues.","People are optimistic about the future.","It's fair to say that, for much of my lifetime, New Zealand certainly was a property-owning democracy and working people, ordinary people, had assets.","I don't know that you're ever going to persuade New Zealanders that they're not going to own their own homes and I'm not going to try.","We're a nation in search of an identity, but it's quite exciting. I don't regard it as a problem. It's a challenge."],"Helen Craig":["I grew up during the war years in a tiny cottage with no electricity. Water for washing was pumped from a pond. My brother and I had to fetch drinking water from a tap at the end of the lane, and light was from candles, paraffin lamps, and our nightly log fire.","I started drawing a mouse because it was my father's nickname for my mother. And mice are very expressive.","I didn't draw Angelina to be famous; I did it simply because I've always had to earn a living.","It's great to be working. Every morning, I wake up and pinch myself.","Mice are very difficult to do front on, but they have nicely human little hands and feet, and whiskers and tails are great for expressing emotion.","When you read 'author Katharine Holabird, creator of Angelina' and you're not even mentioned, you wince.","As a child, I had always wanted to know what lay at the end of a corridor or behind a door in a picture, so I did a floorplan and elevations of Angelina's house and learned my way around it. The idea was that children should start to feel at home in it.","My great influence has been Maurice Sendak, who drew 'Where the Wild Things Are.' His characters really interact with each other.","If an actor only comes alive when he has lines to say, it doesn't work, and the same goes for illustrated characters."],"Helen Dunmore":["Mourning Ruby is not a flat landscape: it is more like a box with pictures painted on every face. And each face is also a door which opens, I hope, to take the reader deep into the book.","The language has got to be fully alive - I can't bear dull, flaccid writing myself and I don't see why any reader should put up with it.","If we understand the past, we are more likely to recognise what is happening around us.","As individuals, we are shaped by story from the time of birth; we are formed by what we are told by our parents, our teachers, our intimates.","Those who try to obliterate the past are injuring the present.","Writing poetry makes you intensely conscious of how words sound, both aloud and inside the head of the reader. You learn the weight of words and how they sound to the ear.","Writing children's books gives a writer a very strong sense of narrative drive.","When you are young you don't always realise how full of doubts everybody is.","To try to expunge an individual's history is a terrible violation.","The poets whom I knew then were all men and all seemed dauntingly sure of themselves - although I am sure that really they were as uncertain as I was.","Poets go through a very tough apprenticeship in the use of words.","My first collection of poems was published by Bloodaxe Books, which was then a very new imprint.","It is a violation which has obsessed the tyrants of the twentieth century. They do not want simply to kill their opponents, but to liquidate them, to deny that they have ever existed.","I would like people to come into my Dreamworld and then choose to stay.","I was always influenced by language.","I hope that readers will tear through my books because they can't stop themselves - and then, maybe, read them again and find new things there.","I have learned so much from working with other poets, travelling and reading with them, spending days discussing poems in progress. There is the sense that we are all, as writers, part of something which is more powerful than any of us.","I enjoy research; in fact research is so engaging that it would be easy to go on for years, and never write the novel at all.","I didn't choose Russia but Russia chose me. I had been fascinated from an early age by the culture, the language, the literature and the history to the place.","I could start with Mandelstam, who was a huge influence on my early writing.","I concentrate on the lives of individuals whom the reader comes to know and feel with intimately.","I can remember being in my pram: children stayed in their prams much longer then than they do now. A big bouncy pram with black covers and a hood with metal clips that could trap your fingers. I was looking up at my sister who was sitting on the pram seat, with her back to me.","However, the difficulties and pleasures of the writing itself are similar for a novel with a historical setting and a novel with a contemporary setting, as far as I'm concerned.","However, I began to submit poems to British magazines, and some were accepted. It was a great moment to see my first poems published. It felt like entering a tradition.","Fiction came quite a while later. I began with short stories and fiction for children.","Children will not pretend to be enjoying books, and they will not read books because they have been told that these books are good. They are looking for delight.","A novel, in the end, is a container, a shape which you are trying to pour your story into."],"Helen Fielding":["I like L.A. It's like a mini break. For a writer, it's hilarious. Like the food. Where I come from, we eat chip sandwiches: white bread, butter, tomato catsup and big fat french fries. It's delicious. Here, you order a creme caramel and the waiter says, 'You know, that contains dairy.'","Dieting on New Year's Day isn't a good idea as you can't eat rationally but really need to be free to consume whatever is necessary, moment by moment, in order to ease your hangover. I think it would be much more sensible if resolutions began generally on January the second.","It's rather fun writing a female spy, because she has so much more kit. Bond never carried a hair dryer or a makeup bag. And he certainly didn't wear an uplift bra.","It is a truth universally acknowledged that as soon as one part of your life starts looking up, another falls to pieces.","Nobody wants to be racist and I think that most people aren't.","I was writing an earnest novel about cruises in the Caribbean and I just started writing 'Bridget Jones' to get some money, to finance this earnest work, and then I chucked it out.","I think that when you're writing fiction what you're doing is reflecting life as you see it, and putting down how you think and how other people think, and the sort of confusions that you don't normally like to admit to.","If we can't have comedy books written about aspects of womanhood without going into a panic attack about it, then we haven't got very far at being equal.","There are so many images pushed at women and so many ideas of what you're supposed to be. I think there's too much of this superwoman, this woman with a bottom like two billiard balls. There's no real celebration of just being a person.","I certainly think I'll end up writing about America in some form. I've taken plenty of notes. I like America very much.","Women today are bombarded with so many messages, like we should have Naomi Campbell's body and Madeleine Albright's career.","I always market research my books before I hand them in by showing them to five or six close friends who I trust to be honest with me, so they are very heavily re-written already.","The whole point of diaries is that other people find them and read what you've put. I did once take to writing my inner thoughts on the computer at the end of other things I was writing and ended up faxing four pages of hideous stuff to my accountant so I don't do that now.","I've had a lot of books rejected in my time. My first novel, which didn't get published, was, with hindsight, crashingly dull.","My books have all generated controversy.","Comedy tends to come out of things which are quite painful and serious.","It is horrid to smirk.","I come from Yorkshire in England where we like to eat chip sandwiches - white bread, butter, tomato ketchup and big fat french fries cooked in beef dripping."],"Helen Fisher":["Good-looking people are always looking for other good-looking people.","Natural beauty really entices men. They will tell you this time and time again, and studies consistently prove it.","When you massage someone, the levels of oxytocin go up in the brain, and oxytocin is one of the chemicals that drives attachment.","Jealousy can even be good for love. One partner may feel secretly flattered when the other is mildly jealous. And catching someone flirting with your beloved can spark the kind of lust and romance that reignites a relationship.","There's biology in everything, even when you're feeling spiritual.","We evolved in a tropical climate where the smells of plants and flowers were all around us. We spent a lot of time in the trees with a lot of sunlight and no clothes.","Your sweetheart calls you by another's name. His eyes linger too long on your best friend. He talks with excitement about a girl at work. And the fire catches. Jealousy - that sickening combination of possessiveness, suspicion, rage, and humiliation - can overtake your mind and threaten your very core as you contemplate your rival.","The Great Depression of the 1930s saw more American unmarried women working from nine to five, mostly in repetitive, boring, subordinate, dead-end jobs. But the number of working women doubled between 1870 and 1940. During World War II it doubled once again.","Women are better at reading body language everywhere in the world. As a matter of fact, it's associated with the female hormone estrogen. Women are better at figuring out of tone of voice, reading your face and posture and gesture.","Anthropologists have found evidence of romantic love in 170 societies. They've never found a society that did not have it.","Men and women are like two feet; they can help each other get ahead.","People compose poetry, novels, sitcoms - for love.","Love is not an emotion; it is a drive.","Why do we feel jealousy? Therapists often regard the demon as a scar of childhood trauma or a symptom of a psychological problem. And it's true that people who feel inadequate, insecure, or overly dependent tend to be more jealous than others.","You know, when you've been dumped, the one thing you love to do is just forget about this human being, and then go on with your life - but no, you just love them harder.","It certainly would have been adaptive for ancestral man to have a chubby wife during stressful times of famine. Not only would she have had more calories to burn, and thus more energy and endurance, but since fat stores estrogen, she would have remained fertile for longer.","Mothers really were not built to raise babies not only by themselves, but with only a partner. For millions of years, a woman had much more than just her husband to help rear her young... This whole idea of 'it takes a village to raise a child' is exactly how we're supposed to live.","At first I assumed hate was the opposite of love. But it isn't. The opposite of love is indifference.","Globalization requires taking a broad contextual and long-term view.","Research shows that couples who have a lot of similarities, including intellectual compatibility, end up staying together.","Today, most women are surrounded by ingenious gadgets. They don't grow the peas or raise the chicken that they serve for dinner; instead they hunt and gather in the grocery store. They go through catalogs or department stores to buy clothes instead of shearing sheep, carding wool, and weaving cloth for skirts and coats and blankets.","We're apt to fall in love with those who are mysterious and challenging to us.","I suspect privacy is a very new concept to humanity.","People have often asked me whether what I know about love has spoiled it for me. And I just simply say, 'Hardly.' You can know every single ingredient in a piece of chocolate cake, and then when you sit down and eat that cake, you can still feel that joy.","From my studies of genetics and neuroscience I have come to believe that people fall into four broad personality types - each influenced by a different brain chemical: I call them the Explorer, Builder, Director, and Negotiator.","Men have a psychological need to show off their courage and strength. When he sees you talking to another guy, that instinct kicks in and he jumps to protect you and prove he's worthy of your love.","Romantic love is an addiction.","Kissing is not just kissing. It is a major escalation or de-escalation point in a powerful process of mate choice.","Any kind of novelty or excitement drives up dopamine in the brain, and dopamine is associated with romantic love.","Sometimes we fall in love with somebody who will probably never love us, for reasons having nothing to do with us but with their own mindset, their chemistry.","Experiences shape the brain, but the brain shapes the way we view experiences, too.","A lot of people head into courtship looking for fireworks. Don't pass up a chance by dumping someone after a first date because you don't feel the fireworks. The fireworks can happen at any time and be maintained.","Women are naturally prone to compete over their mates.","You've got to remember that men are men and women are women. And although a lot of similarities, there are some real differences.","Nobody gets out of love alive. You turn into a menace or a pest when you've been rejected.","After a man falls madly in love, he no longer cares how old she is.","The Internet lets women use words, which is their natural tool. Little girls speak in more complex, grammatical sentences than little boys do, and women never lose that superiority in verbal ability.","Women have a better sense of smell than men do, and it's even sharper in the middle of their menstrual cycle, when estrogen levels peak and women are more likely to be deciding whether a man's attractive.","You fall in love with somebody who fits within what I call your 'love map,' an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up. And I also think that you gravitate to certain people, actually, with somewhat complementary brain systems.","We are wired to find love.","You can be instantly scared. You can be instantly happy. So why can't you be instantly romantically in love? I think when it happens, it's because you are ready to fall in love.","Every time you cuddle with your children, you're likely to be driving down your testosterone.","We're not very dangerous animals; we don't have a horn like a rhino or quills like a porcupine.","Your face and head give more information about you than any other body part.","Haiti is the poorest country in the western hemisphere; some say the poorest in the world.","More and more of us live segmented, compartmentalized lives. This isn't natural. For millions of years, our forebears knew everyone around them and everyone knew them.","Neither gender is routinely more jealous - although women are more willing to work to win back a lover, while men tend to flaunt their money and status and are more likely to walk out to protect their self-esteem or save face.","Overdone lipstick is a deterrent to men. It rubs off easily onto their skin and the edges of their shirts, so it discourages them from kissing, touching, and coming closer to you, which is what they really want to do!","Throughout evolution, ostracism was death indeed.","The reason you take antidepressants is to feel calm. And romantic love is not calm - it's elation, it's mood swings, and you're killing all that when you take the drug.","A woman will toss her head and a man will say, 'Oh she's trying to pick me up,' when in fact she's not doing that at all. So, women actually have to be a little careful with what they do, because men will pick up things that they didn't mean.","When people tell you to walk a certain way, it's like not thinking of a purple tomato. You can't not do it.","In America, we are demanding everything from our marriage.","Since when is anyone truly honest with anyone?","Office romances are few, short, and not usually destructive.","For so many generations, a woman's only career path was to marry well and to marry up. Those days have changed.","In that early-love stage, you're in that state of exhilaration. You talk till dawn. You become obsessed with 'What does he think?' 'Does he like me?' 'Does he think I'm fat?'","When you're in the throes of this romantic love, it's overwhelming - you're out of control, you're irrational, you're going to the gym at 6 A.M. every day - Why? Because she's there.","You can really get poked in the back and not feel it very much, but just a feather around your lips and you really do feel it.","There were real reasons that you were attracted to somebody originally. The brain doesn't pick willy-nilly. Unless you part ways hating each other for some reason, that mechanism could get triggered again. You can literally fall in love again.","Liberals and conservatives are looking for entirely different things. Their attitudes toward romance and how they court are really dramatically different. There's almost no overlap.","There is more and more data indicating that there is a biological basis to your political views.","My hypothesis is that conservative Republicans have very clear values, and when you have that, you're simply more relaxed.","I can't conceive of caring more about my president than my own partner.","There's every reason to think SSRIs blunt your ability to fall and stay in love.","There are cognitive processes and limbic reactions associated with basic emotions. And you can change brain chemistry, but you're still not going to change memories and experiences in a human being.","Romantic love allows you to focus mating energy. Attachment sustains that relationship as long as necessary to raise your baby.","People have been looking for love potions since hunter-gatherer societies.","People kill for love. They die for love.","Of all the foods we share, there is nothing more primordial than meat. It's no surprise that meat-eaters still want a partner who will give, receive and share this primordial symbol of a budding partnership.","The women's movement is just a symptom of basic changes in the economy that are favoring women.","When you look at the brain regions associated with picking up data from the body, a huge amount of the brain is devoted to picking up information from the lips and tongue.","When chimps threaten, they open their mouth and show their teeth. It's a little like waving a knife in front of you. It's very primitive, and therefore bizarre.","I've always maintained that men were more romantic than women.","Men tend to be hierarchical, but women are driven to make lateral connections so they can cooperate.","Both sexes like the exercise and challenge of sports, but for men it's also a basic display behavior for impressing and winning a mate.","I think that property is very important in this day and age. It defines you; you worked hard to get it. It's meaningful to you, and when you divorce, a lot of people have a lot of battles over their property for good reasons.","We all have restlessness in long-term relationships.","You can get into a very fancy car and know everything about the engine, but when you drive in that car, you feel that rush. In the same way, I think the more you know about love, the more you can enjoy it. And knowing about your personality type, who you are and what kind of person you're dealing with gives you a great leg up.","We still have community, but we don't seem to have local community. Even in a small town where you know your neighbors and your mother's down the street, they're not in arm's length.","Like most animals, we're wired to associate height with power.","In courtship, who wins and who loses will determine who passes on their DNA to tomorrow.","A woman of 40 or 50 or 60 can take estrogen replacements, get facelifts, spend her money in bars.","If two very different people pool their DNA, they'll create more genetic variety, and their young will come to the job of parenting with a wider array of skills.","When you can't have someone but you're not willing to accept that, you try harder and become more extreme about it. Either you win the person back or you drive him away.","Women like signs of money and education - things that indicate that not only is this guy going to have some resources, but he's also willing to share them.","Women have a better sense of color and a better color memory. They're more likely to notice when something doesn't match; more likely to notice what you're wearing.","Touch is the mother of the senses. Not only are women more sensitive when they touch, but they're also more sensitive to being touched.","Real competition can drive up testosterone, which boosts libido.","Women spend their lives trying to look good for men. So a woman who feels she's sending the right visual signals is pleased with herself.","Once you fall for someone, their smell can be a powerful thing. Women will wear their boyfriends' T-shirts, and throughout tales in history men have held on to their lover's handkerchief.","When you fight, anger drives up testosterone in both men and women.","I think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time, thereby conserving mating time and energy.","Almost always, when I'm on TV, the producers who call me, who negotiate what we're going to say, is a woman.","I think the happiness we find, we make.","Men want to think women don't cheat, and women want men to think they don't cheat, and therefore the sexes have been playing a little psychological game with each other.","Women, it turns out, are built to lead - particularly in the modern world.","You size up someone physically in less than one second - too tall, too short, too fat, too thin, too old, too young, too stuffy, too scruffy.","Women are very attracted to a low voice because it's linked to testosterone, which for millions of years was a sign that men had very good spacial skills and would have been very good at hunting and finding their way back home.","Saliva has testosterone and estrogen. When you kiss, you're having a chemical experience.","There's more than one person on the planet. When you're madly in love, that's not what you think.","I was married and divorced at 23.","I have always been interested in how you can walk into a room and there will be 40 people there and you are immediately drawn to one.","Young women today do not marry the men they met in high school, or even the one they go out with at college, because they do not need to.","There exists no culture in which adultery is unknown, no cultural device or code that extinguishes philandering.","Hair that gleams can send a clear sign that you're young and in your prime, whatever your actual age.","For men, being too put-together implies femininity.","A Rolex watch or an expensive car are the things guys often use to show status, wealth, and basic desirability.","Until recently, we regarded love as supernatural. We were willing to study the brain chemistry of fear and depression and anger but not love.","There's a lot of talk about the positive aspects of love. We as a society downplay the danger, the anxiety, and the disappointment. We romanticize romance.","Women apparently are quite drawn to men who have differences rather than similarities in their histocompatibility system. They pick it up by smell, and they can pick it up from kissing.","If we remained perpetually infatuated, we couldn't eat, sleep or work.","The human brain is built to compare; it's Darwinian to consider an alternative when one presents itself.","It's almost as if men who get tribal tattoos are trying to signal that they are dangerous, they're to be respected, and they're powerful.","Any time you choose not to hide your tattoo, you're limiting your social sphere, because they're not popular in big business.","Whether you're married or not, relationships - and the satisfaction tied to them - are extremely important for increasing men's and women's quality of life.","You don't come home from the office to spend time with another job. Hopefully you come home to someone you can have a good time with.","Barriers tend to intensify romance. It's called the 'Romeo and Juliet effect.' I call it 'frustration attraction.'","Games are the way we keep romance alive. They're based in human hardwiring. Playing hard-to-get or leaving a little to the imagination allows the woman to be wooed and appreciated and the man to be challenged and intrigued.","Blushing is thought to be linked to increased levels of norepinephrine in the brain, which may be associated with romantic feelings. It signals that we are interested and excited, which is attractive to men.","Hair that looks like it's been naturally sun-bleached makes you seem youthful, like you spend a lot of time outdoors. And that appeals to most people.","A hundred years ago, if you had a child out of marriage, you'd be a social disgrace. Today women feel comfortable enough economically and culturally to bring up a child without a recognized commitment from a man.","Despite the myth that men are less committed, they are predisposed to desire marriage.","Men fall in love faster than, and just as often as, women.","We spend our lives trying to get along with people so we can keep our jobs, keep our marriages together, so that we can raise our kids properly.","Psychologists maintain that the dizzying feeling of intense romantic love lasts only about 18 months to - at best - three years.","The brain was not built to walk into a bar, where you know nobody, and start a conversation. That's not the way humanity has courted.","When somebody leaves Match.com or Chemistry.com, they ask you why you left. One box you can check is, 'I found somebody.' Between 15 and 20 percent of people check that box.","A lot of people have been romantically in love with somebody who they feel wasn't appropriate to marry.","As societies continue to loosen their standards regarding what is appropriate female and male behavior, I think we are going to realize we have not only underestimated women, but also men.","The only people you and I are likely to know in common are people in the news - politicians, journalists and celebrities.","As social animals, we need to exchange juicy tales about someone - to connect with one another. For millions of years our forebears must have sat around the campfire, whispering about everyone they knew.","Along with our many human propensities, we evolved a huge cerebral cortex with which we make decisions.","Today, American women bear an average of 2.2 children that live to adulthood. Across most of Europe, women bear even fewer young.","As women in industrial societies join the paid workforce, they gain the economic means to depart unhappy marriages more easily.","Most of us make up our minds in the first three minutes of meeting someone whether there's a potential for a relationship.","In general, men are wired to notice obvious signs that convey interest in mating - a warm smile, for example - and ignore other subtleties, like if your lipstick is faded.","Men couldn't care less if your strands are perfectly styled and neat. In fact, he might like you more with some wildness or bedhead, since it shows you're carefree and relaxed.","As a group, anthropologists are not too fond of people who work in the business world.","Scientists know that women gravitate to men who have a different immune system from theirs.","I think you will find that with divorce will come happier remarriages."],"Helen Frankenthaler":["There are no rules. That is how art is born, how breakthroughs happen. Go against the rules or ignore the rules. That is what invention is about.","Whatever the medium, there is the difficulty, challenge, fascination and often productive clumsiness of learning a new method: the wonderful puzzles and problems of translating with new materials.","A really good picture looks as if it's happened at once. It's an immediate image.","You have to know how to use the accident, how to recognise it, how to control it, and ways to eliminate it so that the whole surface looks felt and born all at once.","I wanted things that I couldn't at times articulate.","One really beautiful wrist motion, that is synchronised with your head and heart, and you have it. It looks as if it were born in a minute.","The landscapes were in my arms as I did it.","We would sift through every inch of what it was that worked, or if it didn't, and wonder what was effective in it, in terms of paint, the subject matter, the size, the drawing.","The question of sex will take care of itself."],"Helen Gahagan":["In trying to make something new, half the undertaking lies in discovering whether it can be done. Once it has been established that it can, duplication is inevitable.","I realized that public affairs were also my affairs.","I became active in politics because I saw the possibility, if we all sat back and did nothing, of a world in which there would no longer be any stages for actors to act on.","When a marriage works, nothing on earth can take its place.","I never felt I left the stage."],"Helen Garner":["The rain began again. It fell heavily, easily, with no meaning or intention but the fulfilment of its own nature, which was to fall and fall.","It's very shocking, I think, for people caring for the dying to realise how unsaintly they feel, how much anger is mixed up with their grief. In fact, often I think the anger that they feel is a form of grief; it's a kind of raging against what's happening.","Writers seem to me to be people who need to retire from social life and do a lot of thinking about what's happened - almost to calm themselves.","That's the best thing that's ever happened to me, bar none, is having grandchildren and living by them and being part of their lives.","As in all matters involving love, which has so many different meanings, you find that the feeling that we label 'love' is not a simple feeling, it's a very complex one. Under the heading 'love' can come all sorts of rage and desperation.","I think some people wished I'd kept myself out of the book. But I kind of insist on it because I want the reader to share my engagement with the material, if you like, not pretend that I'm doing it completely intellectually.","I tell you one thing that makes me feel I haven't wasted my life, and that is I've got some grandchildren. You can't overestimate the kind of opening to the future that gives a person, I think.","People demand a lot of the justice system and they demand things that it can't deliver.","I like poking my nose into other people's lives.","Well, I'm at some kind of crossroads in my life and I don't know which way to take. It's not about money, I mean, because I'm established enough now as a writer to get a reasonable advance if I wanted to do fiction.","We were in a great, seething moment in the 1970s. There was a new Labour government and everything seemed full of hope... But, as we got older and we saw how much women's behaviour contributed to what was wrong, we stopped being able to see ourselves purely as.","The only thing that I was equipped for with my very mediocre college Arts degree was to get a job in teaching.","That's one of the things I hope that the book can do, is to restore some dignity to Joe Cinque.","Now, I - for several years while I was researching this book, I felt quite obsessed by thoughts about sentencing, punishment, how judges arrive at their decisions.","It's disturbing at my age to look at a young woman's destructive behaviour and hear the echoes of it, of one's own destructiveness in youth.","It's a terrific privilege to be able to see into somebody else's life.","I'm very disturbed by violence against women when it is violence.","I think writers are very anxious.","But there are some wounds that can never be healed.","But I now think what I was doing, in a completely unconscious way, was getting off the turf where my husband and I might be rivals. We were both working in fiction... so I look back and I see that I consciously vacated the contested ground.","At the time it seemed like a natural development of my interest in what was going on around me in society.","Janet Malcolm's probably the writer I most admire and who's most influenced me.","Courts are supposed to be places of reason. But this, of course, is a fantasy. I mean, there is reason being used as a technique. But courts, in fact, are baths of emotions.","I just... my childhood seems, when I look back, to be largely composed of reading, lying on the bed. I mean, my mother was always shouting, 'Go outside!' But she shouted it at all of us. I think I was just kind of... rather an introverted child, probably.","I think that there must be a point of self-immersion in a story that is a point of no return. You get far enough in that the story has really touched you to the core and deeply troubled you and made you unhappy and fearful, and then how do you get out of that? I'm a writer, so my way of getting out of that is to write.","While I was writing 'The Spare Room,' I thought, 'I'm going to look really bad in this book - there's no redeeming this kind of awful, ugly emotion', and I thought, 'I'm not going to change it. I'll call the character 'Helen' and admit to those feelings.' I think this is a reason why people write.","I don't believe that anything's totally invented... If you're completely inventing a story, there wouldn't be an urge to tell it.","I used to feel an obligation to invent things. I felt I was a failure because I didn't do massive great novels about Australia or the outback or something. I just don't feel that any more.","Life's fairly excruciating. Painful things happen. Every now and then, you drag yourself out of the stream and stand on the bank gasping for air. I think that's how I work.","It's much more interesting for me to think that taking a chunk of experience and mushing it up together with other things that are inventible, remembered from some other time or stolen from other people's stories... and see if I can make it into something that works, an object, a little machine that runs.","There's only one thing I know what to do, so I'm pretty much otherwise unemployable. The idea that you can make a living from exercising your only skill is wonderful. And it's wonderful to be read. It's a really exciting and happy thing to be read.","I don't understand my own sporadic collapses into passivity. Perhaps I never will.","Maybe this is pathetic, but I still dread producing a book that doesn't earn back its advance. I hate obligations that are financially foggy.","I suppose there must be idiots who dream of signing deals with publishers while fully intending to drink martinis in cool bars or ride around on skateboards. But the actual writers I know are experts in neurotic self-torture. Every page of writing is the result of a thousand tiny decisions and desperate acts of will."],"Helen George":["I've been to L.A. before, and I love the sunshine and the fact that people seem so genuinely nice and pleased to see you - which is so different from London. Maybe I'll end up so tired of smiles and helpfulness that I'll long for the rudeness and cynicism of home.","I love 'Call the Midwife'; it's an absolute gem of a programme. Filming the Christmas special and then the second series felt like going back to a boarding school that you really love and is full of friends.","I buy things through the ShopStyle app on my phone, then have them delivered to a neighbour so Oliver doesn't see them arrive. When he's out, I collect them, cut off the labels, and bury them deep in the recycling box under the wine bottles.","I love having my cards read - if you go to a proper place, they wouldn't dream of telling you anything awful that is going to happen.","I'm not sure filming a birth is as hard as actual labour, but it's a really long, arduous day!","I loved 'Truly Madly Deeply' and all those 1990s romcoms because you had great actresses like Juliet Stevenson and Emma Thompson starting out.","I love 'Girls.' The writing is so clever. I think Lena Dunham is a genius. I can't believe she writes it, directs it and stars in it. It's really exciting that a young woman has been able to achieve all of that.","I have two dogs, Lottie and Charlie.","I'm not sure you can lindy hop to 'We're All In This Together,' but I'm sure the nuns would welcome Zac Efron round for tea!"],"Helen Gurley Brown":["Good girls go to heaven, bad girls go everywhere.","Money, if it does not bring you happiness, will at least help you be miserable in comfort.","My success was not based so much on any great intelligence but on great common sense.","After you're older, two things are possibly more important than any others: health and money.","Beauty can't amuse you, but brainwork - reading, writing, thinking - can.","Never fail to know that if you are doing all the talking, you are boring somebody.","Nearly every glamorous, wealthy, successful career woman you might envy now started out as some kind of schlep.","One of the paramount reasons for staying attractive is so you can have somebody to go to bed with.","You can have your titular recognition. I'll take money and power.","You name it, we're out there with the latest and the best cutting edge."],"Helen Hayes":["Childhood is a short season.","Legends die hard. They survive as truth rarely does.","We relish news of our heroes, forgetting that we are extraordinary to somebody too.","Age is not important unless you're a cheese.","The hardest years in life are those between ten and seventy.","Everybody starts at the top, and then has the problem of staying there. Lasting accomplishment, however, is still achieved through a long, slow climb and self-discipline.","If you rest, you rust.","People who refuse to rest honorably on their laurels when they reach retirement age seem very admirable to me.","From your parents you learn love and laughter and how to put one foot before the other. But when books are opened you discover that you have wings.","Actors cannot choose the manner in which they are born. Consequently, it is the one gesture in their lives completely devoid of self-consciousness.","I cry out for order and find it only in art.","The story of a love is not important-what is important is that one is capable of love. It is perhaps the only glimpse we are permitted of eternity.","Actors work and slave and it is the color of your hair that can determine your fate in the end.","I'm leaving the screen because I don't think I am very good in the pictures and I have this beautiful dream that I'm elegant on the stage.","There's a little vanity chair that Charlie gave me the first Christmas we knew each other. I'll not be parting with that, nor our bed - the four-poster - I'll be needing that to die in.","Stardom can be a gilded slavery.","One has to grow up with good talk in order to form the habit of it.","Mere longevity is a good thing for those who watch Life from the side lines. For those who play the game, an hour may be a year, a single day's work an achievement for eternity.","Only the poet can look beyond the detail and see the whole picture.","The truth is that there is only one terminal dignity - love. And the story of a love is not important - what is important is that one is capable of love. It is perhaps the only glimpse we are permitted of eternity.","When traveling with someone, take large does of patience and tolerance with your morning coffee.","Every human being on this earth is born with a tragedy, and it isn't original sin. He's born with the tragedy that he has to grow up... a lot of people don't have the courage to do it.","The worst constructed play is a Bach fugue when compared to life.","The good die young but not always. The wicked prevail but not consistently. I am confused by life, and I feel safe within the confines of the theatre.","I'm a boss by nature. I'm bossy. I'm not imperious, but I don't really want people to curtsy low before me and back out of rooms, but I do like to run things."],"Helen Hunt Jackson":["When love is at its best, one loves so much that he cannot forget.","Bee to the blossom, moth to the flame; Each to his passion; what's in a name?","By all these lovely tokens September days are here, With summer's best of weather And autumn's best of cheer.","I shall be found with 'Indians' engraved on my brain when I am dead. A fire has been kindled within me, which will never go out.","If I can do one hundredth part for the Indian that Mrs. Stowe did for the Negro, I will be thankful.","Motherhood is priced Of God, at price no man may dare To lessen or misunderstand.","But all lost things are in the angels' keeping, Love; No past is dead for us, but only sleeping, Love; The years of Heaven with all earth's little pain Make Good Together there we can begin again, In babyhood.","The goldenrod is yellow, The corn is turning brown, The trees in apple orchards With fruit are bending down.","I know the lands are lit, with all the autumn blaze of Goldenrod.","Love has a tide!","When the baby dies, On every side Rose stranger's voices, hard and harsh and loud. The baby was not wrapped in any shroud. The mother made no sound. Her head was bowed That men's eyes might not see Her misery.","Words are less needful to sorrow than to joy.","Great loves, to the last, have pulses red; All great loves that have ever died dropped dead.","When Time is spent, Eternity begins.","On the king's gate the moss grew gray; The king came not. They call'd him dead; And made his eldest son, one day, Slave in his father's stead.","But great loves, to the last, have pulses red; All great loves that have ever died dropped dead.","O month when they who love must love and wed.","O sweet, delusive Noon, Which the morning climbs to find, O moment sped too soon, And morning left behind.","There cannot be found in the animal kingdom a bat, or any other creature, so blind in its own range of circumstance and connection, as the greater majority of human beings are in the bosoms of their families.","As soon as I began, it seemed impossible to write fast enough - I wrote faster than I would write a letter - two thousand to three thousand words in a morning, and I cannot help it.","There is nothing so skillful in its own defense as imperious pride.","If I could write a story that would do for the Indian one-hundredth part what 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' did for the Negro, I would be thankful the rest of my life."],"Helen Hunt":["It's getting too late in my life to care about the small things. It's getting too late to not be brave, to not live my life fully, to not try to be an artist. Trivial things like how nice your hotel room is, or if you have to be naked for a while, they fade away.","I usually don't read things written about me and I certainly don't read things if they are inappropriate.","I've worked for a long time, but I got to the point where I felt like, I am out here so far, how do I get back? I want to have a real life, a personal life. I didn't want a personal life I just visited.","Movie acting is a great job for your twenties: You travel all over, you have affairs with people, and you throw yourself into one part and then another. It gets more challenging as you get older, and it's not just having a daughter, it's wanting to have your own life and be yourself.","I don't wish I started later, but I was never a child star. I was in school every year and had normal friends and I loved it and here I am, so I can't say that I wish I hadn't done it. I used to say, 'No, I didn't miss any of my childhood,' but it is a very adult place to be, a movie set. Like, it's a little weird.","When you first entered the restaurant, I thought you were handsome... and then, of course, you spoke.","You have five seconds to enjoy it and then you remember who you didn't thank.","I think that all of us are 5-year-olds and we don't want to be embarrassed in the schoolyard.","I wanted to have a personal life that I fully inhabited, not because I am such a great mom, but for me.","I've been offered a couple of shows that have been very successful, but they weren't right for me. It has to be something I could be excited about for a long time.","The Oscar sits on some shelf above my desk. If there was an earthquake, I could actually be killed by my own Academy Award.","I know for me the subject of how to be in a relationship is precious and complicated and challenging.","I do eat well. I try to love my body. That is what I tell my daughter. I say, 'Love every bite of food. Love your body. We're all going to be dead soon.' Actually I don't say that last thing to her.","We all feel disabled in some way. We all feel imperfect. It's hard to be looked at for various reasons.","I haven't watched anything I've been in since I've done it. I have never put in a movie at home that I've been in. Why? I don't know. I would feel like Norma Desmond. And I have a kid, so time is at a premium.","I loved Julia Louis-Dreyfus's show 'The New Adventures of Old Christine.' That made me laugh out loud. She's like Lucille Ball. She's brilliant.","But the truth is I wanted to have my daughter for so long. It's not the kind of thing you can visit, motherhood. Especially in the early years. Now she's eight, and I'm still not going to go anywhere.","It's very healing to me to be a very present mother. I hope that it's also good for her. But it's definitely good for me.","I'm taking a philosophy class and regretting it with everything in me. I'm taking one college class per semester. Philosophy is studying what you already know and dismantling it. I thought it would be right up my alley. I can't tell you how much it's not me.","I have to say, my celebrity is not a big factor in my life. Once in a while someone takes my picture. But I'm not exactly one of the four girls everyone's chasing at the moment.","The best movies have one sentence that they're exploring, a thesis, something that people can argue about over dinner afterward.","You either have a baby, want a baby, or don't want a baby, but you don't nothing a baby if you're in your 30s or 40s.","I've made choices that work with my family. I want to work and I want to be with my family so I just walk the tight-rope of showing up for both those things.","I know you're always supposed to want more of everything. But in truth, I'm having a nice ebb and flow of being in my daughter's life every day and getting to keep my work life alive. I'm not nominated for ten thousand everythings every minute, but I am acting and telling stories I love.","I actually have a life I said I wanted to have. I wanted to tell stories I want and be with my family. I'm whispering it, because I'm a quarter Jewish and afraid it's all going to be taken away.","I've always had to force myself to make friends and speak to people. My parents were quiet, and it took me a while to get used to the fact that people talk about their feelings, their problems.","I worked before I had my daughter, enough for three actresses.","I think if my daughter was interested in acting, I would find ways for her to act in theater that has to do with her school or a kids' improvisational thing. There are ways to do it where you're not on a movie set with 60 adults, which I loved at the time, but as a parent, I don't know that I'd be dying to put her in that spot.","I think I have more of a director's brain than an actor's brain, in a way.","I think that all of us are 5-year-olds and we don't want to be embarrassed in the schoolyard. I've gone through things in my life. People say it must be so hard to do it in the public eye, but the truth is, when you go through hard things, it's just hard."],"Helen Johnson-Leipold":["The Great Recession rocked the foundation of every financial institution, including Johnson Bank. We were struggling, and it was happening under my watch.","There are so many issues, so many opportunities to bring people together who have different perspectives, to develop action plans, and to have a significant impact on those issues.","The outdoor recreational industry is highly seasonal and heavily influenced by weather conditions.","Strong succession planning is a critical element of all the Johnson enterprises.","It's important to understand economic trends, but, in my mind, it's more important to understand how to buck the trends.","As a former member of JWA's management team, and more recently as a director, I am delighted to have the opportunity now to take the reins of leadership of the company. I look forward to working with JWA's management team to chart the course and execute the plan to further strengthen and broaden JWA's leading product franchises.","Without trust, no organization can sustain innovation because without trust, no one is willing to take the risks that innovation requires."],"Helen Keller":["The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must be felt with the heart.","Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.","Walking with a friend in the dark is better than walking alone in the light.","Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see a shadow.","Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved.","Never bend your head. Always hold it high. Look the world straight in the eye.","So long as the memory of certain beloved friends lives in my heart, I shall say that life is good.","Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.","The only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision.","Life is either a great adventure or nothing.","The highest result of education is tolerance.","We could never learn to be brave and patient, if there were only joy in the world.","What we have once enjoyed we can never lose. All that we love deeply becomes a part of us.","Although the world is full of suffering, it is also full of the overcoming of it.","Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing.","Love is like a beautiful flower which I may not touch, but whose fragrance makes the garden a place of delight just the same.","Faith is the strength by which a shattered world shall emerge into the light.","What I am looking for is not out there, it is in me.","Life is an exciting business, and most exciting when it is lived for others.","Until the great mass of the people shall be filled with the sense of responsibility for each other's welfare, social justice can never be attained.","The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched, they must be felt with the heart.","All the world is full of suffering. It is also full of overcoming.","We can do anything we want to if we stick to it long enough.","The most pathetic person in the world is someone who has sight, but has no vision.","No pessimist ever discovered the secret of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new doorway for the human spirit.","Once I knew only darkness and stillness... my life was without past or future... but a little word from the fingers of another fell into my hand that clutched at emptiness, and my heart leaped to the rapture of living.","One can never consent to creep when one feels an impulse to soar.","It is a terrible thing to see and have no vision.","True happiness... is not attained through self-gratification, but through fidelity to a worthy purpose.","Of all the senses, sight must be the most delightful.","Knowledge is love and light and vision.","I long to accomplish a great and noble task, but it is my chief duty to accomplish small tasks as if they were great and noble.","It is for us to pray not for tasks equal to our powers, but for powers equal to our tasks, to go forward with a great desire forever beating at the door of our hearts as we travel toward our distant goal.","Your success and happiness lies in you. Resolve to keep happy, and your joy and you shall form an invincible host against difficulties.","No one has a right to consume happiness without producing it.","To me a lush carpet of pine needles or spongy grass is more welcome than the most luxurious Persian rug.","When we do the best that we can, we never know what miracle is wrought in our life, or in the life of another.","Toleration is the greatest gift of the mind; it requires the same effort of the brain that it takes to balance oneself on a bicycle.","Literature is my Utopia. Here I am not disenfranchised. No barrier of the senses shuts me out from the sweet, gracious discourses of my book friends. They talk to me without embarrassment or awkwardness.","While they were saying among themselves it cannot be done, it was done.","As the eagle was killed by the arrow winged with his own feather, so the hand of the world is wounded by its own skill.","There is no king who has not had a slave among his ancestors, and no slave who has not had a king among his.","Smell is a potent wizard that transports you across thousands of miles and all the years you have lived.","Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness. It is not attained through self-gratification but through fidelity to a worthy purpose.","The world is moved along, not only by the mighty shoves of its heroes, but also by the aggregate of tiny pushes of each honest worker.","The heresy of one age becomes the orthodoxy of the next.","Many people know so little about what is beyond their short range of experience. They look within themselves - and find nothing! Therefore they conclude that there is nothing outside themselves either.","Everything has its wonders, even darkness and silence, and I learn, whatever state I may be in, therein to be content.","Instead of comparing our lot with that of those who are more fortunate than we are, we should compare it with the lot of the great majority of our fellow men. It then appears that we are among the privileged.","We may have found a cure for most evils; but we have found no remedy for the worst of them all, the apathy of human beings.","The marvelous richness of human experience would lose something of rewarding joy if there were no limitations to overcome. The hilltop hour would not be half so wonderful if there were no dark valleys to traverse.","Self-pity is our worst enemy and if we yield to it, we can never do anything wise in this world.","Science may have found a cure for most evils; but it has found no remedy for the worst of them all - the apathy of human beings.","It is not possible for civilization to flow backwards while there is youth in the world. Youth may be headstrong, but it will advance it allotted length.","As selfishness and complaint pervert the mind, so love with its joy clears and sharpens the vision.","Unless we form the habit of going to the Bible in bright moments as well as in trouble, we cannot fully respond to its consolations because we lack equilibrium between light and darkness.","It is wonderful how much time good people spend fighting the devil. If they would only expend the same amount of energy loving their fellow men, the devil would die in his own tracks of ennui.","College isn't the place to go for ideas.","It's wonderful to climb the liquid mountains of the sky. Behind me and before me is God and I have no fears.","It is hard to interest those who have everything in those who have nothing.","I can see, and that is why I can be happy, in what you call the dark, but which to me is golden. I can see a God-made world, not a manmade world.","People do not like to think. If one thinks, one must reach conclusions. Conclusions are not always pleasant.","I do not want the peace which passeth understanding, I want the understanding which bringeth peace.","My share of the work may be limited, but the fact that it is work makes it precious.","Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. The fearful are caught as often as the bold.","Death is no more than passing from one room into another. But there's a difference for me, you know. Because in that other room I shall be able to see.","What a blind person needs is not a teacher but another self.","I seldom think about my limitations, and they never make me sad. Perhaps there is just a touch of yearning at times; but it is vague, like a breeze among flowers.","Strike against war, for without you no battles can be fought!","No matter how dull, or how mean, or how wise a man is, he feels that happiness is his indisputable right."],"Helen McCrory":["I'm a very positive person. My grandmother taught me that happiness is both a skill and a decision, and you are responsible for the outcome.","I feel as though my life is bathed in golden sunlight. And the really wonderful thing is that I know it.","Appallingly, I hadn't thought about it one jot. I never daydreamed as a little girl of getting married and having children. I was as surprised to discover I was getting married as I was to discover I was up the duff.","If you think you are beautiful in a scene, you will come across as beautiful. I don't think looks are important; I think what's important is if someone is sexy.","I love live performance and have huge admiration for people who can really do it. It's the same with music: I'll play a record and think that I'm not really into country or ragga. But, if it's live and the musicians are good, I'll listen to pretty much anything.","A perfect weekend in London has to start on Friday night, by going to the theatre, the Donmar or the National. It's a cliche for an actor, but I enjoy going as much as possible.","I really love my food. My favourite thing is artichokes. I am not so much interested in desserts or chocolate, though. I also like to cook with my husband Damian.","Actually, I'm looking forward to being 50. Because to me, that's when a woman is at the pinnacle of her femininity and her womanhood.","People are not considerate of others. They tend not to consider themselves as all living together, but see themselves only as individuals.","I was lucky to learn early in life that you need money for food and shelter, but there's no ambition in having money in the bank for the sake of it!","Theatre is liberating because it only works if it's truthful - that's what it requires. That's not true of film: the camera does lie.","You can be moved by a performance on set, but when you see it on screen, it does nothing. Yet there will be someone you simply didn't notice on set that on screen: bam!","The benefits of feminism for someone like my husband are fantastic. He can stay at home with the kids, he can take them to a park, he does the school run.","I think I was brought up with an innate sense of responsibility because my dad was in the Foreign Office where you were in somebody else's country, and you were aware of your behaviour. And my mum worked for the NHS, so you were aware of your responsibility to your country.","I think it's very important not to grow up with the unhealthy amount of attention that is sometimes put on people because they are 'actors'.","I love dressing up. But I'm very low-maintenance; the week before an event, I'll choose something as quickly as possible and that's that. If I can do my own hair and make-up, even better. I like it to be fun.","As I've got older, I feel more confident in my body, so wouldn't want to tamper with it.","I can sleep anywhere! I can come off stage during the interval of a play, lie down for four minutes then wake up feeling better.","Literature is reflecting what is happening in life. More and more women are having relationships with younger men. It's partly that women are not losing their figures now.","People who are exceptionally intelligent are often lonely because there are few people as intelligent as them. I have two little children, and everyone says: 'I hope they're doing well in school. I hope they're bright.' And I think: 'Why would anyone want their children to be the brightest?' Academia is a lonely world.","I've become more confident as I have got older. I care less what others think.","I used to say that theatre was my favourite thing. But the more I do film, the more I appreciate it.","What I find most interesting about acting is transforming myself.","America is such a nation of suppressed emotion, and when you arrive in L.A., you can smell the fear. It's the most alien country I've ever been to.","If you're constantly frightened of being unhappy, how bloody exhausting must that be?","What interests me about life most is people, and the why of the world. That's what theatre looks at: it examines life, and gives it a cohesiveness that life doesn't have.","When I was 14, I told my mother I intended to be in the House of Commons in the morning, in court in the afternoon and on stage in the evening. She realised then a fantasist had been born.","I was very lucky. I left college, and Richard Eyre was in charge of the National Theatre. I was offered the lead in 'The Seagull' with no experience and went on to do five plays there.","You don't learn from good people - they've found what works for them and are completely original; you learn from the people who are bad. You think: 'Oh dear, I'm not going to do that.'","I had a great start in television; the first thing I did was an episode of 'Performance' called 'The Entertainer' with Michael Gambon playing Archie Rice.","Working in films, there are hundreds of odd moments.","I use my awards as doorstops. Others are in the office or in little cubbyholes in our library - they go between the books, because they actually look like arty pieces.","I was a real art freak when I was a teenager.","It's what people create that makes my heart stop.","In the area we live, there's a large show of children who run from one house to another house to another house. That's lovely because it means all the children play together, and all the adults get to sit around and have coffees and read the papers or go to the park.","The only time I ever spend alone is when I am working or when my husband is away filming. I put the kids to bed and have an hour and a half in the evening for myself.","I listen to Radio 4 all the time. I didn't go to university, so that's my further education.","To be honest, my husband and my children are my best friends.","My own parents were very un-neurotic, so I never thought that I had to change enormously in order to become a parent.","Childhood has definitely been invented, hasn't it? I think that's because people had children later, and we appreciate and cherish childhood a lot more.","There are a lot of little lessons that can be taught around the home without sitting a child down and boring them to death with your philosophy of life!","I think change is good because it teaches you that it's nothing to be frightened of.","I've often sat down with people talking about a film I've been in, and they haven't realised I was in it.","What really matters to me is what my peers think.","I love theatre because it's just me and the audience. It's the litmus test in acting, to be able to sustain a performance over one, two or three hours.","A script is only as good as the director who's making it.","If I were in politics, I'd make both left and right sit down and make good decisions about national health. It's a huge problem, and it is something we all should be part of.","Every time, at any point of my life, I think now is always the best age to be.","So often when you meet child actors, they're weird - they're freaks. No, I mean it, they're really odd people.","I spent my teenage years in Paris when my dad was stationed there, and I'd look at women in their forties and think, 'That's the age I want to be.'","I love London, and it's a privilege for my children to grow up here."],"Helen Mirren":["I don't believe that if you do good, good things will happen. Everything is completely accidental and random. Sometimes bad things happen to very good people and sometimes good things happen to bad people. But at least if you try to do good things, then you're spending your time doing something worthwhile.","I have never in my life found myself in a situation where I've stopped work and said, 'Thank God it's Friday.' But weekends are special even if your schedule is all over the place. Something tells you the weekend has arrived and you can indulge yourself a bit.","You write your life story by the choices you make. You never know if they have been a mistake. Those moments of decision are so difficult.","I'll tell you what me scares me is plastic. Plastic bags and plastic bottles and these things. Why does my water have to be in a bloody plastic bottle? The landfill and the ocean. And I don't know, I'm just terrified with the proliferation of plastic.","There's no good way to waste your time. Wasting time is just wasting time.","It's great to be queen!","I was never that kind of star. I was never cast because I was gorgeous.","Two phrases I hate in reference to female characters are 'strong' and 'feisty.' They really annoy me. It's the most condescending thing. You say that about a three-year-old. It infantilises women.","The whole thing of clothes is insane. You can spend a dollar on a jacket in a thrift store. And you can spend a thousand dollars on a jacket in a shop. And if you saw those two jackets walking down the street, you probably wouldn't know which was which.","I love photography, and I love the art of photography.","I'm not a republican any more. Not so voraciously anyway - I'm not in favour of the concept of monarchy, but I do see the good in it if there's a good person in the role.","Working away from my husband for long periods is good and bad. It stops us taking each other for granted and gives us space, but I miss him terribly.","I'd like to see a much more open Monarchy, myself. I used to think they were completely useless and we should get rid of them. I don't necessarily feel that way anymore. I'm still ambivalent, I still loathe the British class system, and the Royal family are the apex of the British class system.","Gardening is learning, learning, learning. That's the fun of them. You're always learning.","I don't like the word 'strong,' because a strong character is never an interesting character. A character is made interesting by their vulnerabilities and their weaknesses.","When you're young, you wonder what all these old people are droning on about, trying to impart their wisdom. It's not relevant to you because being young is such a specific thing. Thank God for that. Thank God for the young people who go out and demonstrate against rampant capitalism or whatever.","The great marriages are partnerships. It can't be a great marriage without being a partnership.","The most important thing is to bring people with Parkinson's into our world and for the public to have a real understanding of it, as they're beginning to have with autism.","I still have a Gypsy sense of adventure. I don't think I have slept in the same bed for more than three or four months my whole life. I am always planting vegetables that I never get to eat and flowers that I never see flower. I have always moved around the world.","I drink just as much tea when I'm in Los Angeles as I do when I'm in London. I take my tea bags with me wherever I go.","I am not too keen on my nose, I don't like my knees, I hate my ankles, I am unsure about my behind, I don't like my legs at all. I am not too sure about my chin, my forehead is a bit dodgy. But, overall, I can live with it.","At the time of the Silver Jubilee, I was a grumpy anti-monarchist. I didn't celebrate and was appalled by the celebrations. In my idiocy, I missed out! I feel completely differently now compared with that time.","I'm under the impression that this notion of decency is disappearing from our society where conflicts are made worse on cinema and on television, where people are nasty and cruel on the Internet and where, in general, everybody seems to be very angry.","The control and understanding of our personal fears is one of the most important undertakings of our lives.","It'll be the Internet and piracy that will kill film. There's a philosophy that the Internet should be free, but the reality is that piracy will destroy the film industry and film as an art form because it's expensive to make a movie. Maybe you'll have funky little independent movies, and it'll go back and then start up again some other way.","When you're 16, 30 seems ancient. When you're 30, 45 seems ancient. When you're 45, 60 seems ancient. When you're 60, nothing seems ancient.","The role of women has always been undervalued in the spy world, always undermined in terms of recognition. Unfairly so. It's a world that needs women.","Hollywood is a very small world; the people who matter matter, and the people who don't matter are just like nothing.","There is that awful moment when you realize that you're falling in love. That should be the most joyful moment, and actually it's not. It's always a moment that's full of fear because you know, as night follows day, the joy is going to rapidly be followed by some pain or other. All the angst of a relationship.","Actors are rogues and vagabonds. Or they ought to be.","The trick in life is learning how to deal with it.","I think we all have a dream of what it would be like not to work and grow heirloom tomatoes, and I do have that dream. It would be lovely. I do love gardening and all of that, but I do love my work.","Sometimes nudity is sexy. Sometimes it's not. Sometimes being clothed is more sexy than being nude.","I am quite spiritual. I believed in the fairies when I was a child. I still do sort of believe in the fairies. And the leprechauns. But I don't believe in God.","Wherever I am in the world, if I get free time when I'm filming I always hire a car, take to the road, drive for miles and explore.","People often ask me whether I prefer theater or film, and the answer is that I prefer the one I'm not doing: The grass is always greener.","I still suffer terribly from stage fright. I get sick with fear. Not every night, but at the beginning and on occasion - not necessarily when I'm expecting it. You just have to cope with it - take it on the chin and work through it, trying to use the adrenalin to perform.","Parkinson's is a slow but inevitable process. It's hard living with it on a daily basis. The difficulty facing people with it is that they never quite know 'Can I or can't I do this today?'","Painters hate having to explain what their work is about. They always say, 'It's whatever you want it to be' - because I think that's their intention, to connect with each person's subconscious, and not to try and dictate.","Where you grew up becomes a big part of who you are for the rest of your life. You can't run away from that. Well, sometimes the running away from it is what makes you who you are.","I don't share lots of the phobias that horror movies tap into. I don't mind spiders or snakes or darkness.","Any role that's proactive is a great role, and action roles are by their very nature proactive. You get to do stuff. I hate sitting in a corner - I'd much prefer an action role in a popcorn movie rather than pining in a corner not doing anything.","I've always been battling against my sense of dignity and refinement. I was embarrassed by any bodily functions when I was younger. I could never even blow my nose.","Humor in a relationship is so important. Many women will say that. Some say, 'If they can make you laugh, it's the sexiest thing on earth.'","My parents believed in education and economic security, and I thank them for it. Because I think that's part of what's made my life stable. It was instilled in me. You have to be able to pay your bills. You do not get into debt. And I never have been.","I think a lot of my work has been a weird attempt to liberate myself, but it's not altogether successful.","I learned quite early on in life that we are all two people. And one of those people none of us will ever know.","People with Parkinson's are not some weird people on the edge of human experience.","I prefer the finesse of French humour. English humour is more scathing, more cruel, as illustrated by Monty Python and Little Britain.","I have to say, without sounding like a total tosser, that everything I've learned in life, and that has taken me out of my natural interior life, has been with men. They exposed me to things that I wasn't aware of. I learned from all the guys.","All you have to do is to look like crap on film and everyone thinks you're a brilliant actress. Actually, all you've done is look like crap.","Flesh sells. People don't want to see pictures of churches. They want to see naked bodies.","There's nothing sexy about doing a nude scene. It's rather uncomfortable. I like dressing up rather than dressing down.","We're all idiots when we're young. We don't think we are, but we are. So we should be.","I think of myself as being a bit of a wimp deep down - a bourgeois wimp - and I'm fighting that. I think all Brits are, maybe.","I was never a left-winger, actually. I was a pretend left-winger because it was more interesting than being a right-winger.","I resent having witnessed the survival of some very mediocre male actors and the professional demise of the very brilliant female ones.","Girls go out together to see a chick flick or something. I loathe, I hate, chick flicks.","The whole 'R' rating depends on a strange sort of fantasy land where all adults are responsible people, and children only ever go to the cinema with their parents.","It was never my intention to marry anybody. Economics are basically the only reason to get married, but I'm very glad I did it.","I don't get to play the same role over and over in different movies. The roles that I get to play are quite varied, which is great.","They're called 'action scenes' because they do the acting for you. You don't have to act in action scenes. The action does it all for you. It's great.","My dad's Russian. My mother's English. I would say my bottom half is Russian.","American actors who voice animated movies are so brilliant at it, because by the nature of American speak, it's full of energy and full of commitment. And as a British actor, we have to kind of learn that.","I'd describe myself as a Christian who doesn't believe in God.","I can't help being Christian because I was brought up in Britain, and the morality of Christianity is part of the fabric of this country.","It's a mystery, that thing about chemistry, because often people who hate each other in real life and hate each other on the set have great chemistry on the screen. And people who love each other in real life and love each other on the set have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever.","When you do a voice in an animated film, you don't see the finished product at all. You're not animating. You're not doing the voice on the finished product. You're doing the voice long before.","I'm terrified of learning lines, and I've always been terrified that I won't learn them.","I have done film, television and theatre - all at a pretty substantial level - I don't think it's possible for American actors to do that.","There's a scary moment when you realise you're no longer the youngest person in the room. Especially if you've been a successful young person. That's followed, of course, by the realisation that you're actually the oldest person in the room.","I believe kids shouldn't be taught Shakespeare. They should experience it first by seeing a great production.","I was part of the first generation of girls and women to be educated and go to grammar school even if we didn't have much money. Then that generation went, 'OK, great', and went into medicine or the police, and hit this wall of discrimination from older men who hadn't caught up.","I believe in meditation - it's a good tool to centre yourself, but unfortunately, I'm too lazy to do it. It's very hard work, and I prefer to watch 'Nothing To Declare' on TV!","I have no maternal instinct whatsoever. Motherhood holds no interest for me.","I remember thinking, when I was in my early 30s, that this is the best age to be, and I still believe your 30s are a wonderful time.","Nothing is quite so emotional and passionate as what goes on inside of a family. People are driven to distraction by a father or a mother or a husband. Or a child.","It's so hard when you're young to look at older people and understand that they have been where you are. It's the weirdest thing. You just can't get your head around that, can you? You can't get your head around the fact that someone who is 60 was once 16, if you're 16. But the fact is they have been, and they remember it.","I always love working with young actors, because there's always something to learn. It's always exciting to see the next generation and how they approach things and what's great about them and what's not so great about them.","I met with Hitchcock when I was a very, very young actress just starting out and he was making 'Frenzy' in London and I was sent along to meet with him. He was very, very unimpressed with me and I have to say, I was rather unimpressed with him - but only because I was an arrogant, ignorant young actress.","I'm not strong-willed, actually. I'm a complete pushover. I love to be told what to do.","I've always found as an actress that the best thing to do in film or TV or theater is just to lose yourself in it. Think of the story, the character, the worlds we're in, and forget everything else.","I do think it's well over-time to have a female Doctor Who. I think a gay, black female Doctor Who would be the best of all.","What's great in the modern world is that it's becoming easier and easier for people to create without having access to large sums of money. They need access to certain technologies, but the cost is far less than it used to be.","I love men that love women. Morgan Freeman, who I worked with on 'RED,' was very flattering to me. But he is flattering to all women. He is a woman-charmer.","I am British. I love Britain for all its faults and all its virtues. My husband is American and I am largely based in Los Angeles, but whenever someone asks me where home is, I automatically say 'London.'","I am in a fabulously lucky position in that I get to wear beautiful, beautiful gowns for functions, which I can then give back. That way, they're not sitting in my wardrobe with me looking at them and feeling guilty. I love that, and I think when people have a fabulous function to go to, I'd recommend renting.","I don't think it's good to try and change anyone. The trick and the mystery - of relationships and life in general - is to learn to live with the bits you don't like.","I've been working every year since I started acting, and I got many awards before I won the Oscar for 'The Queen.'","I can't say 'no' to an interesting role. I always tell my husband, 'That's it, I quit, I've done all I wanted,' and he's just like, 'Yeah, yeah. Sure.'","I am so happy that I didn't have children. Well, you know, because I've had freedom. And I've so loved my freedom.","When I came into the acting profession, it was quite hierarchical. You didn't sit at the same table as the leading actor. Sir Laurence Olivier, Sir John Gielgud... these were very, very intimidating and powerful people.","The poor Oscars - they always get slammed in the press.","I think every woman in our culture is a feminist. They may refuse to articulate it, but if you were to take any woman back 40 years and say, 'Is this a world you want to live in?' They would say, 'No.'","When you're young and beautiful, you're paranoid and miserable.","There isn't a King Lear for women, or a Henry V, or a Richard III. You reach a level where you can handle that stuff technically and mentally, and it's not there.","When women get great roles in life, they start to get great roles in films and TV. Look at Janet Reno, Madeleine Albright, and Mrs. Thatcher. Because those images are coming at us in life, they are reflected in acting.","I'm not a communist, of course. But I do think that everything is down to economics. Capitalism doesn't change.","I couldn't handle the rules the Queen has to live by at all, and very few of us could. It's a golden cage, really. You're never alone in that role - you are always surrounded by security.","I think it's always hard for people to get their head around the fact that populist, commercial films can also actually be great works of art.","People become more interesting from about 25 - they develop character and their personalities come out.","Everyone wants to be a movie star or a model, to be in the papers, but few realise just what hard work it is, getting up early, and so on.","Patience can be a good thing - but not necessarily. Sometimes it's not so bad to be impatient. I'm a little bit too polite.","You can't control how other people see you or think of you. But you have to be comfortable with that.","I don't throw a lot of parties. I find throwing parties a bit intimidating.","I'm not an impersonator. I'm a lousy impersonator, actually."],"Helen Oyeyemi":["Dickinson is my hero because she was a joker, because she would never explain, because as a poet she confronted pain, dread and death, and because she was capable of speaking of those matters with both levity and seriousness. She's my hero because she was a metaphysical adventurer.","The way that people feel changes everything. Feelings are forces. They cause us to time travel. And to leave ourselves, to leave our bodies. I would be that kind of psychologist who says, 'You're absolutely right - there are monsters under the bed.'","I don't feel there's a difference between the real world and the fairy-tale world. They contain psychological truths and, I guess, projections of what the culture that tells them thinks about various things: men, women, aging, dying - the most basic aspects of being human.","I do love Shirley Jackson, but I don't deserve to be named in connection with her. I remember reading 'The Haunting of Hill House' and having goosebumps for hours. The way she builds narrative pressure in that book is just amazing. I think you could reread it a few times and actually go out of your mind.","The first book I really loved was 'Little Women' - I'd have given anything for Beth to have been allowed to live; I remember crying very much over her death, trying to make the words change just by staring at them. I loved 'Anne of Green Gables,' too; 'What Katy Did;' and 'Peter Pan.'","I take aliens very seriously and don't appreciate light entertainment or weak approximations being made of them.","I can recommend wearing blue mascara whilst writing. I'm telling you, it really adds something.","I sometimes get asked: 'How come the men in your stories don't have such strong characters?' And I'm like: 'I don't care.' I just want to find out about all the different lives a woman can live. But my feminism has never been against men. It's not erasure; it's just they're not the focus. In real life, they're quite nice.","I do tend to feel more connected to dead writers, perhaps because they have finished their work.","I love character and voice, and my favourite books have been the ones in which I've become completely absorbed.","Sometimes I feel weird about time. Sometimes I feel that it doesn't go in the order we perceive it. There are... repetitions that maybe we decide not to notice because it is simpler. I like to pick up on those moments.","I don't have a style. I just try to write what the story demands.","The way I live now is that I only write, which means that I'm very poor but very happy. Everything in my life is the way I want it to be.","I remember that I used to get lots of books from the library, and 'Little Women' was one of them. And I used to just cross out the parts of it that really upset me because it's such a sad book in so many ways. I'd cross out the parts that upset me, and I would rewrite new endings.","In my family, telling stories is just a way of life.","I think I started writing about identity, and I used to believe that identity is the story. But now I'm not so much subscribed to that. I mean, with 'Mr. Fox,' it has a feminist agenda as well. And so, as I sort of been away from writing about identity, I still feel that kind of tug of roots and, you know, cultural background.","I was a real mess at school. I got a bit of a reputation for being the weird girl: the girl who'd go silent randomly and just kind of write down replies to people's questions in a book.","I've always felt happy in my own company. It's only when I get around other people that things get sticky.","I think, basically, what I'm good for is reading - a lot. I think I'll always be more of a reader than a writer, definitely. There are sooo many books in the world I haven't read, sometimes I feel as if they're all piled on top of my head weighing me down and saying, 'Hurry up.'","I love taking things out of context and playing with them and chopping up rules.","A few people have tried to make me see that my writing isn't quite their thing by saying to me: 'What about realism?' To which my general response is, 'What about it?' However, I wouldn't be at all surprised if one of my favorite writers, Marilynne Robinson, was to say something similar if asked 'What about the fantastic?'","Authors I've longed to write like - but realize I actually can't even begin to - include Poe, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Kafka, Daniil Kharms, Witold Gombrowicz, Emily Dickinson, Robert Walser, Barbara Comyns, Ntozake Shange, Camille Laurens, Zbigniew Herbert, and Jose Saramago.","Home is where your teapots are.","I'm greedy about cities - I like to form my impressions of them on my own, and on foot as far as possible, looking and listening, having conversations with bridges and streets and riverbanks, conversations I tend not to be aware of until a little later, when I find myself returning to those places to say hello again, even if only in memory.","I always wanted to be a writer! But I wanted to do other things, too - be a psychologist, a librarian, et cetera. Now I've decided that reading fiction that features characters who are in those professions will do.","Years ago a friend and fellow writer, Nick Antosca, once made a remark about it being best not to threaten, but to simply act. An effective way of going about things, I think.","I don't despise 'Don Quixote,' but it is a book I don't... get. I'll have to come back it. Maybe there'll be a gateway story that opens it up for me; that happened for me with 'Paradise Lost' and the 'His Dark Materials' trilogy.","The way 'The Icarus Girl' came about was by me just basically bragging it with a literary agent and telling him I'd written 150 pages when I'd only written 20. And I think it was when the agent e-mailed me back right the very next day after sending him the 20 pages and asking to see the other 130.","So many times I've encountered people who are just kind of like, 'Yeah, Nigeria,' and, you know, thump their chest and seem very sure of, like, being Nigerian. And I'm just kind of, like, I wish I could be that sure.","I don't think anything can help me socially, to be honest: I have this terrible personality. I don't really know how to describe it... maybe I'll go with surly.","Fairy tales, because they have a very clear structure, are easier to interfere with. Also they have this really weird logic: the kind of logic that you only really experience when you're not feeling very well, or as a child.","I don't think my writing has much to do with my age. For me, my biography is more about what I was reading at what age. It's more of an intellectual thing of wanting to be free to write and think without being too bound by categorisation. I don't think I'm made for these times; I feel more like an old-fashioned writer.","I feel like an old lady; my hero is Miss Marple.","I have been in love with Emily Dickinson's poetry since I was 13, and, like an anonymous post on findagrave.com says, 'Dear Emily - I hope I have understood.' Emily's poems are sometimes difficult, often abstract, on occasion flippant, but her mind is inside them.","The more forcibly I'm made aware of the fact that I'll never be the kind of storyteller I most admire, the less I'll be troubled by that. I'll probably just become more myself.","I tend to prioritize emotional realism above the known laws of time and space, and when you do that, it's inevitable that strange things happen. Which can be quite enjoyable, I think."],"Helen Prejean":["Allowing our government to kill citizens compromises the deepest moral values upon which this country was conceived: the inviolable dignity of human persons.","The important thing is that when you come to understand something you act on it, no matter how small that act is. Eventually it will take you where you need to go."],"Helen Reddy":["I am woman, hear me roar.","If I have to, I can do anything. I am strong, I am invincible, I am Woman.","Hindsight is wonderful. It's always very easy to second guess after the fact.","Believe it or not, most people think of me as a recording artist, but actually the way I think of myself and the way I earn my living is as a performing artist.","I like music to soothe me.","I don't know if it's a sign of all the chaos that is happening out there or not, but I've lately craved the structure and order of classical music, the balance and symmetry.","I wanted control over the merchandising, the actual packaging of the product. That was a big factor. The only way for me to exercise control on all those levels was to start my own label.","I did my own music videos, my own TV commercials.","I've been in a serious conversation with one of my children, and a fan has come up. I've been in a public bathroom and had the hand come under the stall with a paper and pen. That sort of thing anybody can live without.","I'm a very private person, and when I leave the stage, I leave the stage.","I always believed that I could make it or I would never have spent so many years trying to get here.","It took me a year to really learn the American lingo. I really feel for people who are coming here and don't speak English at all. It must be hell.","Most of the people I know in show business don't need anybody pushing them at all. They're extremely aggressive.","I had a career for 25 years in Australia before I ever came to the United States.","My audience are the same people who bought my albums years ago. These people are now married, with their own homes, their own families. If I'm in concert, I get people now who bring their kids.","My audience is the baby-boomers, the bulk of the population. This is also a group that is being ignored by most record companies because they're not the Top 40 hit singles market. They forget these people still listen to music.","There is a wealth of twentieth century music that is being re-discovered by a generation that hasn't heard it.","Please don't ask me any questions about the politics of 30 years ago.","To this day I get mail from women who say, I went to law school because of your song. But I would hate to think out of the wide spectrum of things I have done in my career, that's all I would be remembered for.","I worked with my parents on the stage in production numbers since I was 4, but I never really gave much thought to being a performer on my own until I was 12 or 13.","I was very strongly influenced by women's magazines and I really believed tha a woman could not be married and raise a family and have a successful career all at the same time.","I was looking for a husband, but meanwhile to survive, I had to work.","I couldn't do anything. I'd work in a department store for a couple of weeks, but I couldn't hack it. I couldn't even type! I had no skills whatsoever outside of show business.","If you tell people your ambitions, they usually laugh at you. When I told my girlfriends when I was 12 that I was going to Hollywood, they all laughed. And here I am!","I think back and marvel that my ambitions were so small.","It took so long to make it in America. The year I arrived was a bad year for women singers, the record company told me. So I starved. I lived in a hotel so dreadful I can't even talk about it.","Three-quarters of the world's population doesn't have enough to eat!","Depression, as far as I'm concerned, is just a waste of time.","A lot of women are turned off by the physical appearance of some of the first feminists.","I thought Erica Jong's Fear of Flying was one of the biggest pieces of crap that I've ever read in my life.","I don't think any one person is the cause of all of someone else's problems.","In the '50s, a lot of girls never saw beyond the wedding day.","Women today have more of an overview of their lives and how marriage is or is not a part of it.","I believe wholeheartedly in marriage. I don't exclusively mean a marriage with a legal contract, but any relationship that constitutes a marriage because of the quality of their relationship.","There is no magic person out there, no perfect human being out there waiting for you.","You're not going to find a man whose socks don't get dirty or who doesn't snore.","I think that two people who decide to live together in a marriage situation, they have an obligation to make the marriage work for them.","Yoga is wonderful. It clears up most health problems. It also gives you an overview.","Stop living a day at a time and stop worrying about age.","If you had told me when I was 18 that I wouldn't have made it until I was 29, I would have said, Forget it.","I am woman, hear me roar, in numbers too big to ignore, and I know too much to go back and pretend."],"Helen Rowland":["A man never knows how to say goodbye; a woman never knows when to say it.","You will never win if you never begin.","Home is any four walls that enclose the right person.","A wise woman puts a grain of sugar into everything she says to a man, and takes a grain of salt with everything he says to her.","Love, like a chicken salad or restaurant hash, must be taken with blind faith or it loses its flavor.","A man is like a cat; chase him and he will run - sit still and ignore him and he'll come purring at your feet.","A bachelor never quite gets over the idea that he is a thing of beauty and a boy forever.","Telling lies is a fault in a boy, an art in a lover, an accomplishment in a bachelor, and second-nature in a married man.","A woman's flattery may inflate a man's head a little; but her criticism goes straight to his heart, and contracts it so that it can never again hold quite as much love for her.","When two people decide to get a divorce, it isn't a sign that they 'don't understand' one another, but a sign that they have, at last, begun to.","A bride at her second marriage does not wear a veil. She wants to see what she is getting.","When a man spends his time giving his wife criticism and advice instead of compliments, he forgets that it was not his good judgment, but his charming manners, that won her heart.","A Bachelor of Arts is one who makes love to a lot of women, and yet has the art to remain a bachelor.","Flirting is the gentle art of making a man feel pleased with himself.","Some women can be fooled all of the time, and all women can be fooled some of the time, but the same woman can't be fooled by the same man in the same way more than half of the time.","Wedding: the point at which a man stops toasting a woman and begins roasting her.","Between lovers a little confession is a dangerous thing.","Marriage is like twirling a baton, turning hand springs or eating with chopsticks. It looks easy until you try it.","Life begins at 40 - but so do fallen arches, rheumatism, faulty eyesight, and the tendency to tell a story to the same person, three or four times.","A man snatches the first kiss, pleads for the second, demands the third, takes the fourth, accepts the fifth - and endures all the rest.","Nowadays love is a matter of chance, matrimony a matter of money and divorce a matter of course.","A man can become so accustomed to the thought of his own faults that he will begin to cherish them as charming little 'personal characteristics.'","It takes a woman twenty years to make a man of her son, and another woman twenty minutes to make a fool of him.","Jealousy is the tie that binds, and binds, and binds.","To be happy with a man you must understand him a lot and love him a little. To be happy with a woman you must love her a lot and not try to understand her at all.","Before marriage, a man declares that he would lay down his life to serve you; after marriage, he won't even lay down his newspaper to talk to you.","In olden times sacrifices were made at the altar - a practice which is still continued.","When a man makes a woman his wife, it's the highest compliment he can pay her, and it's usually the last.","France may claim the happiest marriages in the world, but the happiest divorces in the world are 'made in America.'","There are only two kinds of men; the dead and the deadly.","Falling in love consists merely in uncorking the imagination and bottling the common sense.","When a girl marries, she exchanges the attentions of many men for the inattention of one.","Every man wants a woman to appeal to his better side, his nobler instincts, and his higher nature - and another woman to help him forget them.","The follies which a man regrets the most in his life are those which he didn't commit when he had the opportunity.","Woman: the peg on which the wit hangs his jest, the preacher his text, the cynic his grouch and the sinner his justification.","Variety is the spice of love.","It isn't tying himself to one woman that a man dreads when he thinks of marrying; it's separating himself from all the others.","A husband is what is left of a lover, after the nerve has been extracted.","The hardest task in a girl's life is to prove to a man that his intentions are serious.","A man's heart may have a secret sanctuary where only one woman may enter, but it is full of little anterooms which are seldom vacant.","After a few years of marriage a man can look right at a woman without seeing her and a woman can see right through a man without looking at him.","There are people whose watch stops at a certain hour and who remain permanently at that age.","Failing to be there when a man wants her is the greatest sin a woman can commit - except being there when he doesn't want her.","And verily, a woman need know but one man well, in order to understand all men; whereas a man may know all women and understand not one of them.","Why does a man take it for granted that a girl who flirts with him wants him to kiss her - when, nine times out of ten, she only wants him to want to kiss her?","Love, the quest; marriage, the conquest; divorce, the inquest.","Somehow a bachelor never quite gets over the idea that he is a thing of beauty and a boy forever.","The tenderest spot in a man's make-up is sometimes the bald spot on top of his head.","What a man calls his 'conscience' is merely the mental action that follows a sentimental reaction after too much wine or love.","Don't waste time trying to break a man's heart; be satisfied if you can just manage to chip it in a brand new place.","A man's desire for a son is usually nothing but the wish to duplicate himself in order that such a remarkable pattern may not be lost to the world.","Marriage is the miracle that transforms a kiss from a pleasure into a duty.","There's so much saint in the worst of them, and so much devil in the best of them, that a woman who's married to one of them, has nothing to learn of the rest of them.","It takes one woman twenty years to make a man of her son - and another woman twenty minutes to make a fool of him.","A fool and her money are soon courted.","No man can understand why a woman shouldn't prefer a good reputation to a good time.","Never trust a husband too far, nor a bachelor too near.","One man's folly is another man's wife.","When you see what some women marry, you realize how they must hate to work for a living.","It is easier to keep half a dozen lovers guessing than to keep one lover after he has stopped guessing.","In love, somehow, a man's heart is always either exceeding the speed limit, or getting parked in the wrong place.","After marriage, a woman's sight becomes so keen that she can see right through her husband without looking at him, and a man's so dull that he can look right through his wife without seeing her.","The woman who appeals to a man's vanity may stimulate him, the woman who appeals to his heart may attract him, but it is the woman who appeals to his imagination who gets him.","Ever since Eve started it all by offering Adam the apple, woman's punishment has been to supply a man with food then suffer the consequences when it disagrees with him."],"Helen Sharman":["Because we were orbiting the earth faster than earth spins on its axis, we went around the earth 16 times a day, an earth day, which meant 16 periods of lightness and 16 periods of darkness in 24 hours. Every so often you'd look towards the earth, and often you could see lightness and darkness together, and dawn and sunset were spectacular.","You don't go into space just for the science. Economically, it is not worth it. I think the reason we should be in space is for the exploration; it's the human endeavour.","I still dream about being on the space station with the feeling of being weightless. The weightlessness is the most amazing, relaxing and natural feeling.","From space, the earth appears predominantly blue; the clouds are brilliant white. Surprisingly, you don't see much green, although Ireland looks green, and so do Scandinavia and New Zealand. The deserts are brick red and really stand out.","I operated a periscopic TV camera so the commander, Anatoly Artsebarsky, could establish where we were heading. It is real teamwork on Soyuz.","The view from space is really very special. From the window, you can look back at the Earth and see the stars around you. I just hope that more people from Britain get the chance to experience it.","People are fascinated by space flight. It makes them interested in science, gets them asking questions and motivates them.","I had been lucky that my physiology is well suited to space training.","I'm not going into infinity. I'm going into low earth orbit.","Politicians and the government have become too interested in short-term gains. Of course, if you look at the direct financial returns in the short term, human space flight is expensive. But they need to look longer term.","I would much rather fly on Soyuz than the shuttle.","On Mir, the lights kept going out because it had developed so many electrical problems.","I get standing ovations at meetings when I say Britain should be involved in human spaceflight. Unfortunately, that goal has been blocked by a handful of people in high office.","Just because I'm a woman does not mean I have to deal with everything to do with food.","The advice I was given was just to make sure you look out of the window occasionally. It's something no astronaut ever gets tired of doing.","I don't classify myself as the first space tourist because I wasn't as though I paid and had a holiday out of it - although I had a fab time.","There is good science you can do in space. There is stuff there you cannot do on Earth and we can gain understanding from it.","We should be pushing our boundaries. After all, we Britons are explorers and adventurers.","I lived at Star City for more than a year ahead of my trip to Mir on May 18, 1991 in Soyuz TM-12. My life at Star City was so remote that learning Russian became my greatest priority.","When the history books are written in a thousand years, when space travel would have become routine, the moment that humans first left Earth will be of huge importance. Star City is a central part of this story and it deserves more recognition.","I hope there will be continued U.K. investment in human spaceflight to enable Britain to benefit from space travel in the longer term and that many more Britons - women and men - will travel into space.","The government will see that human spaceflight is useful - for science and the economy - and inspirational.","Britain should definitely be part of a Mars mission.","You can do more science on the ground than you can in space for the same amount of money. But there is some science you can not do on the ground.","It's very exciting that people could actually live on another planet.","Is a one-way trip to Mars ever really seriously going to happen? Surely that's morally reprehensible. However old people are, however much they say they want to go on a one-way mission, people should be thinking about the possibility of returning.","I'd love to go back to space, I don't know any astronaut who doesn't want to.","While we've taken seeds into space, and astronauts on the International Space Station have eaten lettuce they've grown, we haven't produced fruit in space, so we can't pollinate something.","During launch, the outside of the rocket is covered in a protective fairing, so we couldn't see outside, but as soon as that was jettisoned, my first view of the earth was over the Pacific Ocean, which was this wonderful deep blue, with clouds just over the top, and sunlight streaming in through the window.","As the craft re-entered earth's atmosphere, it was coming in so fast, it heated up the surrounding atoms and molecules, and they became positively and negatively charged, and highly reactive, and began luminescing all around us."],"Helen Slater":["It may not be the most popular but there is a place for it. I think about the kind of music I love, acoustic, melodic, and I guess it kind of took a bit of courage on my part to think I could be one of those songwriters.","With acting I am being led by the script, other actors, the director, etc. But with songwriting I feel it is much more self reliant and allows me to be in the creative experience without being as dependent on others.","I am less selfish. But I am more insistent on being part of the creative experience. I find I am a better mother, lover and wife when I am writing. When my daughter was small I wasn't writing as much and I didn't miss it.","I was terribly gawky, too goofy to become a high-kicking cheerleader, with stringy brown hair and bad posture. Definitely nobody noticeable!","I can't speak for all women, but I do think that... I mean, me and my girlfriends, we definitely... we're in crisis on a continuous basis...or at least monthly, for sure, I don't know.","I don't know about this thing - being famous. I haven't figured it out yet. It still mystifies me.","The way I spend my time is very isolated and cut off.","I'm very passionate about philosophy and religion.","I take things too seriously.","Do you think I'm going to be one of those flash-in-the-pan actresses?","I met a bunch of comic-book writers at the Metropolis convention and there was such an interesting discussion about the story of 'Supergirl' and trying to get it right. It can be a challenge, because you don't want it to be the same as the Superman story."],"Helen Suzman":["I stand for simple justice, equal opportunity and human rights. The indispensable elements in a democratic society - and well worth fighting for.","I am provocative, and I admit this. It isn't as if I'm only on the receiving end, a poor, frail little creature. I can be thoroughly nasty when I get going, and I don't pull my punches.","Debate is almost non-existent and no one is apparently accountable to anybody apart from their political party bosses. It is bad news for democracy in this country.","For all my criticisms of the current system, it doesn't mean that I would like to return to the old one.","I am hopeful about any future for whites in this country, but not entirely optimistic.","I don't think we will ever go the way of Zimbabwe, but people are concerned.","I used to be a fan of proportional representation, but I am not at all now I have seen it in action.","It is the answers, not the questions, that are embarrassing.","That's my life in there. It would never be possible today to ask as many questions as I did.","This country is armed to the teeth, and none of these African states could begin to attack South Africa.","I represent all the enlightened people in this country, and that's a fine thing to be able to do. It infuriates my opponents when I say this, but it is true.","My own electorate, which I represented for 36 years as an anti-apartheid politician, had a considerable number of Jewish voters supporting me throughout my career.","The employment laws are completely unrealistic. You cannot overcome that in only 10 years. It will take at least another generation before young people are properly qualified.","Tool of Communist agitators... it's really a joke, isn't it? Because, quite clearly, we are a party of real moderates. It just shows how little they understand.","All these stories are grist to the mill of the government because they build up a very useful war psychosis.","I can say unequivocally that the boycott does not work. It's never complete enough to have impact unless it's backed by force, and I don't think anybody in America seriously proposes that."],"Helen Thomas":["Everyone with a cell phone thinks they're a photographer. Everyone with a laptop thinks they're a journalist. But they have no training, and they have no idea of what we keep to in terms of standards, as in what's far out and what's reality. And they have no dedication to truth.","We don't go into journalism to be popular. It is our job to seek the truth and put constant pressure on our leaders until we get answers.","When you're in the news business, you always expect the unexpected.","We in the press have a special role since there is no other institution in our society that can hold the President accountable. I do believe that our democracy can endure and prevail only if the American people are informed.","Presidential power was overruled by the high bench in July 1974, when President Nixon was ordered to turn over some audio tapes of his White House conversations, including the 'smoking gun' tape of June 23, 1972, that revealing the Watergate cover up.","I think I'll work all my life. When you're having fun, why stop having fun?","I covered two presidents, LBJ and Nixon, who could no longer convince, persuade, or govern, once people had decided they had no credibility, but we seem to be more tolerant now of what I think we should not tolerate.","In Plains, I saw Jimmy Carter as he really is - a nice, decent man... in terms of compassionate contribution to society, he certainly has proven to be our best past president.","If we care about the children, the grandchildren, the future generations, we need to make sure that they do not become the cannon fodder of the future.","There are better ways we can transform this virulent hatred - by living our ideals, the Peace Corps, exchange students, teachers, exporting our music, poetry, blue jeans.","It's like I say to young people who ask me about going into journalism: If you want to be loved, don't go into this business.","I don't think a tough question is disrespectful.","Congress, the White House, and Hollywood, Wall Street, are owned by the Zionists.","I'm not anti-Jewish; I'm anti-Zionist.","War makes strange bedfellows.","We are the only institution in our society that can question a president on a regular basis and make him accountable. Otherwise, he could be king.","It's time for women to make their voices heard. Their silence on the subject of war and peace is deafening.","I love my work, and I think that I was so lucky to pick a profession where it's a joy to go to work every day.","Truman fired the popular Gen. Douglas MacArthur because he disobeyed orders in the Korean War. Johnson knew that he had reached the endgame in Vietnam when Gen. William Westmoreland, the top commander in Vietnam, requested 240,000 more troops in 1968 for the prolonged war that also could not be won.","I can remember the morning after President Nixon won re-election in 1972. His chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, called a Cabinet meeting and told the members: 'You are all a bunch of burned-out volcanoes;' and asked for their resignations.","When you speak of the press, of course, you have to speak of different segments of the press. Reporters, straight reporters, wire services, you stick to the facts; you don't create the story, per se. You cover what is happening.","This is the worst President ever. He George W. Bush is the worst President in all of American history.","I'm covering the worst president in American history.","Every President hates the Press.","You don't spread democracy through the barrel of a gun.","We won't really know what will happen until it happens.","But when will our leaders learn - war is not the answer.","All presidents rail against the press. It goes with the turf.","We got the vote, which we should've been born with, in 1920. Everything we've had to struggle for - it's ridiculous.","The White House used to belong to the American people. At least that's what I learned from history books and from covering every president starting with John F. Kennedy.","Every president thinks that all information that comes to the White House is their private preserve after they all promise an open administration on the campaign trail, but some are more secretive than others. Some want to lock down everything.","I don't think there are any rude questions.","I've never covered the president in any way other than that he is ultimately responsible.","I censored myself for 50 years when I was a reporter. Now I wake up and ask myself, 'Who do I hate today?'","I wrote that President Bush is passing on to President-elect Obama two wars and an economic debacle. I call it a depression. And he is arming Israel against the Palestinians in every way in Gaza.","I have a background and an understanding of what's happened in the Middle East that a lot of people don't have, because there's been no interest.","I'm of Arab background.","People will never know how hard it is to get information, especially if it's locked up behind official doors where, if politicians had their way, they'd stamp 'top secret' on the color of the walls.","I respect the office of the presidency, but I never worship at the shrines of our public servants... The Washington press corps has the privilege of asking the president of the United States what he is doing and why.","The presidency awed me, but presidents do not. Perhaps I have always expected too much of them, but I believe that when they reach the highest office in the land, they should live up to the greatest honor that can come to a person in American political life. Some have stood the test better than others.","We began to see the renovation of our offices as a subtle part of the Nixon war against the press.","I covered Kennedy when she was three years old and the darling daughter of President Kennedy who doted on her and whose mother did everything to protect her from the prying press.","Many voters think about the makeup of the Supreme Court when they are choosing a president. The justices deal not only with constitutional issues but also with social issues that were unknown to the founding fathers who wrote the Constitution more than 200 years ago.","Presidents hate the press. They hate me most of the time.","I think Obama is handling his image very well, but I think he lacks boldness.","I had a lot of fun bantering back and forth with Kennedy. But for ease and comfort, it would be Gerald Ford. He was a down-home type. I came from the Midwest and he came from the Midwest. He was nonaggressive and kindly.","I'm decrepit but I don't want to give up, and I love my work.","I think that presidents deserve to be questioned. Maybe irreverently, most of the time. Bring 'em down a size. You see a president, ask a question. You have one chance in the barrel. Don't blow it.","As a reporter having covered him for eight years in the White House, I am sure the press could have done a better job if we had known the real Ronald Reagan.","Vice President Dick Cheney reportedly has been disturbed over what he sees as the erosion of presidential powers since the Watergate scandal and has urged Bush to take a stronger stand against what Cheney sees as congressional intrusions into the executive branch.","Clinton is the first female to be taken seriously for the highest office in the land. She has the credentials, the stamina and she is a good campaigner. Her detractors in both parties like to say she can't win, but they may be proven wrong.","President Bush has asserted the right to wiretap and eavesdrop on any American without a warrant in the name of fighting terrorism. He has asserted presidential power beyond stated constitutional rights, and there is no Republican gutsy enough to call his hand.","Maybe the Jefferson case will give members of Congress second thoughts the next time they get ready to legislate away the rights of ordinary Americans.","The sudden ending of a White House career all seems so unceremonious for aides who have personally sacrificed a lot - and sometimes even bent their conscience - to do the president's bidding.","The United States has tried for years to live down President Franklin D. Roosevelt's order during World War II to move Japanese-Americans on the West Coast to inland detention camps on grounds that they might be disloyal.","I hit the third rail. You cannot criticize Israel in this country and survive.","The day Dick Cheney is going to run for president, I'll kill myself. All we need is one more liar.","We have organized lobbyists in favor of Israel. You can't open your mouth. I can call the president of the United States anything in the book, but if you say one thing about Israel, and you're off limits.","Great presidents take stands, and they fight off these people who really are so far to the right. I don't want to call them names, even though they would call me names.","I was in Independence, Missouri when Johnson signed the Medicare bill, with Truman standing there. Truman had first proposed Medicare, but couldn't get it through.","I got into the Kennedy White House because at the time I was president of the Women's National Press Club, and they assigned me to cover the early days of the Kennedy campaign. Jackie especially. Everyone was interested in the family.","All of us who covered the Reagans agreed that President Reagan was personable and charming, but I'm not so certain he was nice. It's hard for me to think of anyone as 'nice' when I hear him say 'The homeless are homeless because they want to be homeless.'","To my mind, a president should care about all people, and he didn't, which is why I will always feel Reagan lacked soul.","I'm a liberal, I was born a liberal, and I will be a liberal 'til the day I die.","You don't spread democracy with a barrel of a gun."],"Helen Vendler":["The art of utterance persuades initially by its music and its rhythm, before semiotic or personal characteristics come into play.","I always write after I think for quite a long time, so the actual writing time is rather short. I think a lot of the work gets done when you have something on your mind while you're doing many other things.","I wouldn't be very happy if a poet read what I had written and said, 'What a peculiar thing to say about this work of mine.'","I think that a lot of things are hard to read if you're not in the vocabulary flow of that particular discourse. I sometimes forget that even though the words I'm using are fairly ordinary words, the concepts around which they cluster, which are the long concepts of literary tradition, may not be familiar to an audience.","I believe that poems are a score for performance by the reader, and that you become the speaking voice. You don't read or overhear the voice in the poem - you are the voice in the poem.","Twentieth-century American poetry has been one of the glories of modern literature.","I was unnerved to learn in my twenties that the poems of Emily Dickinson that I had memorized as a girl were not the poems as she had written them.","When I first heard Wallace Stevens' voice, it was by chance: a friend wanted to listen to the recording he had made for the Harvard Vocarium Series.","There are not many poets whose fame rests on a single work.","I like art history and art criticism. Leo Steinberg has always been my favorite. He's very original, very accurate and acute.","I would like to spend more time with Spanish poetry. I know French better than Spanish, but Spanish was my first language, and my father spoke it to us.","If you like the precision and concision of poetry, a page of prose is unsatisfying in a certain way. And poetry is so direct.","I liked teaching Henry James. When you look down at a Henry James novel from a helicopter height, you find an intricate spider web that all clings together."],"Helen Wills Moody":["The angle from which the line and ball are seen makes a tremendous difference in the call, and the player who is inclined to fret inwardly about decisions should realize this.","I love the feel of hitting the ball hard, the pleasure of a rally. It is these things that make tennis the delightful game that it is.","When I play, I become entirely absorbed in the game. It may be a form of concentration.","No player can become accustomed to New York's climate in August in a few days. The playing conditions, the courts in New York and France are very different.","I can remember when, as a beginner, I was delighted with any ball as long as it would bounce.","My feelings, as the last ball travelled over the net, and as I realized that the final match was mine, I cannot describe. I felt that here was a prize for all the games I had ever played.","The seeded draw came into being. This means that the two best players of the tournament are placed in opposite halves in the draw, and cannot possibly meet until the finals, if they come through successfully against all the rest of the participants.","Balls should be good for at least six sets, and for more for the average player. But if the rallies are long, they do not last as long as this. There is a fuzz on the surface that wears off on the hard court.","The 1927 Wimbledon finals were almost put off because of the rain, which threatened every moment.","Unless a player goes in for intensive play and tournament competition, two racquets are sufficient.","Four times out of five the linesman gets a better view of the ball near him than the player himself.","Spectators often express disfavor of fair decisions."],"Helena Blavatsky":["Everything that is, was, and will be, eternally IS, even the countless forms, which are finite and perishable only in their objective, not in their ideal Form.","Yet, the Universe is real enough to the conscious beings in it, which are as unreal as it is itself.","Becoming is the mode of activity of the uncreate deity.","We see that every external motion, act, gesture, whether voluntary or mechanical, organic or mental, is produced and preceded by internal feeling or emotion, will or volition, and thought or mind.","The Path that leadeth on is lighted by one fire - the light of daring burning in the heart. The more one dares, the more he shall obtain.","To act wisely when the time for action comes, to wait patiently when it is time for repose, put man in accord with the tides. Ignorance of this law results in periods of unreasoning enthusiasm on the one hand, and depression on the other.","The whole order of nature evinces a progressive march towards a higher life.","It is, then, by those shadows of the hoary Past and their fantastic silhouettes on the external screen of every religion and philosophy, that we can, by checking them as we go along, and comparing them, trace out finally the body that produced them.","But the first differentiation of its reflection in the manifested World is purely Spiritual, and the Beings generated in it are not endowed with a consciousness that has any relation to the one we conceive of.","The Universe is the periodical manifestation of this unknown Absolute Essence.","Everything in the Universe, throughout all its kingdoms, is conscious: i.e., endowed with a consciousness of its own kind and on its own plane of perception.","The Secret Doctrine is the common property of the countless millions of men born under various climates, in times with which History refuses to deal, and to which esoteric teachings assign dates incompatible with the theories of Geology and Anthropology.","The Universe is worked and guided from within outwards.","The chief difficulty which prevents men of science from believing in divine as well as in nature Spirits is their materialism.","If coming events are said to cast their shadows before, past events cannot fall to leave their impress behind them.","The Occultists, however, know that the traditions of Esoteric Philosophy must be the right ones, simply because they are the most logical, and reconcile every difficulty.","Even in our day, science suspects beyond the Polar seas, at the very circle of the Arctic Pole, the existence of a sea which never freezes and a continent which is ever green.","As no outward motion or change, when normal, in man's external body can take place unless provoked by an inward impulse, given through one of the three functions named, so with the external or manifested Universe.","It is on the acceptance or rejection of the theory of the Unity of all in Nature, in its ultimate Essence, that mainly rests the belief or unbelief in the existence around us of other conscious beings besides the Spirits of the Dead."],"Helena Bonham Carter":["If you're a queen, you're powerless, so I'd probably demote myself and go shopping.","You become very angry and depressed that you keep getting offered only these exceedingly demure and repressed roles. They're so not me. That's why films like Fight Club were so important to me because I think I confounded certain stereotypes and limited perceptions of what I could do as an actress.","I'm drawn to emotionally damaged characters because there is more to unlock.","I liked pretending to be other people: I could reinvent myself, reinvent my own reality.","I drink booze, I smoke, and I'm hooked on caffeine. I actually have been known to swear at times and belch and even raise my voice when provoked. And I'm not physically repressed!","When I was young I had so many inferiority complexes. I had an inferiority complex because I didn't go to university. I had an inferiority complex because I didn't train. Then it gets tiring. And you do get bored of it.","Mothers are the heart of any household. I try to spend as much time with my children as I possibly can while also fulfilling my professional duties. It is tricky, but I think I manage it.","It was weird because I was pregnant, throughout that so it was weird being a pregnant witch. I was in a really bad mood but luckily, because I sleep with the director, he just sort of scheduled me so I only had to do it two nights.","I should get a few ribs taken out, because I'll be in a corset for the rest of my life.","You can't ever put your self-definition in the hands of somebody who meets you for 15 minutes.","I was a mixture of being incredibly old for my age and incredibly backwards. I was born quite old, but then I stopped growing. I lived with my mum and dad till I was 30.","Not only was it nearly impossible to hear because of these huge rubber ears we had to wear, but we also had these huge furry hands which were absolutely useless, especially if you had to scratch yourself.","I love changing what I look like because I always feel super strange whenever I do watch something that I'm in.","I think smells, like sounds, can be so much immediately affecting.","A film actor is just a victim of directors and editors.","I love witches and magic and dress-up and make-believe.","It took me ages to grow into being a woman, into being happy with it.","Famous people come up to me, but I don't know who they are because my sight is so bad. It's always at the pool of the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills when I don't have my lenses in and my glasses are in my room.","I enjoy those small chats you have when people come up and talk to you about your work. It only involves a few seconds of effort to be nice to those people, and I am very grateful for the kind words that people have taken the trouble to express to me in person.","All the ancient classic fairy tales have always been scary and dark.","The problems come when your personal life and relationships come under scrutiny in the press and often very uncomplimentary things are printed about you.","There is no normality in life.","That's the thing with animated films - I often feel that puppets get the better parts compared to us normal actresses.","You can actually have a pitch button, you know, to get people on pitch.","Because I sleep with him he asked me to audition, you know?","It didn't matter what you look like. You don't have to get up at 5:30 in the morning and there's a lot to be said for that. Corpse Bride can just play all my parts from now on and I'll just do the voice.","Most of my relationships were people in the business. Having said that, me and Tim don't really talk that much about work. He comes into my bit of the house every so often to vent but we don't really have very high, cultured conversations.","Well, at least I'm not too thin. I eat.","When you're up for an Oscar, you just get offered everything. It's fantastic, but a lot of it you're completely inappropriate for.","Wearing corsets all the time was completely incapacitating, as far as digestion goes.","In any relationship, after the first year is over, you can't help but want your own space.","J.K. Rowling said Bellatrix's role was going to be significant in the last one, when I showed some reluctance in playing a tiny bit part. Up front, they said, 'You're very significant in the last one.' But significant could mean a lot of things. That could just mean a significant plot point. Doesn't necessarily equal big part.","What I loved about playing the corpse is that obviously somebody else got to do the physical part. It appeals to the part of me that likes playing character parts and getting the chance to get away from my own physicality.","Multitasking? I can't even do two things at once. I can't even do one thing at once.","I'm not dead and I don't have blue hair but some people say there are similarities. It is usually intolerable to watch myself onscreen but this time it's fine. I think it's beautiful and a real work of art.","I don't think kids have a problem with death. It's us older ones who are nearer to it, that start being frightened.","I was sad that Corpse Bride was so short. I would've liked to have had her around for way longer. She doesn't actually have that many scenes.","Tim also has enough confidence so that it always looks like a Tim Burton film, but it really is collaborative. You're allowed to do it your way but of course he's always going to choose his way.","I was like one of those nauseatingly nice children. I was very, very well behaved and boring.","It was a challenge to be able to create a character without being able to use one's normal set of expressions. All the rubber and makeup attached to your face left you with only a modest range of facial movements.","You learn to rely on a few basic movements and use your voice to the greatest extent possible to convey your emotions. So there was a technical challenge there and a responsibility to create a character from behind the mask.","Usually I'm frustrated when I look at my films and I don't believe that I've made a real transformation beyond my usual sets of gestures and expressions. I still have this nagging feeling that it's me, that I didn't create a unique character.","No matter how many modern parts I do, people still refer to me as Mrs. Costume Drama. Fight Club is a studio pic, and I've done very few of those. I've got a feeling it's going to change things for me.","It took me so many years to move out. I'm definitely a bit of a Peter Pan, reluctant to grow up. It all seemed really nice at home-why change it? Part of me would prefer not to have any responsibility whatsoever.","With the number of people I ignore, I'm lucky I work at all in this town.","It would be nice to really shed the corsets.","I'm the kind of actor who has ventured into escaping from me.","I also get fed up with the fact that casting agents and directors have this impression of me as being frail and petite. I find it very patronizing. I'm quite beefy and strong. I was a gymnast in school and I have lots of muscles.","I have to struggle to change people's perceptions of me. I grew very frustrated with the perception that I'm this shy, retiring, inhibited aristocratic creature when I'm absolutely not like that at all. I think I'm much more outgoing and exuberant than my image.","I think I've still got a bit of a sado-masochistic streak in me, because if I'm not going to be restricted by corsets and covered in lace, then I still wind up wearing an ape-mask over my face. I do wonder how I get myself in these situations!","It's different when you're an actor and playing a part, but when it's just you, you feel immensely vulnerable have strangers prodding and prying.","Journalists are always calling my features Edwardian or Victorian, whatever that means. I am small, and people were smaller in those times. I'm pale and sickly-looking. I look fragile-like a doll. But sometimes I just wish I had less of a particular look, one that was more versatile.","People have lots of misconceptions about me. My mum, who is half French and half Spanish, gets outraged when I'm called quintessentially English. I owe my looks to my mum-which was 90 percent of getting my first job. And, some people would argue, 90 percent of my entire career.","I hate this image of me as a prim Edwardian. I want to shock everyone.","People say, 'You're still breast-feeding, that's so generous.' Generous, no! It gives me boobs and it takes my thighs away! It's sort of like natural liposuction. I'd carry on breast-feeding for the rest of my life if I could.","The animators are absolutely extraordinary. It's mind-boggling.","No, I can never rely on Tim to make me pretty.","I just went and got an agent because I thought I can create my own world - you can't right your own life, but you can escape to a world where you can have control.","I remember I did think, 'Wouldn't it be nice if Mr. Right moved in next door?'","I'm often criticised for what I wear. That's my main label in the press now: disastrous dresser!","I've never had white teeth. To be honest, I've never been told to do any of those horrible things - get your teeth whitened or your nose straightened.","I loved doing all those costume dramas. I didn't think, 'Ooh I've got to avoid being typecast' - you can't ever be dictated to by what other people think. I just do things because I fancy the parts and the directors.","It's easy for me to go back to being a kid. You know how kids can be like savages before they get civilized? There's that sadist quality. Y'know, like boys who like to pick apart an insect for the sake of it.","She looks like a warrior. I mean, Bellatrix does mean warrior. And she's also a bit of a fatale. She's the right hand of Voldemort, and the only woman death eater.","I was weird right from the start. It's just that you can't ever expect people to get you. And I do think that really did mess with my head, being well-known young, when you really don't know who you are.","I'm a very good sleeper.","I just do things because I fancy the parts and the directors.","I think my mouth just opens and I spontaneously say things that occur to me.","I'm always attracted to lower budget, not because it's lower budget, but because they tend to be better scripts.","But it's often been the case, I've done so many countless small, independent films that really 3.2 people have seen, so you never know. You do it for the joy of the part and not necessarily expect anyone to see the final product.","My mom being a psychotherapist, I've been brought up with that whole psychoanalytical terrain.","My father fell really chronically ill when I was 13 and that's when I phoned up an agent and started to act.","When you write for very young children what they want is something familiar and safe and stereotyped.","I was reading William Shawcross's biography of the Queen Mother, dressed in my witch outfit! And you know what? It was a really good mix; it was a therapeutic mix.","Fairytales have always got to have that scary quality, as long as you make them laugh.","Very early on, you figure out that you put your self-esteem in the hands of strangers. There's a different commodity. There's the Helena Bonham Carter that everyone thinks they know, who really has nothing to do with me. But you just have to let that go.","Everybody has an inferiority complex when they step into a room. But then when you have children and you get older, it doesn't really matter. When I was young I had so many inferiority complexes. I had an inferiority complex because I didn't go to university. I had an inferiority complex because I didn't train.","I never really wanted to grow up. I grew up really young. I moved out when I was 13 - that's when I started acting.","I've got Tourette's, practically. I'll tell anyone anything.","I'm a late developer. I only moved out of home when I was 30.","As everyone, you do end up becoming your mother, but also as you're acting, I find out you become every member of your family, bits come out without you really wanting them to come out.","A lot of times in this business, it's so transitory - it's just 10 weeks here or there on a movie and then it's over - but to see the same people over all that time, a decade, makes you feel really safe and secure.","The parenting bit is much harder than the acting bit. You just never know what to do.","I personally never got the gist of Facebook and Twitter.","My life had been very work-orientated, and all in close-up. Once I had the family, it went into sudden widescreen.","I look completely like my mum. She's very foreign, very Jewish.","I don't think I dress eccentrically. I'm just not conservative, I guess - I dress according to what like. And I'm not a mannequin, as you can tell.","I would pretend to be the French lieutenant's woman. I was always a romantic. I still am, actually.","For me, acting is about getting away from myself. So to look at myself is the last thing I want.","I don't think any actor wants their children to follow them into the profession.","I'm always attracted to lower budget, not because it's lower budget, but because they tend to be better scripts. It's the scripts that tend to be the small arthouse film that tend to be more actor-led and character driven."],"Helena Christensen":["A beautiful person is someone who stays true to themselves and their spirit; someone who is self-confident and can make you smile.","There will always be a desire for something new, fresh and innovative, as well as a yearning and respect for timeless elegance and beauty.","I still love taking pictures with Polaroid film. For me, it offers the most beautiful way of capturing reality and transferring it onto a flat piece of paper.","When you are modelling, you are creating a picture, a still life, perhaps something like a silent film. You convey emotion but you are only using your body.","The more people explore the world, the more they realize in every country there's a different aesthetic. Beauty really is in the eye of the beholder.","I like people who dress quirkly and differently. Like in womenswear, thank god for Helena Bonham Carter!","It's really intimidating to go on the beach in a bikini.","I was born in high heels and I've worn them ever since.","In modelling, there is no point in trying to prove you have a brain, so why even bother? I'd sooner save the energy for something more meaningful.","There are particular images that I like. Allegro is composed of a series of still life photographs that has been put to speed. There is so much care that has gone into the composition of the cinematography.","I've taken my knickers off. My friends told me my panty line was visible, so I went without.","I am very much aware of the visual side of things. I do a lot of photography. I often take Polaroids of things that strike me as visually interesting, just to remember them and perhaps use later.","I had never done any serious acting before, but I decided that it was a chance that I should take.","Kate is going to come back, she is going to be super-strong again. Everybody is going to want her again because she is that kind of person. She is very professional and beautiful and she is going to be around forever.","This was all very new to me and I did not want to ruin his film! So we worked hard on that basis of confidence that is needed to collaborate comfortably.","When on the set of a film, you have to play natural for entire scenes in a very unnatural environment. You have to express emotions and interact with other actors and also use your voice.","Modelling is a silly, crazy business.","I love playing around with vintage fabrics and lace.","There've been times when I've bought a whole pound of cheese and walked down the street and eaten it in one go.","I'm a fun person. I like cracking jokes and being completely nerdy.","Some designers retain a sense of humour about what they do, but others are deathly serious and have no life outside of it; they're lying awake night after night constructing dresses in their heads.","So many times I've wanted to crack up, standing there stiff while seven women are crawling round my toes fixing hems and the designer's having a freak-out because the denim cuffs are crooked. I'm on the verge of hysteria.","I was once stranded on a broken-down boat in shark-infested waters in the middle of the Indian Ocean for five days before we were rescued while doing a 'Vogue' shoot.","I always loved the style of Jean Seberg, Jane Birkin and Marilyn Monroe.","I would love to photograph Stephen Hawking. I am just fascinated by science, I really am.","I don't look at fashion the way other people do.","Women can explore so much in dressing. But if I was a guy I would wear vintage suits constantly. With crazy ties!","It's incredible to have been part of fashion history - my whole career has been one big highlight.","I felt like I was in the best photography school in the world - I had Herb Ritts, Bruce Weber, Richard Avedon and Irving Penn teach me.","If I have an hour in a city, I go to vintage stores first because it's so much cooler to find a piece that is unique. I love the thought of some girl having worn it before and living her life in it.","Denmark is like a secret little place with its own special language.","Harbour Island in the Bahamas is a wonderful little island with beautiful beaches, a great restaurant culture and friendly, welcoming atmosphere.","I am a serious food lover and Peruvian cuisine is one of the best in the world.","Like any woman, I worry about my body.","I want to live to be 120. That's when I will start worrying about my age.","I wasn't worried about turning 40 at all.","From the minute I wake up until I go to bed I think about food.","I believe food is the most brilliant invention ever.","I find it utterly bizarre that total strangers write about your life in a completely fictional manner.","Cheese is one of my great weaknesses, I could eat the stuff by the pound."],"Helena Mattsson":["I try to go to the gym a few times a week, but I admit, I cheat sometimes, and sometimes I don't go as often. I usually do more cardio and little bit of weights.","I love jewelry, I love bracelets, necklaces, but most of all I'm casual.","It's an honor to have people follow you and watch you. I do get a lot of fan mail and I read everything. It's very flattering and sort of surreal. I'm very glad that people like what I do and they want to follow what's going on.","I'm sort of like a jeans and boots kind of girl. Casual comfortable. I like soft colors and solid colors.","Growing up in Sweden, I decided pretty early on that I wanted to go to acting school.","I just love to bake chocolate cakes and anything unhealthy. It makes me very popular."],"Helena Norberg-Hodge":["At a deep psychological level, convincing young people that they will get the respect, admiration, love that they are looking for through consumerism is a manipulation of a deep human instinct to want to belong.","Happiness, as a word, has become sort of equated with these smiling images on television, selling some nice cream or food product or something. It's seen a bit as being a stupid consumer.","What motivates me is the conviction that our problems are mainly a consequence of a lack of holistic understanding of the man-made system in which we are entwined.","Even in America, people have said again and again that they would be willing to sacrifice for a cleaner environment.","I think we should focus more, rather than less, on mobilising the middle classes. They often have a bit of time and money to contribute to change.","As signs of climate instability increase, radical and rapid action is becoming ever more urgent.","One of the best ways of reducing both CO2 emissions and poverty in the South would be to strengthen the existing, decentralised demographic pattern by keeping villages and small towns alive. This would allow communities to maintain social cohesion and a closer contact with the land.","There's often a discussion about, 'Well, how do we know what happiness is? Is it real?' I've always argued that all of us know that there's a huge difference between how we feel when we feel happy and when we don't feel happy."],"Helena Rubinstein":["Hard work keeps the wrinkles out of the mind and spirit.","Daylight reveals color; artificial light drains it.","Whether you are sixteen or over sixty, remember, understatement is the rule of a fine makeup artist.","There are no ugly women, only lazy ones.","All the American women had purple noses and gray lips and their faces were chalk white from terrible powder. I recognized that the United States could be my life's work.","Leave the table while you still feel you could eat a little more.","Men are just as vain as women, and sometimes even more so.","Adjust your makeup to the light in which your wear it."],"Helene D. Gayle":["Real, sustainable community change requires the initiative and engagement of community members.","The more you look into health and health inequalities, you realize that a lot of it is not due to a particular disease - it's really linked to underlying societal issues such as poverty, inequity, lack of access to safe drinking water and housing. And these are all the things we focus on at CARE.","The difference between rich and poor is becoming more extreme, and as income inequality widens the wealth gap in major nations, education, health and social mobility are all threatened.","Early marriage is most prevalent in communities suffering deep, chronic poverty.","My father had the main barber- and beauty-supply business in the African-American community in Buffalo.","I always knew that I wanted to do the most that I could for the most people.","In order to counteract income inequality, it's essential to tackle poverty in an integrated way that has long-term impact. We need to give people the capacity to be resilient, to take on challenges and to learn the skills they need to work toward more prosperous futures.","With political will and strategic initiatives, we can prevent more and more of our global neighbors from falling into the abyss of poverty and instead give future generations the opportunities they need to rise to their fullest potential.","As many as half of Ethiopia's girls become wives before becoming adults. But Ethiopia is also a place where lasting solutions to child marriage are starting to make a difference.","CARE and our partner organizations have found that one of the most effective ways of stopping child marriage is to tap into a parent's love for their child. When parents learn about the consequences of child marriage, they're far less likely to push their children into it.","Ethiopia's government is doing a commendable job of working closely with donors and humanitarian organizations to educate parents about child marriage, and to support organizations like the Hamlin Fistula Hospital.","I was the middle of five children, and we were five very opinionated siblings. That probably pushed me to learn to speak up for myself.","At the Centers for Disease Control, I rose up fairly quickly into management positions. The first team I led there included many people who had been my supervisors in previous roles or were more senior than I was. So it was kind of a daunting challenge.","A big part of leadership is just being comfortable with the fact that some decisions really are only yours.","At CARE, a leading humanitarian organization, we recognize people live their lives in a holistic manner. Issues such as health care, education and economic empowerment cannot be addressed in a vacuum. Thus, effective programs need to tackle the multiple root causes of poverty.","There is no doubt that a woman's economic empowerment is very much interconnected to her health and the well being of her children.","When I want to explain why empowering girls and women is critical to fighting poverty, I often tell a person's story. It's easier to relate to a personal story than to global data telling us that the majority of the billion people who live on less than $2 per day are women and girls. We are often told to never treat a person like a statistic.","In Nueva Esperanza, Honduras, community members pooled their resources and organized a local water committee that with CARE's technical guidance built a gravity-fed water system that now provides clean water directly to people's homes.","We always say at CARE that we would love to see if we can work ourselves out of business.","When I walk into a room that is all white and all male, I'm sitting on the outside of that club. That's sometimes an intimidating experience. But I think that everywhere that I've gotten is because I've worked hard. I have the experience, I have the credentials - I continue not to take any of that for granted.","We know that if you educate a girl, as the saying goes, you educate a nation. That girl will get married later, she will have fewer children, she's more likely to earn an income, and that income is more likely to be plowed back into the family so that the family benefits."],"Helene Deutsch":["After all, the ultimate goal of all research is not objectivity, but truth.","The embattled gates to equal rights indeed opened up for modern women, but I sometimes think to myself; that is not what I meant by freedom, it is only social progress."],"Helge Ingstad":["I came into the world at the right time.","It was very clear that this was a very, very old site. There were remains of sod walls. Fishermen assumed it was an old Indian site. Bu Indians didn't use that kind of buildings and houses."],"Helio Castroneves":["To be honest, Brazilian people are fun people, and the country is amazing. It's full of beautiful people. I love the beaches.","I have not changed much. I haven't gotten a big ego or anything.","If you don't finish half of the races, you are not going to have a very good season.","I don't think I would be a good actor! People enjoyed 'Dancing With the Stars' because I was myself, and every time they told me to say something, I would say my own words, so I don't think I could follow a script well!","I like people with a good sense of humor, like Jennifer Aniston. She is amazing and is a great actress.","Dancing is just like racing. You don't learn choreography. They just give you steps to do, and you do them over and over and over. It's very much like what I do in racing.","When I'm driving the race track, it's all about repetition."],"Helle Thorning-Schmidt":["For young girls, whom I meet a lot when I travel around the country, it will be a big thing. It will really show them that there's no post in Denmark that a girl can't aspire to.","But what sets Europe apart is we insist on a social model that consists of solidarity, equal opportunity and a certain amount of redistribution.","We can say farewell to 10 years of bourgeois rule... now we have the opportunity to change Denmark.","This is not an election where we hand out gifts. It is an election where we ask everyone to contribute more.","We have the opportunity to change Denmark - that opportunity must be seized.","Without growth we can't pay down our debt, and without growth there's no money for welfare.","We are not jumping on the austerity bandwagon. A healthy economy is by far the most important thing for Social Democrats.","Of course we have to address the deficit if we win.","I feel like giving myself a pat on the back. We can create history tonight. We can bid goodbye to 10 years of (Liberal-Conservative) government which has ground to a halt, and get a new government and a new majority in Denmark.","Denmark needs change, Denmark needs to move on and Denmark needs my leadership.","We did it. Make no mistake: We have written history. Today there's a change of guards in Denmark.","I'm taking care of the children, doing a bit of cooking and trying to do a bit of DIY around the house. But that's not going too well.","I know too much about British politics to comment on British politics.","I really appreciate the British part of my family.","People want to make sacrifices but they don't want to be sacrificed.","So yes, European decision making is not pretty. But it does work."],"Helmut Jahn":["Working is actually a pleasure. It's just very time-consuming. It's a way of life. I find that I can work when I travel and work when I run. There is nothing like, on a rainy day, to work.","A city building, you experience when you walk; a suburban building, you experience when you drive.","Every building is a prototype. No two are alike.","For me, drawing generates thinking and vice versa.","When I work, I work very hard. When I don't work, I have to do something where my endeavor can totally take me off what I do professionally, like sailing. It takes all your attention.","Transparency is not the same as looking straight through a building: it's not just a physical idea, it's also an intellectual one.","We want our buildings to work like a machine that will create a pleasurable environment.","I think the younger generation, the people poised to dominate the workforce, are more socially conscious. They are more demanding in terms of environment and how that environment contributes to their life.","A building is hard to judge. It takes many years to find out whether it works. It's not as simple as asking the people in the office whether they like it.","A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes.","America has always imported history.","Chinese buildings are like American buildings, with big footprints. People don't care about daylight or fresh air.","Creativity has more to do with the elimination of the inessential than with inventing something new.","Critics are entitled to have an opinion, but how can they judge how comfortable a building is? No critic is smart enough to judge how a building will perform over time.","For me, though, the fun is over when I get the job.","German and English firms operate internationally, while French firms do not. The only place where they all have work is in China. Anybody can sell himself in China!","Higher ceilings allow the use indirect lighting, which is much healthier and reduces glare.","I strive for an architecture from which nothing can be taken away.","I wanted to improve the suburban office building; to create a great urban space in a suburban environment with all that implies about interaction, collaboration and creativity.","I've never looked at a suburban building as being a minor building and an urban building as being a major building.","In Europe, architects consider themselves artists. They think they're special when they win a competition.","In Europe, they're more demanding, the ones that rent the build ings.","It's my goal to make a building as immaterial as possible. Architecture is a very material thing. It takes a lot of resources, so why not eliminate what you don't need as long as you're able to achieve the same result?","Most architects say: I want to use this type of glass, even if it's too reflective or doesn't let enough light in. However, the use of a certain type of glass might change the comfort level.","Sometimes I have to accept a job I don't really want. Hardly anybody comes up to you with a commission; it's all competitions these days.","The American attitude towards efficiency and execution should always underlie architecture.","The architecture profession has lost a lot of its integrity, especially in the USA. The general architect here has no scruples, no ambitions.","We are creating a unique experience. It's starts with how you see the building from a distance.","We prefer synthetic rather than natural materials. Natural products are almost too valuable. Wood is much harder to produce than metal. And metal is recyclable, while wood isn't.","When I came to America in the '60s, it was the place to be. I wonder if I'd come here today.","When I think of some of my earlier work, it really seems a fortunate coincidence that I succeeded.","You don't know what the Chinese expect in the way of beauty. The presentation is just a farce. You come into a room filled with 50 people and they don't talk to you. There's very little interaction.","You'd never think of taking a cab if you had to walk a mile down Chicago's Michigan Avenue. But in a bad city you take a cab just to go around the corner.","I'm ashamed to be German.","Success on one project does not necessarily mean success in the next project. You've got to be prepared in everything you do.","I find if my body feels well and I exercise regularly, I think better, work better and feel better.","I don't consider myself a star or a celebrity. I'm a simple guy who works a lot.","I'm just a nice and easy person.","I used to buy nice clothes and drive a nice car when I couldn't afford it. But I spent all my money doing it, and now I don't have to. I like nice things. I like to travel in a certain style. I like to live in a nice place.","IBM has a very solid business image.","I think there will be a 200-story skyscraper someday. However, it will require a developer who will not think in conventional terms and for whom economic restraints won't apply."],"Helmut Kohl":["We humans have an abyss inside us. The more power people have, the greater the danger.","In German history, we don't have many reasons to be proud.","I don't want to give myself grades. I will leave evaluation of my achievements to history.","Peace must be more than the absence of war.","Nations with a common currency never went to war against each other. A common currency is more than the money you pay with.","I have every reason, despite the resentment and exasperation, to be proud. I have nothing better to be proud of than being proud of German unity.","I have made a very good living, for more than 30 years, by being underestimated.","I have been underestimated for decades. I have done very well that way.","You didn't just pay lip service to the goal of overcoming the division of Europe and Germany... Rather, you put yourself at the forefront of those who encouraged us on the way to unity.","My childhood ended in 1942. I was 12, and for the next three years, I lived under incessant bombings. It was a life of constant fear.","Gorbachev's legacy is that he called time on communism, partially against his will, but in fact, he finished it off. Without violence. Without bloodshed. Beyond that, I am struggling to think of much else in terms of real legacy.","In a democracy, if you don't get the votes, nothing else is possible, no matter how wonderful your dreams.","Where is Germany now and where does it want to go? It's a question being asked by our partners and allies abroad. We have to return - urgently - to our old dependability. We have to make clear for others what we stand for, where we're headed, and that we know where we belong.","People in Tel Aviv can not imagine, but in 1990, here in Leipzig or Dresden, whoever wanted to buy a car had to wait 14 years. The East Germans worked like people in the West, but the fruits of their labor were harvested by a criminal regime.","For me it is completely clear that our air bases in Germany would be available to the Americans.","George Bush was for me the most important ally on the road to German unity.","Russia is Germany's most important neighbor in the East, and it will remain so.","The army is under orders to defend every place.","The Christian Democrats always made you feel like the poor relation.","We were united not only by political respect for each other, but also by deep mutual sympathy as people.","If a Chancellor is trying to push something through, he must be a man of power. And if he's smart, he knows when the time is ripe. In one case - the euro - I was like a dictator... The euro is a synonym for Europe.","Political life is like this - elections go back and forth. Representative democracy can only be successful if one sits down and says, 'That's it. I will connect myself,' - as I did - 'connect my existence to a political project.' Then you automatically have in your party a lot of people who say, 'If that fails, so do I'.","I experienced Nazism as a child. Like many of my generation, I was motivated by the desire to prevent another war at any price.","The most important rule of the new Europe is: There must never again be violence in Europe.","Europe has, to put it mildly, been in a poor state since the transition to the 21st century. This is down to national issues, European missteps, and an economic and financial crisis that crashed down on us with enough force to dislodge the essential European idea.","Two decisions have damaged the stability both of the euro and of Europe: the premature admission of Greece to the euro area and the breach and subsequent weakening of the stability and growth pact.","Where there is no will, no rules or laws can help.","We all need Europe, not just those of us in Europe. And we Germans need Europe more than the others. Germany is the country with the longest border, the most neighbours, and is, by population and economic strength, the number one in Europe.","I knew that I could never win a referendum in Germany. We would have lost a referendum on the introduction of the euro. That's quite clear. I would have lost, and by seven to three.","When people come to write about my period of office, I would be very happy if they say that I made a contribution to finding the happy medium again for the Germans.","Germany is our fatherland; Europe is our future.","My parents were Christians - Catholics, but not in the close-minded sense. I remember my mother to be a very pious woman, but she was never against other religions.","As a child, I personally didn't really get to know any Jews. I was eight years old when the Night of Broken Glass happened. And Ludwigshafen was purely a workers' city, so we didn't have a very big Jewish community. What I did know about the Jews, I heard from my mother. My mother was very much pro-Jewish.","If one has no compass, when one doesn't know where one stands and where one wants to go, one can deduce that one has no leadership or interest in shaping events.","Isolated decisions, however well-founded they might seem to the individual, and national go-it-alone moves must belong to the past. They should not be the 21st-century method of choice, particularly because the consequences of the European community's actions must often be carried collectively.","I like everything that makes you fat.","Solitary decisions, no matter how well-founded they may appear to individuals, must belong to the past - along with national, unilateralist action.","We Germans have learned from history. We are a peace-loving, freedom-loving people. There is only one place for us in the world: at the side of the free nations.","As a German, in view of the history of World War II and the terrible deeds of the Nazi period, I feel a special obligation to help as much as I can to develop European-Israeli relations and thus contribute to ensuring Israel's future and existence.","Our shared historical experiences led myself and Mitterrand to the decision that we must do everything to prevent further wars.","When I was elected to head the German government, I was fortunate enough to find a partner in Francois Mitterrand.","German and European unification are two sides of the same coin.","It was a stroke of luck that there were about four to six leaders in power in the mid-'80s who really trusted one another and could really make things happen.","There must be no question for us that we in the European Union and the eurozone stand by Greece in solidarity.","I ask myself where Germany stands today and where it wants to go."],"Helmut Lang":["If you really have your own identity you'll keep on doing what you think is really right for you, and you'll also understand the next step you want to take.","If something is good, it doesn't go out of style every six months. The fashion wheel of today doesn't have to go as quickly as it was pushed in the 80's.","I'm really bad at describing my own life.","In the end, I do think it's insulting to men and women to insist that they fit a certain profile. I never understood that.","To grow up under really simple circumstances, and to understand that certain things were ornamental... that made an impression on me as a child and is something I use.","Once I'm committed, I'm unafraid of the outcome.","I think the history and the past we have is just an energy we've built up to do what we do now.","The media is looking every season for a designer to tell a story. I have a long story I have to tell, continuing fluently year after year.","I don't think I'm the one that invented glamour at all.","I have been asked to collaborate with fashion houses using my artwork, which I will probably do.","I have always been interested in materials and in transforming them.","When you're young, you're fearless and more creative, more of an outsider.","In the fashion world if you're successful, everyone loves you, and you have available every service. It's hard to walk away, except it wasn't hard for me. I had my mind completely made up.","I have a lot of insecurities, but you learn from your failures.","I was never so directly inspired by fashion. It always came from somewhere else.","I've never been interested in the event when I'm the center of attention."],"Helmut Newton":["My job as a portrait photographer is to seduce, amuse and entertain.","It's that I don't like white paper backgrounds. A woman does not live in front of white paper. She lives on the street, in a motor car, in a hotel room.","I have mixed feelings about those sorts of things. When I see it done by interesting young people, I think it's very valid. But when established photographers, people in their forties, copy me and get a lot of money, well, I find that to be very stupid.","Technically, I have not changed very much. Ask my assistants. They'll tell you, I am the easiest photographer to work with. I don't have heavy equipment. I work out of one bag.","I like photographing the people I love, the people I admire, the famous, and especially the infamous. My last infamous subject was the extreme right wing French politician Jean-Marie Le Pen.","I spend a lot of time preparing. I think a lot about what I want to do. I have prep books, little notebooks in which I write everything down before a sitting. Otherwise I would forget my ideas.","I used to hate doing color. I hated transparency film. The way I did color was by not wanting to know what kind of film was in my camera.","In the photographs themselves there's a definite contrast between the figures and the location - I like that kind of California backyard look; clapboard houses, staircases outdoors.","I did find a wonderful girl last year, but the photographs that we did were more about motorcars.","I was lucky to have my wife as the art director, and it turned out to be quite something - a great success. I'm very proud of it.","People gave us everything for free. We were allowed only so much film per picture, but there was no limit to the creativity. I like to say that they let us loose like wild dogs in the streets of Paris.","The whole series is black-and-white, so when I went to shoot one of the women I only had black-and-white film with me. She had reddish hair and was a very pretty girl, a nice girl.","They often ask me to shoot for them. But I say no. I think an old guy like me ought not take pages away from young photographers who need the exposure.","Well, it takes a certain amount of money. And I've got to see pictures of the person ahead of time. If I don't like the way the person looks I won't do it."],"Helmut Schmidt":["The biggest room in the world is the room for improvement.","The critical thing about Western democracy is the fact that you usually have a transition of power without bloodshed. That is an enormous advantage. But still, democracy as we know it was only invented recently in the West, historical speaking. It did not really work in ancient Rome. It functioned for less than 200 years in ancient Athens.","I remember the youth movement in 1968. It started on American university campuses as a protest against the Vietnam war, then came to Paris, Frankfurt and Berlin. Within a year, you had an uprising of youth against their elders.","Democracy is not the end point of mankind. There may be developments in many different directions in the coming centuries. Democracy has only existed for about 200 years. It started out with the American Declaration of Independence. The Americans got their ideas from the Europeans, in the main from the French, the Dutch and the British.","Germany is one of the medium powers of the world. It is a non-nuclear power. It is in a lower class than the United States, the Soviet Union, France, the United Kingdom and others.","The British claim to have a special relationship with the U.S., but if you mention this in Washington, no one knows what you are talking about.","People with visions should go to the doctor.","Whoever wants to reach a distant goal must take many small steps.","Britain is less European-minded than Greece.","My education has been pro-England. I have been an England-minded citizen of Hamburg, and I am still in a way English-minded, but I have been disappointed by the Brits over the years.","Farmers are always conservative. They stick to what they have learned from their fathers and from their grandfathers. This is the same all over the globe.","The British are very stubborn. The Queen, the Commonwealth, and the special relationship with the U.S. is much more important than Europe.","I was in government for 13 years and in that time only once met the head of the German security services, and that was because he was an old friend. Otherwise, I carefully avoided having anything to do with these people. They are unavoidable but not really necessary.","When I became a soldier, I was drafted in 1937, and instead of being released two years later, I had to stay on because the war had started in the meantime. I was a soldier for more than eight years, as long a time as I was Chancellor.","Americans tend to feel satisfied within the wide boundaries of that huge, big country.","I had a Jewish grandfather. We managed to hide this fact from the authorities by falsifying documents, my father and I. His father was Jewish, but because my father was an illegitimate child, it was rather easy to pretend that his father was unknown.","Particularly since the computerization of the world, the impact of media has grown enormously. The printed books and the printed media have become less important. Why should somebody read Laozi or Confucius if he can Google?","If I ever had to emigrate, I would probably go to America.","The German public knows me quite well. I have been in their kitchens and living rooms for years.","In a mass television democracy - which all of us nowadays have - it is impossible to take basic political decisions with long-term consequences without the public knowing it, without the public understanding at least some of it, without the public forming its judgment, heterogeneous as it may be.","I will not be remembered in history. I have not been shot. I have not launched any great tragedy or victory. I have not borne any great defeat. It was a very normal - it still is a very normal - human life of a political leader.","Since I came an adult - for more than 45 years - Marcus Aurelius has been my great idol.","The concept of multiculturalism is difficult to make fit with a democratic society."],"Helmut Sohmen":["Ships are like children: they need individual attention.","We believe it is important to have an organisational link in London, still the world's premier maritime centre.","London is the headquarters of the International Maritime Organisation, the location of the largest insurance market, and houses a significant ship-broking community, apart from the many other professional services related to shipping.","In Asia, democracy has been less advanced than elsewhere. And many of these countries haven't done too badly.","We ship owners and our predecessors, all the way back to the dawn of history, operating in majority on private initiative and at our own risk, have been linking the world together much more effectively than governments ever managed to do or will likely ever be capable of doing.","Everybody has to build double-hull tankers, but charterers don't want to pay for the extra costs.","Given the international nature of the tanker industry, it is important that global regimes are applied consistently and universally, not local or regional rules that do not recognise the total commercial and operating backdrop.","We cannot, of course, eliminate all accidents - no industry can do that.","Kagoshima is the first step in our plan to develop increased scheduled air links between Hong Kong and Japan, especially the southern islands of Kyushu and Okinawa.","The old swashbuckling days of the playboy ship owner, of the fellow with no cares in the world who does multimillion dollar deals over coffee, are gone.","If the two largest economies in the world don't show us a good example on trade liberalization, then you can't expect the smaller and weaker economies to take the risks. The initiative, the momentum and the drive really do have to come from Japan and the U.S."],"Hendrik Poinar":["It turns out that there are swaths of habitat in the north of Siberia and Yukon that actually could house a mammoth. Remember, this was a highly plastic animal that lived over tremendous climate variation.","I laughed when Steven Spielberg said that cloning extinct animals was inevitable. But I'm not laughing anymore, at least about mammoths. This is going to happen. It's just a matter of working out the details.","If we brought the mammoth back to Siberia, maybe that would be good for the ecosystems that are changing because of climate change.","There's no environment I can think of that would have remained constant enough to preserve dinosaur DNA.","Typically, there's a drive in science to do something just to say you've done it.","We know African and Asian elephants can interbreed, and they're separated by 5 million to 6 million years.","There is no good scientific reason to bring back an extinct species. Why would one bring them back? To put them in a theme park?","Teeth actually turn out to be one of a couple of good sources of ancient DNA. The teeth, actually the enamel, is quite good at preserving the DNA, so it is a bit of time capsule so to speak.","Every outbreak across the globe today stems from a descendant of the medieval plague.","Scientists have always thought that because mammoths roamed such a huge territory - from Western Europe to Central North America - that North American woolly mammoths were a sideshow of no particular significance to the evolution of the species.","The study of evolution is an evolution in itself.","Nuclear DNA encodes all the proteins and enzymes that make you you, basically.","You can go into caves, and they can maintain constant conditions of temperature and humidity over long periods of time, even though the outside temperature may be way above what it is inside the cave.","I'm not sure the Russians would be happy that their iconic wooly mammoth has North American origins.","When I was a young boy, I used to gaze through the microscope of my father at the insects in amber that he kept in the house. And they were remarkably well preserved, morphologically just phenomenal."],"Hendrik Willem Van Loon":["Somewhere in the world there is an epigram for every dilemma.","The arts are an even better barometer of what is happening in our world than the stock market or the debates in congress."],"Henepola Gunaratana":["Watch the functioning of your own mind in a calm and detached manner so you can gain insight into your own behavior.","The present moment is changing so fast that we often do not notice its existence at all. Every moment of mind is like a series of pictures passing through a projector. Some of the pictures come from sense impressions. Others come from memories of past experiences or from fantasies of the future.","The purpose of meditation is personal transformation.","Mindfulness helps us freeze the frame so that we can become aware of our sensations and experiences as they are, without the distorting coloration of socially conditioned responses or habitual reactions.","When you have learned compassion for yourself, compassion for others is automatic.","You can learn not to want what you want, to recognize desires but not be controlled by them.","You can't ever get everything you want. It is impossible. Luckily, there is another option: You can learn to control your mind, to step outside of the endless cycle of desire and aversion.","Let come what comes, and accommodate yourself to that, whatever it is. If good mental images arise, that is fine. If bad mental images arise, that is fine, too. Look on all of it as equal, and make yourself comfortable with whatever happens.","Don't cling to anything and don't reject anything.","Peace is not a thought, not a concept; it is a nonverbal experience.","By silencing the mind, we can experience real peace. As long as various kinds of thoughts agitate the brain, we don't experience 100 percent peace.","The brain does not manufacture thoughts unless we stimulate it with habitual verbalizing. When we train ourselves by constant practice to stop verbalizing, the brain can experience things as they are.","Meditation changes your character.","Whatever attitudes we habitually use toward ourselves, we will use on others, and whatever attitudes we habitually use toward others, we will use on ourselves."],"Henning Mankell":["I am not afraid of dying. I have lived longer than most people in the world. What scares me is to have a body that works but a brain that is waving goodbye. If that happens, I hope I die quickly.","You can have more than one home. You can carry your roots with you, and decide where they grow.","Many people make the mistake of confusing information with knowledge. They are not the same thing. Knowledge involves the interpretation of information. Knowledge involves listening.","Many words will be written on the wind and the sand, or end up in some obscure digital vault. But the storytelling will go on until the last human being stops listening. Then we can send the great chronicle of humanity out into the endless universe.","When you are around 60, there are certain things that are completely terrifying. One of them is that you have made the wrong choices in life, and now it's too late to do anything about them.","Go to Mozambique! As long as you don't expect to find flawless infrastructure, just go. Because this is a country where people have not quite grown accustomed to tourists. You still feel a genuineness that no longer exists in countries where tourism has been industrially developed.","I realize that Facebook today is a global success with more than 600 million users worldwide. But I also understand, maybe a bit sadly, that it is not for me. Perhaps it is because I am a bit too old? Or perhaps it is because I am more interested in exploring the epic text, which I have lived with for all my life.","One of the agonies of being an author is to know when to stop writing.","I'm not very much of a reader really, because I find much of it very bad, very uninteresting, very speculative.","I live with one foot in the sand and one in the snow. There's European egocentricity, and the African opposite. I normally say that my African experience has made me a better European.","I do not understand how on earth you can become a writer without seeing the world.","It is obviously no secret that I earn a lot of money. But it is also no secret that I give most of it away. I don't live a luxurious life. I drive a small second-hand Fiat. I don't have to worry about money, which is itself a privilege. But I never had any anxiety that I would lose my identity.","Many people say I smile more in Africa than in Sweden.","My father thought, and now I think too, that the system of democracy is entirely based upon the system of justice. If we do not have a system of justice that people believe in, the system of democracy will fail.","Have I ever written anything that has really changed something? What I believe is that you can't change anything without using art. I believe that the drops wear away the stone. I try to be part of that army.","I'm quite sure Shakespeare enjoyed writing Iago much more than he did writing Othello. If you write about someone you love, what the hell are you supposed to say about that person? It's much better to have something between you and your main character that grates.","Sweden is still a very peaceful country to live in. I think that people in Britain have created this mythology about Sweden, that it's a perfect democratic society full of erotically charged girls.","Certainly, I know what it's like to be obsessed. I haven't always been there for my children. They could reach me, but I wasn't always there. But, you know, that's not necessarily anything to do with being a writer. I mean, a taxi driver could have the same problem... Maybe.","When I was a very young author, I knew I needed to build myself a tower outside of Europe. Like when you're a hunter, and build towers to watch the animals move. I knew I would never understand the world without that perspective. I came to Africa for that rational reason, although I love Mozambique now.","I decided to become an author when my grandmother taught me to write, when I was six. I can still recall the sensation of being able to turn words into stories. It was a miracle.","I still have a photo on my wall of the greatest idol I will ever have in my life, and it's myself at eight. Because that's when the forces of imagination have the same value as the real world, when they're an instrument of survival: when my mother disappeared, and I imagined a mother. That was me at my best.","Although I never marched through the streets shouting for Mao, I do believe that the liberation of China at the end of the 1940s was a wonderful thing and to provide its people with a billion pairs of shoes and trousers was a fantastic achievement.","Too often we learn everything about how an African dies, but nothing about how he lives. But they learn and live and love and dream just like we do. That's not to say there are not a hell of a lot of problems in Africa. But there is also another side to that story.","Shakespeare is in many ways an African writer and 'Hamlet' would be seen as a very accurate historical saga about an African kingdom.","I love Sherlock Holmes. There's still an awful lot to steal from Conan Doyle. But within a tradition you can work in many different ways.","I work in an old tradition that goes back to the ancient Greeks. You hold a mirror to crime to see what's happening in society. I could never write a crime story just for the sake of it, because I always want to talk about certain things in society.","My mother did what many men do. She left.","Africa was the most exotic place I could conceive of - the end of the world - and I knew I would go there one day.","I came to Mozambique in 1986, when I first became involved with Teatro Avenida - a theatre company that stages plays concerned with political and social issues.","At the time of independence in 1975, Mozambique was extremely poor. Many Portuguese residents abandoned the country, leaving only a handful of well-educated Mozambicans to try to run the country.","The wonderful Mozambican people have endured tremendous misery without losing their dignity and their positive outlook on life. Moreover, they have not lost their will to progress and develop. Mozambique is a country where the people never surrendered.","I am fascinated by all the new technology that creates places for us to meet in what is called cyberspace. I understand what it must have meant for the rebellions in the 19th century, especially in 1830 and 1848, when the mass circulated newspaper became so important for the spreading of information.","An oppressed people will always rise.","As a writer, I am an intellectual. I believe in the ideals of the Enlightenment, I believe in the written word, in dialogue and in truth. I hate lies more than anything else. Most of the time I react by writing.","The fundamental driving force for me is to create a change in the world we live in... It is about exploitation, plundering and degradation. I have a small possibility to participate in the resistance. Most of the things that I do are part of a resistance, a form of solidarity work.","In Africa, listening is a guiding principle. It's a principle that's been lost in the constant chatter of the Western world, where no one seems to have the time or even the desire to listen to anyone else.","What differentiates us from animals is the fact that we can listen to other people's dreams, fears, joys, sorrows, desires and defeats - and they in turn can listen to ours.","Normally street children are shown in terms of the tragedy of their lives - which is true - but there's also another dimension: their wisdom, dignity and enormous capacity for survival.","There is always a sacred hour in the theatre - after rehearsals and before performances, in the afternoon, between three and five o'clock. Normally the theatre is empty then, and this is a wonderful hour.","I think my Wallander stories give a fairly good image of the world in the 1990s. I don't regret anything about that - on the contrary!","I work every day until I do not have more to say. I learned from Graham Greene that a very good way is to stop work in the middle of a sentence. Then you know exactly how to continue the day after.","When someone asks me to list the 10 best novels ever written, I always refuse to answer.","Although many of his other novels are brilliant there is a power in 'Oliver Twist' that I believe Dickens never managed to retrieve. It is as if he was sent to this earth with the sole purpose of writing this book.","For me 'Oliver Twist' is a political novel. It is a furious critique of the treatment of orphans and poor children who were forced to spend their early lives in ghastly institutions.","I would say that during my lifetime, one of the worst political scandals in Sweden was absolutely what happened surrounding the affair of the submarines in Swedish waters in 1982, where there were supposed to be Russian submarines close to Stockholm. And the military of Sweden never got one up.","Well, I believe that life is very complicated. And in a way, the only way you can show life in a truthful way is to show how complicated it is as an individual, but also your relation between a complicated life and the complications you have inside you.","I can still remember. I was ill, and I was seven, and my father didn't want me to just read children's books. He came with Conan Doyle. I tried, and I liked it. I think the first I read was 'The Sign of the Four'; 'Study in Scarlet' was the next one. Then I guess I stayed home a few extra days from school to read.","I am a very radical person - as radical now as I was when I was younger. So my books all have in common my search for understanding of the terrible world we are living in and ways to change it."],"Henny Youngman":["If you're going to do something tonight that you'll be sorry for tomorrow morning, sleep late.","Some people ask the secret of our long marriage. We take time to go to a restaurant two times a week. A little candlelight, dinner, soft music and dancing. She goes Tuesdays, I go Fridays.","The secret of a happy marriage remains a secret.","I told the doctor I broke my leg in two places. He told me to quit going to those places.","I've been in love with the same woman for forty-one years. If my wife finds out, she'll kill me.","I once wanted to become an atheist, but I gave up - they have no holidays.","When God sneezed, I didn't know what to say.","When I read about the evils of drinking, I gave up reading.","If at first you don't succeed... so much for skydiving.","If my mother knew I did this for a living, she'd kill me. She thinks I'm selling dope.","You can't buy love, but you can pay heavily for it.","A Jewish woman had two chickens. One got sick, so the woman made chicken soup out of the other one to help the sick one get well.","My wife dresses to kill. She cooks the same way.","I take my wife everywhere, but she keeps finding her way back.","A doctor gave a man six months to live. The man couldn't pay his bill, so he gave him another six months.","This is an elegant hotel! Room service has an unlisted number.","My other brother-in-law died. He was a karate expert, then joined the army. The first time he saluted, he killed himself.","Just got back from a pleasure trip: I took my mother-in-law to the airport.","I've got all the money I'll ever need, if I die by four o'clock.","Do you know what it means to come home at night to a woman who'll give you a little love, a little affection, a little tenderness? It means you're in the wrong house, that's what it means.","This man used to go to school with his dog. Then they were separated. His dog graduated!","Take my wife... Please!","A self-taught man usually has a poor teacher and a worse student.","She's a big-hearted girl with hips to match.","My grandmother is over eighty and still doesn't need glasses. Drinks right out of the bottle.","While playing golf today I hit two good balls. I stepped on a rake.","The horse I bet on was so slow, the jockey kept a diary of the trip.","You have a nice personality, but not for a human being.","I played a great horse yesterday! It took seven horses to beat him.","I know a man who doesn't pay to have his trash taken out. How does he get rid of his trash? He gift wraps it, and puts in into an unlocked car.","I played a lot of tough clubs in my time. Once a guy in one of those clubs wanted to bet me $10 that I was dead. I was afraid to bet.","Why do Jewish men die before their wives? They want to.","When I told my doctor I couldn't afford an operation, he offered to touch-up my X-rays.","You have a ready wit. Tell me when it's ready.","There was a girl knocking on my hotel room door all night! Finally, I let her out.","My dad was the town drunk. Most of the time that's not so bad; but New York City?","How to drive a guy crazy: send him a telegram and on the top put 'page 2.'","My brother was a lifeguard in a car wash.","Why don't Jews drink? It interferes with their suffering.","That was the first time I saw a horse start from a kneeling position!","Those two are a fastidious couple. She's fast and he's hideous.","What's the use of happiness? It can't buy you money.","If you had your life to live over again, do it overseas.","My son complains about headaches. I tell him all the time, when you get out of bed, it's feet first!","She has a wash and wear bridal gown.","She's been married so many times she has rice marks on her face.","This man is frank and earnest with women. In Fresno, he's Frank and in Chicago he's Ernest.","Why do Jewish divorces cost so much? They're worth it.","You look like a talent scout for a cemetery."],"Henri Barbusse":["Two armies that fight each other is like one large army that commits suicide.","I see too deep and too much.","It is not a woman I want - it is all women."],"Henri Bergson":["To exist is to change, to change is to mature, to mature is to go on creating oneself endlessly.","There is no greater joy than that of feeling oneself a creator. The triumph of life is expressed by creation.","Homo sapiens, the only creature endowed with reason, is also the only creature to pin its existence on things unreasonable.","Think like a man of action, act like a man of thought.","An absolute can only be given in an intuition, while all the rest has to do with analysis.","The major task of the twentieth century will be to explore the unconscious, to investigate the subsoil of the mind.","Genius is that which forces the inertia of humanity to learn.","The present contains nothing more than the past, and what is found in the effect was already in the cause.","Wherever anything lives, there is, open somewhere, a register in which time is being inscribed.","To perceive means to immobilize... we seize, in the act of perception, something which outruns perception itself.","Some other faculty than the intellect is necessary for the apprehension of reality.","When we make the cerebral state the beginning of an action, and in no sense the condition of a perception, we place the perceived images of things outside the image of our body, and thus replace perception within the things themselves.","You will obtain a vision of matter that is perhaps fatiguing for your imagination, but pure and stripped of what the requirements of life make you add to it in external perception.","Sex appeal is the keynote of our civilization.","Religion is to mysticism what popularization is to science.","In just the same way the thousands of successive positions of a runner are contracted into one sole symbolic attitude, which our eye perceives, which art reproduces, and which becomes for everyone the image of a man who runs.","In its entirety, probably, it follows us at every instant; all that we have felt, thought and willed from our earliest infancy is there, leaning over the present which is about to join it, pressing against the portals of consciousness that would fain leave it outside.","In laughter we always find an unavowed intention to humiliate and consequently to correct our neighbour.","The motive power of democracy is love.","Spirit borrows from matter the perceptions on which it feeds and restores them to matter in the form of movements which it has stamped with its own freedom.","There is nothing in philosophy which could not be said in everyday language.","A situation is always comic if it participates simultaneously in two series of events which are absolutely independent of each other, and if it can be interpreted in two quite different meanings.","I see plainly how external images influence the image that I call my body: they transmit movement to it.","Intelligence is the faculty of making artificial objects, especially tools to make tools.","The only cure for vanity is laughter, and the only fault that is laughable is vanity.","I cannot escape the objection that there is no state of mind, however simple, that does not change every moment.","For life is tendency, and the essence of a tendency is to develop in the form of a sheaf, creating, by its very growth, divergent directions among which its impetus is divided.","We regard intelligence as man's main characteristic and we know that there is no superiority which intelligence cannot confer on us, no inferiority for which it cannot compensate.","It seems that laughter needs an echo.","In reality, the past is preserved by itself automatically.","Our laughter is always the laughter of a group.","And I also see how this body influences external images: it gives back movement to them.","Life does not proceed by the association and addition of elements, but by dissociation and division.","Instinct perfected is a faculty of using and even constructing organized instruments; intelligence perfected is the faculty of making and using unorganized instruments."],"Henri Cartier-Bresson":["Photography is an immediate reaction, drawing is a meditation.","The photograph itself doesn't interest me. I want only to capture a minute part of reality.","The most difficult thing for me is a portrait. You have to try and put your camera between the skin of a person and his shirt.","During the work, you have to be sure that you haven't left any holes, that you've captured everything, because afterwards it will be too late.","In photography, the smallest thing can be a great subject. The little, human detail can become a Leitmotiv.","The creative act lasts but a brief moment, a lightning instant of give-and-take, just long enough for you to level the camera and to trap the fleeting prey in your little box.","To take photographs means to recognize - simultaneously and within a fraction of a second - both the fact itself and the rigorous organization of visually perceived forms that give it meaning. It is putting one's head, one's eye and one's heart on the same axis.","Above all, I craved to seize the whole essence, in the confines of one single photograph, of some situation that was in the process of unrolling itself before my eyes.","To me, photography is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event.","Memory is very important, the memory of each photo taken, flowing at the same speed as the event. During the work, you have to be sure that you haven't left any holes, that you've captured everything, because afterwards it will be too late.","We photographers deal in things which are continually vanishing, and when they have vanished there is no contrivance on earth can make them come back again. We cannot develop and print a memory.","To photograph is to hold one's breath, when all faculties converge to capture fleeting reality. It's at that precise moment that mastering an image becomes a great physical and intellectual joy.","Photographers deal in things which are continually vanishing and when they have vanished there is no contrivance on earth which can make them come back again.","Actually, I'm not all that interested in the subject of photography. Once the picture is in the box, I'm not all that interested in what happens next. Hunters, after all, aren't cooks.","Think about the photo before and after, never during. The secret is to take your time. You mustn't go too fast. The subject must forget about you. Then, however, you must be very quick."],"Henri Coanda":["These airplanes we have today are no more than a perfection of a child's toy made of paper.","I imagine a future aircraft, which will take off vertically, fly as usual, and land vertically. This flying machine should have no moving parts. This idea came from the huge power of cyclones.","In my opinion, we should search for a completely different flying machine, based on other flying principles."],"Henri Frederic Amiel":["There is no respect for others without humility in one's self.","Destiny has two ways of crushing us - by refusing our wishes and by fulfilling them.","Everything you need for better future and success has already been written. And guess what? All you have to do is go to the library.","Life is short and we have never too much time for gladdening the hearts of those who are travelling the dark journey with us. Oh be swift to love, make haste to be kind.","Thankfulness is the beginning of gratitude. Gratitude is the completion of thankfulness. Thankfulness may consist merely of words. Gratitude is shown in acts.","Any landscape is a condition of the spirit.","To know how to suggest is the great art of teaching. To attain it we must be able to guess what will interest; we must learn to read the childish soul as we might a piece of music. Then, by simply changing the key, we keep up the attraction and vary the song.","Every life is a profession of faith, and exercises an inevitable and silent influence.","The best path through life is the highway.","Man becomes man only by his intelligence, but he is man only by his heart.","Materialism coarsens and petrifies everything, making everything vulgar, and every truth false.","Common sense is calculation applied to life.","Analysis kills spontaneity. The grain once ground into flour springs and germinates no more.","We are never more discontented with others than when we are discontented with ourselves.","Truth is not only violated by falsehood; it may be equally outraged by silence.","The man who has no inner-life is a slave to his surroundings.","An error is the more dangerous in proportion to the degree of truth which it contains.","Self-interest is but the survival of the animal in us. Humanity only begins for man with self-surrender.","In health there is freedom. Health is the first of all liberties.","True humility is contentment.","Learn to... be what you are, and learn to resign with a good grace all that you are not.","Women wish to be loved without a why or a wherefore; not because they are pretty, or good, or well-bred, or graceful, or intelligent, but because they are themselves.","It is by teaching that we teach ourselves, by relating that we observe, by affirming that we examine, by showing that we look, by writing that we think, by pumping that we draw water into the well.","Clever people will recognize and tolerate nothing but cleverness.","The test of every religious, political, or educational system is the man that it forms.","Cleverness is serviceable for everything, sufficient for nothing.","I'm not interested in age. People who tell me their age are silly. You're as old as you feel.","Charm is the quality in others, that makes us more satisfied with ourselves.","Sacrifice still exists everywhere, and everywhere the elect of each generation suffers for the salvation of the rest.","Uncertainty is the refuge of hope.","Music is harmony, harmony is perfection, perfection is our dream, and our dream is heaven.","Thought is a kind of opium; it can intoxicate us, while still broad awake; it can make transparent the mountains and everything that exists.","Conquering any difficulty always gives one a secret joy, for it means pushing back a boundary-line and adding to one's liberty.","Our duty is to be useful, not according to our desires but according to our powers.","Doing easily what others find difficult is talent; doing what is impossible for talent is genius.","Woman is the salvation or the destruction of the family. She carries its destiny in the folds of her mantle.","We only understand that which already is within us.","Work while you have the light. You are responsible for the talent that has been entrusted to you.","To do easily what is difficult for others is the mark of talent. To do what is impossible for talent is the mark of genius.","Action and faith enslave thought, both of them in order not be troubled or inconvenienced by reflection, criticism, and doubt.","For purposes of action nothing is more useful than narrowness of thought combined with energy of will.","It is not what he had, or even what he does which expresses the worth of a man, but what he is.","Common sense is the measure of the possible; it is composed of experience and prevision; it is calculation applied to life.","Pure truth cannot be assimilated by the crowd; it must be communicated by contagion.","To live we must conquer incessantly, we must have the courage to be happy.","In every loving woman there is a priestess of the past - a pious guardian of some affection, of which the object has disappeared.","To marry unequally is to suffer equally.","The fire which enlightens is the same fire which consumes.","Society lives by faith, and develops by science.","Order is a great person's need and their true well being.","Order is power.","The man who insists upon seeing with perfect clearness before he decides, never decides. Accept life, and you must accept regret.","Sympathy is the first condition of criticism.","To shun one's cross is to make it heavier.","Sacrifice, which is the passion of great souls, has never been the law of societies.","He who asks of life nothing but the improvement of his own nature... is less liable than anyone else to miss and waste life.","The only substance properly so called is the soul.","If nationality is consent, the state is compulsion.","Tears are the symbol of the inability of the soul to restrain its emotion and retain its self command.","Action is coarsened thought; thought becomes concrete, obscure, and unconscious.","So long as a person is capable of self-renewal they are a living being.","Without passion man is a mere latent force and possibility, like the flint which awaits the shock of the iron before it can give forth its spark.","Let us be true: this is the highest maxim of art and of life, the secret of eloquence and of virtue, and of all moral authority.","Blessed be childhood, which brings down something of heaven into the midst of our rough earthliness.","Tell me what you feel in your room when the full moon is shining in upon you and your lamp is dying out, and I will tell you how old you are, and I shall know if you are happy.","Our systems, perhaps, are nothing more than an unconscious apology for our faults, a gigantic scaffolding whose object is to hide from us our favorite sin."],"Henri La Fontaine":["Belgium thinks that however great the peril which a country might have to undergo under the system which we seek to establish here, that country ought to do its duty.","Peoples will be as before, the sheep sent to the slaughterhouses or to the meadows as it pleases the shepherds.","International institutions ought to be, as the national ones in democratic countries, established by the peoples and for the peoples."],"Henri Matisse":["There are always flowers for those who want to see them.","Impressionism is the newspaper of the soul.","Creativity takes courage.","What I dream of is an art of balance, of purity and serenity devoid of troubling or depressing subject matter - a soothing, calming influence on the mind, rather like a good armchair which provides relaxation from physical fatigue.","Drawing is like making an expressive gesture with the advantage of permanence.","There is nothing more difficult for a truly creative painter than to paint a rose, because before he can do so he has first to forget all the roses that were ever painted.","Derive happiness in oneself from a good day's work, from illuminating the fog that surrounds us.","I would like to recapture that freshness of vision which is characteristic of extreme youth when all the world is new to it.","A picture must possess a real power to generate light and for a long time now I've been conscious of expressing myself through light or rather in light.","An artist must possess Nature. He must identify himself with her rhythm, by efforts that will prepare the mastery which will later enable him to express himself in his own language.","It is only after years of preparation that the young artist should touch color - not color used descriptively, that is, but as a means of personal expression.","With color one obtains an energy that seems to stem from witchcraft.","I do not literally paint that table, but the emotion it produces upon me.","I have always tried to hide my efforts and wished my works to have a light joyousness of springtime which never lets anyone suspect the labors it has cost me.","He who loves, flies, runs, and rejoices; he is free and nothing holds him back.","Exactitude is not truth.","In the beginning you must subject yourself to the influence of nature. You must be able to walk firmly on the ground before you start walking on a tightrope.","You study, you learn, but you guard the original naivete. It has to be within you, as desire for drink is within the drunkard or love is within the lover.","I wouldn't mind turning into a vermilion goldfish.","I don't paint things. I only paint the difference between things.","It has bothered me all my life that I do not paint like everybody else.","An artist must never be a prisoner. Prisoner? An artist should never be a prisoner of himself, prisoner of style, prisoner of reputation, prisoner of success, etc.","I don't know whether I believe in God or not. I think, really, I'm some sort of Buddhist. But the essential thing is to put oneself in a frame of mind which is close to that of prayer.","Instinct must be thwarted just as one prunes the branches of a tree so that it will grow better.","Time extracts various values from a painter's work. When these values are exhausted the pictures are forgotten, and the more a picture has to give, the greater it is.","I'm growing old, I delight in the past.","Work cures everything.","Cutting into color reminds me of the sculptor's direct carving.","A young woman has young claws, well sharpened. If she has character, that is. And if she hasn't so much the worse for you.","My curves are not crazy.","I have been no more than a medium, as it were.","In love, the one who runs away is the winner.","Jazz is rhythm and meaning."],"Henri Nouwen":["Did I offer peace today? Did I bring a smile to someone's face? Did I say words of healing? Did I let go of my anger and resentment? Did I forgive? Did I love? These are the real questions. I must trust that the little bit of love that I sow now will bear many fruits, here in this world and the life to come.","Each day holds a surprise. But only if we expect it can we see, hear, or feel it when it comes to us. Let's not be afraid to receive each day's surprise, whether it comes to us as sorrow or as joy It will open a new place in our hearts, a place where we can welcome new friends and celebrate more fully our shared humanity.","The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion, who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement, who can tolerate not knowing... not healing, not curing... that is a friend who cares.","If fear is the great enemy of intimacy, love is its true friend.","When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives means the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand.","Friendship has always belonged to the core of my spiritual journey.","The spiritual life is not a life before, after, or beyond our everyday existence. No, the spiritual life can only be real when it is lived in the midst of the pains and joys of the here and now.","Perhaps nothing helps us make the movement from our little selves to a larger world than remembering God in gratitude. Such a perspective puts God in view in all of life, not just in the moments we set aside for worship or spiritual disciplines. Not just in the moments when life seems easy.","Solitude is very different from a 'time-out' from our busy lives. Solitude is the very ground from which community grows. Whenever we pray alone, study, read, write, or simply spend quiet time away from the places where we interact with each other directly, we are potentially opened for a deeper intimacy with each other.","Jesus didn't say, 'Blessed are those who care for the poor.' He said, 'Blessed are we where we are poor, where we are broken.' It is there that God loves us deeply and pulls us into deeper communion with himself.","The greatest trap in our life is not success, popularity or power, but self-rejection.","To learn patience is not to rebel against every hardship.","Spiritual identity means we are not what we do or what people say about us. And we are not what we have. We are the beloved daughters and sons of God.","One of the main tasks of theology is to find words that do not divide but unite, that do not create conflict but unity, that do not hurt but heal.","The real enemies of our life are the 'oughts' and the 'ifs.' They pull us backward into the unalterable past and forward into the unpredictable future. But real life takes place in the here and now.","The discipline of gratitude is the explicit effort to acknowledge that all I am and have is given to me as a gift of love, a gift to be celebrated with joy.","Intimacy is not a happy medium. It is a way of being in which the tension between distance and closeness is dissolved and a new horizon appears. Intimacy is beyond fear.","Somewhere we know that without silence words lose their meaning, that without listening speaking no longer heals, that without distance closeness cannot cure.","Just as people can watch spellbound a circus artist tumbling through the air in a phosphorized costume, so they can listen to a preacher who uses the Word of God to draw attention to himself. But a sensational preacher stimulates the senses and leaves the spirit untouched. Instead of being the way to God, his 'being different' gets in the way.","I have an increasing sense that the most important crisis of our time is spiritual and that we need places where people can grow stronger in the spirit and be able to integrate the emotional struggles in their spiritual journeys.","To give someone a blessing is the most significant affirmation we can offer.","God wants you to live for others and to live that presence well.","Our efforts to disconnect ourselves from our own suffering end up disconnecting our suffering from God's suffering for us. The way out of our loss and hurt is in and through.","Waiting is a period of learning. The longer we wait, the more we hear about him for whom we are waiting.","The fruits of your labors may be reaped two generations from now. Trust, even when you don't see the results.","Prayer is the most concrete way to make our home in God.","In solitude we become aware that we were together before we came together and that life is not a creation of our will but rather an obedient response to the reality of our being united.","Ministry is the least important thing. You cannot not minister if you are in communion with God and live in community.","The man who can articulate the movements of his inner life need no longer be a victim of himself, but is able slowly and consistently to remove the obstacles that prevent the spirit from entering.","Peacemaking is a full-time vocation that includes each member of God's people.","One of the most beautiful ways for spiritual formation to take place is to let your insecurity lead you closer to the Lord. Natural hypersensitivity can become an asset; it makes you aware of your need to be with people and it allows you to be more willing to look at their needs.","In our production-oriented society, being busy, having an occupation, has become one of the main ways, if not the main way, of identifying ourselves. Without an occupation, not just our economic security but our very identity is endangered.","Too many of us are lonely ministers practicing a lonely ministry.","Discipline means to prevent everything in your life from being filled up. Discipline means that somewhere you're not occupied, and certainly not preoccupied. In the spiritual life, discipline means to create that space in which something can happen that you hadn't planned or counted on.","God is a God of the present. God is always in the moment, be that moment hard or easy, joyful and painful.","For Jesus, there are no countries to be conquered, no ideologies to be imposed, no people to be dominated. There are only children, women and men to be loved.","Fear is the great enemy of intimacy. Fear makes us run away from each other or cling to each other but does not create true intimacy.","When you recognize the festive and the still moments as moments of prayer, then you gradually realize that to pray is to live.","People with handicaps teach me that being is more important than doing, the heart is more important than the mind, and caring together is better than caring alone.","The Christian leaders of the future have to be theologians, persons who know the heart of God and are trained - through prayer, study, and careful analysis - to manifest the divine event of God's saving work in the midst of the many seemingly random events of their time.","To be a Christian who is willing to travel with Christ on his downward road requires being willing to detach oneself constantly from any need to be relevant, and to trust ever more deeply the Word of God.","The Christian leader of the future is called to be completely irrelevant and to stand in this world with nothing to offer but his or her own vulnerable self. God loves us, not because of what we do or accomplish, but because God has created and redeemed us in love.","Much violence is based on the illusion that life is a property to be defended and not to be shared.","Our inclination is to show our Lord only what we feel comfortable with. But the more we dare to reveal our whole trembling self to him, the more we will be able to sense that his love, which is perfect love, casts out all our fears.","Solitude is the place where we can connect with profound bonds that are deeper than the emergency bonds of fear and anger.","Our Western society is showing its technological muscles in ever more threatening ways, but the experience of fear, anxiety and even despair has increased in equal proportion. Indeed, the paradox is that the powerful giants feel as powerless as a new-born babe.","'How much longer will I live?'... Only one thing seems clear to me. Every day should be well-lived. What a simple truth! Still, it is worthy of my attention.","I've had a tremendous problem with depression in my life. I'd rather not talk about it, because it's over. But depression is real.","Living in a community with very wounded people, I came to see that I had lived most of my life as a tightrope artist trying to walk on a high, thin cable from one tower to the other, always waiting for the applause when I had not fallen off and broken my leg.","Our glory is hidden in our pain, if we allow God to bring the gift of himself in our experience of it.","In their poverty, the mentally handicapped reveal God to us and hold us close to the gospel.","The evangelical movement has become just a bit victimized by a success-oriented culture, wanting the church - like the corporation - to be successful.","The journey from teaching about love to allowing myself to be loved proved much longer than I realised.","Ministers are powerless people who have nothing to boast of except their weaknesses. But when the Lord whom they serve fills them with His blessing they will move mountains and change the hearts of people wherever they go.","Most Christian leadership is exercised by people who do not know how to develop healthy, intimate relationships and have opted for power and control instead. Many Christian empire-builders have been people unable to give and receive love.","A life without a lonely place, that is, without a quiet center, becomes destructive.","Prayer is the beginning and the end, the source and the fruit, the core and the content, the basis and the goal of all peacemaking.","The resistance to praying is like the resistance of tightly clenched fists. This image shows a tension, a desire to cling tightly to yourself, a greediness which betrays fear.","To be a minister means above all to become powerless, or in more precise terms, to speak with our powerlessness to the condition of powerlessness which is so keenly felt but so seldom expressed by the people of our age.","When we have nothing to cling to as our own and cease thinking of ourselves as people who must defend privileges, we can open ourselves freely to others with the faithful expectation that our strength will manifest itself in our shared weakness.","Asking people for money is giving them the opportunity to put their resources at the disposal of the Kingdom.","As peacemakers, we must resist all the powers of war and destruction and proclaim that peace is the divine gift offered to all who affirm life. Resistance means saying 'No' to all the forces of death, wherever they may be.","Our first responsibility in the midst of violence is to prevent it from destroying us."],"Henri Pirenne":["The cause of the break with the tradition of antiquity was the rapid and unexpected advance of Islam. The result of this advance was the final separation of East from West, and the end of the Mediterranean unity.","The Germanic invasions in the West could not and did not in any way alter this state of affairs.","The Germanic invasions destroyed neither the Mediterranean unity of the ancient world, nor what may be regarded as the truly essential features of the Roman culture as it still existed in the 5th century, at a time when there was no longer an Emperor in the West."],"Henri Poincare":["Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things.","It is through science that we prove, but through intuition that we discover.","It is the harmony of the diverse parts, their symmetry, their happy balance; in a word it is all that introduces order, all that gives unity, that permits us to see clearly and to comprehend at once both the ensemble and the details.","Thought is only a flash between two long nights, but this flash is everything.","Science is built up of facts, as a house is with stones. But a collection of facts is no more a science than a heap of stones is a house.","Mathematicians are born, not made.","If one looks at the different problems of the integral calculus which arise naturally when one wishes to go deep into the different parts of physics, it is impossible not to be struck by the analogies existing.","What is it indeed that gives us the feeling of elegance in a solution, in a demonstration?","Ideas rose in clouds; I felt them collide until pairs interlocked, so to speak, making a stable combination.","The scientist does not study nature because it is useful; he studies it because he delights in it, and he delights in it because it is beautiful.","To doubt everything, or, to believe everything, are two equally convenient solutions; both dispense with the necessity of reflection.","Geometry is not true, it is advantageous.","Mathematicians do not study objects, but relations between objects.","Facts do not speak.","It is far better to foresee even without certainty than not to foresee at all.","A scientist worthy of his name, about all a mathematician, experiences in his work the same impression as an artist; his pleasure is as great and of the same nature.","It has adopted the geometry most advantageous to the species or, in other words, the most convenient.","A very small cause which escapes our notice determines a considerable effect that we cannot fail to see, and then we say that the effect is due to chance.","Hypotheses are what we lack the least.","Science is facts.","A sane mind should not be guilty of a logical fallacy, yet there are very fine minds incapable of following mathematical demonstrations.","Need we add that mathematicians themselves are not infallible?","If nature were not beautiful, it would not be worth knowing, and if nature were not worth knowing, life would not be worth living.","The mind uses its faculty for creativity only when experience forces it to do so.","Mathematical discoveries, small or great are never born of spontaneous generation.","The mathematical facts worthy of being studied are those which, by their analogy with other facts, are capable of leading us to the knowledge of a physical law.","Just as houses are made of stones, so is science made of facts.","In the old days when people invented a new function they had something useful in mind.","How is an error possible in mathematics?","Point set topology is a disease from which the human race will soon recover.","No more than these machines need the mathematician know what he does.","Thus, they are free to replace some objects by others so long as the relations remain unchanged.","Absolute space, that is to say, the mark to which it would be necessary to refer the earth to know whether it really moves, has no objective existence.","One would have to have completely forgotten the history of science so as to not remember that the desire to know nature has had the most constant and the happiest influence on the development of mathematics.","Invention consists in avoiding the constructing of useless contraptions and in constructing the useful combinations which are in infinite minority.","To invent is to discern, to choose.","If we knew exactly the laws of nature and the situation of the universe at the initial moment, we could predict exactly the situation of the same universe at a succeeding moment.","If that enabled us to predict the succeeding situation with the same approximation, that is all we require, and we should say that the phenomenon had been predicted, that it is governed by the laws.","A small error in the former will produce an enormous error in the latter."],"Henri Rousseau":["If a king tries to start a war, a mother should go to him and forbid it.","Nothing makes me so happy as to observe nature and to paint what I see.","I cannot now change my style, which I acquired, as you can imagine, by dint of labour.","Excuse my scribbling, it is late, and I have a poor candle.","It is often said that my heart is too open for my own good."],"Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec":["The body of a beautiful woman is not made for love; it is too exquisite.","My dear Mama, you are definitely the hen who hatched a famous duck.","I paint things as they are. I don't comment.","Never be tempted by water. The water tap should be sealed at lunchtime. If, for example, a sauce goes wrong, adding water doesn't help at all; one only achieves a taste of dishwater.","The cafes bore me; going downstairs is a nuisance. Painting and sleeping - that's all there is.","Love is when the desire to be desired takes you so badly that you feel you could die of it.","The harmony of the luncheon is achieved by a combination of the two main courses which are the focus of the menu.","Of course one should not drink much, but often.","I have tried to do what is true and not ideal.","I have always been a pencil.","Philandering impedes, as everyone knows, the ability to concentrate."],"Henrietta Szold":["In the life of the spirit there is no ending that is not a beginning.","I would exchange everything for one child of my own.","Women were freed from positive duties when they could not perform them, but not when they could.","To the rest of us the supreme vindication of the scholar's view lies in their invincible allegiance to the Jewish heritage - a steadfastness that has been matched only by that of their rescuers."],"Henrik Dam":["In plants, vitamin K is found principally in all kinds of green leaves; leaves which have grown in the dark and therefore have not formed chlorophyll are poor sources.","The discovery of vitamin K arose from some studies on the cholesterol metabolism of chicks carried out during the years 1928-1930 in the Biochemical Institute of the University of Copenhagen.","The letter K was the first one in the alphabet which had not, with more or less justification, been used to designate other vitamins, and it also happened to be the first letter in the word 'koagulation' according to the Scandinavian and German spelling.","The hemorrhages in vitamin K deficiency develop in this way that minute vascular lesions caused by minor mechanical trauma are not closed by rapid clotting, as is the case in normal animals."],"Henrik Fisker":["If you think about jeans or phones or television, we are used to new brands popping up right and left. But in the car industry, we grew up with Mercedes, BMW, General Motors, and Ford, and nobody can remember during his or her upbringing a new car brand coming to life.","In this industry, you have to have passion. It's tough; there's no mercy. But I just love cars - I love to bring a new car to market. And every time I do this, it gets a little easier.","The car industry has invested a lot in hybrid, but my opinion is electric cars will take over a lot of hybrids quicker than people think now.","At a European auto show, I had someone from a German car company come up to me and say the Karma should cost $125,000, not $87,900, but our development process lets us lower the costs. I guarantee it's profitable.","The implementation of autonomous driving needs a whole new rethinking. To really make it an attribute for society, we really need to think differently about where and when and how we implement this.","People feel very emotional about cars, and I don't want them to feel bad about driving a fast car.","Tesla has defied everyone's predictions again and again. It has such a unique position in the market, and so far, whatever people think about Tesla and its business model, there is one fact that nobody can dispute: It pretty much has the market to itself.","When I was at BMW and Aston Martin, I realized how difficult and how many resources it takes to create a car - let alone a car company.","We still haven't seen any cars take advantage of the electric powertrain in terms of how you proportion an electric vehicle versus traditional vehicles. Yes there's electric cars, but they haven't really done it in a beautiful way.","I've always wanted to design a Mustang. I just never really had the opportunity in my career because the timing was never right.","I remember, as a kid, riding in the back of my dad's old Saab 95 in Denmark. We were on the highway, and suddenly this silver Maserati Bora came upon us, then passed. At the time, to me, this car looked like a spaceship.","I believe there's still room for the dream a lot of people in the industry have - to design and build your own cars.","Design - pure beauty - will be number one at Fisker Coachbuild. We want to bring beautiful, desirable cars to the market, limit the production of each model, and do so with the highest quality.","We designed a car that is for daily commutes and that you charge every day. The less you use the gasoline engine, the better mpg. Essentially, the Karma can achieve dramatic savings and low CO2 output when used as intended, as a daily commuter.","We believe that there are many buyers who want a stylish, sporty car that sends a positive message about their concern for the environment as they drive it down the street.","I have a 100-mile round trip commute on some of the nations' busiest roads and enjoy every minute of it.","You always have to stimulate the senses.","A painting doesn't have to have a real usability other than you looking at it. Obviously, a car, an engine, or battery has to fit people's needs.","I like to come up first of all with a free idea, thinking about and obviously understanding what is necessary for it to become a car.","Once investors come in, it's hardly your company anymore!","One of the big failures for the big auto companies is that even the CEO and the top management often don't understand design and manufacturing. As a CEO, you have to make decisions; you need to have knowledge.","The car is the most regulated thing in the world. It's more complicated to make a car than it is to send a rocket to space.","The biggest challenge is to build the team and start the company, while hiring people, raising money, building a brand which has no history, all at the same time. You're doing a lot of things that in an established company are already done.","I could imagine that boats sailing in harbors will only use electric engines. And then once they are out in the water they will use diesel.","Any car designer always dreams about designing their own car - if they say they don't, they're lying... For me, it was never about starting my own company just to make another car.","I like doing business with people in India.","I want to explore the existing manufacturing abilities of Indian companies and create products together.","My motivation for starting Fisker was simple: I thought there must be a market for beautiful, exciting, fast, environmentally friendly cars. The car is probably the only product you can still fall in love with and have a relationship with.","You need to focus on creating the actual value of the company, not just the theoretical value. The actual value comes from a great product that sells well and is ultimately profitable.","I used to have to pick up the phone and talk to people who placed orders for the car. When you reach a certain size, you need to have processes in place.","I come from Denmark; Fisker Automotive comes from California.","When we first showed the Karma in January 2008, we had barely started the company.","You know what? Starting a car company is risky.","Most automakers develop multiple options for a single project. Then they present those options to a committee of executives who decide which one to go with. That takes a lot of time.","As a car lover, I ask myself, 'What am I going to be buying in the future? Will it be a boring, underpowered, dorky car because the government tells me I shouldn't pollute? Or do I come up with a cool-looking, sexy dream car that is also part of the future?'","I like to have the widest part of the car being the wheels and not the body. It gives it a more athletic look and, with the sculpture, helps make a car look sexy.","When I see a car I've designed going down the street and somebody admiring it, that's a nice feeling.","I probably have a very controversial view on autonomous driving versus anybody else in the auto industry. I don't believe that it makes any sense for an automaker to develop autonomous driving.","I'm kind of impatient. I like to see things realized and not just work on a project for three years and wait, wait, wait. I try to keep myself busy.","I don't take on projects that are a hassle or when someone comes in and says, 'We really need this design,' and I'm like, 'OK, fine, I'll do it.' It really has to be something that I personally feel intrigued and excited about - any product, as long as I'm excited by it. It doesn't have to be a car.","In a startup car company, everything you do has to be done in a different way than a traditional car company. And the main reason is that all of these big car companies are operating like giant well-oiled machines - you could put a very seasoned executive in, and all he has to do is make sure the machine keeps running.","The market needs a super car with no excuses.","I believe there is room in the market for a daily driver that embodies all the attributes of the best track racing car and the comfort of a luxurious sports car.","When I design a car, I want people to look at it and go, 'Wow, that's kind of interesting,' and do a second take."],"Henrik Ibsen":["A forest bird never wants a cage.","A thousand words will not leave so deep an impression as one deed.","A community is like a ship; everyone ought to be prepared to take the helm.","The spectacles of experience; through them you will see clearly a second time.","The strongest man in the world is he who stands most alone.","The majority is always wrong; the minority is rarely right.","It is inexcusable for scientists to torture animals; let them make their experiments on journalists and politicians.","The worst enemy of truth and freedom in our society is the compact majority.","The pillars of truth and the pillars of freedom - they are the pillars of society.","Your home is regarded as a model home, your life as a model life. But all this splendor, and you along with it... it's just as though it were built upon a shifting quagmire. A moment may come, a word can be spoken, and both you and all this splendor will collapse.","Do you know what we are those of us who count as pillars of society? We are society's tools, neither more nor less.","Castles in the air - they are so easy to take refuge in. And so easy to build too.","Never wear your best trousers when you go out to fight for freedom and truth.","Don't use that foreign word 'ideals.' We have that excellent native word 'lies.'","Really to sin you have to be serious about it.","The spirit of truth and the spirit of freedom - these are the pillars of society.","People who don't know how to keep themselves healthy ought to have the decency to get themselves buried, and not waste time about it.","I'm afraid for all those who'll have the bread snatched from their mouths by these machines. What business has science and capitalism got, bringing all these new inventions into the works, before society has produced a generation educated up to using them!","A minority may be right, and a majority is always wrong.","Marriage! Nothing else demands so much of a man.","These heroes of finance are like beads on a string; when one slips off, all the rest follow.","Home life ceases to be free and beautiful as soon as it is founded on borrowing and debt.","The devil is compromise.","Look into any man's heart you please, and you will always find, in every one, at least one black spot which he has to keep concealed.","One of the qualities of liberty is that, as long as it is being striven after, it goes on expanding. Therefore, the man who stands in the midst of the struggle and says, 'I have it,' merely shows by doing so that he has just lost it.","Do not use that foreign word 'ideals.' We have that excellent native word 'lies.'","The man whom God wills to slay in the struggle of life - he first individualizes.","What business has science and capitalism got, bringing all these new inventions into the works, before society has produced a generation educated up to using them!"],"Henrik Lundqvist":["We are all built differently. Some guys are more powerful. Some guys are very tall. I'm not very tall, so I rely on quickness.","Sometimes it just feels like the only thing you do is play hockey and eat.","As a goalie, you must stay positive. And if you do make a mistake, well, those things happen when you play my position.","I always want to push myself as far as possible; I always want to be up there and recognised as a good goalie and have people appreciate what you do.","When I grew up, I always ate Frosties Kelloggs.","For me, what takes up most of the space in my closet are suits. I wear a lot of suits and jackets. But I think every man needs a black suit at home. You can never go wrong in a black suit. But in terms of style, I think it's about being comfortable in what you wear.","During the Olympics they're really strict about what you're allowed to wear. You get a lot of clothes, but everything is pre-ordered. We had a fitting over the summer. You're not allowed to wear your own clothes. No logos, nothing. You get fined if you wear something you're not supposed to wear.","I love that about New York: You just dress the way you want to dress and feel really comfortable because nobody is judging. You can just be yourself, and it's perfectly normal.","Last time I was starstruck was when I met Roger Federer. He is one of the few athletes that I really look up to - incredibly talented both on and off the track and a great role model for tennis.","I've always aligned myself with a more modern, European fit. I maintain that fit is the thing that makes or breaks an outfit. Good tailoring trumps designer and price any day.","I don't shop by brand loyalty at all. I'm just drawn to what I like when I shop. I do like this brand called Tiger of Sweden a lot, though. They make great sportswear and tailoring. And Calvin Klein; big supporter of them as well.","I usually have a hard time with the fit of off-the-rack suits, thanks to my athletic proportions, but somehow Burberry always fits me perfectly. There's no tailoring really required, which is rare for me.","I love all the different ways that New Yorkers show their individuality through what they choose to wear.","The key for hipsters is that they usually try really hard, but the important thing is they want to come across like they don't try. To make it look effortless. I don't mind. It really fits New York, the hipster look.","It really comes down to fit. When it comes to a suit, for example, it's important that the shoulders fit you well; the length of the pants are important. That kind of shows me right away if you're into it or if you don't care. If they get the shoulders right, you know that they have some sort of interest in getting a good look.","I think Jennifer Lawrence seems to really get it right when she's on the red carpet.","My first idol was a Swedish goalie, Peter Lindmark.","I like to play music; play guitar - I love that. Play some golf in the summer. Just relax, enjoy the summer. That's nice.","I listen to all kinds of music. The Calling, Blink 182, Bruce Springsteen, I mean, it's everything.","Just because they're going to the gym, a lot of guys wear old T-shirts that look like they've been lying in the closet for 15 years. My workout clothes have to work.","When I try to relax, it's more Swedish rock, softer music, and I go out and do fun stuff. I play guitar, but it doesn't matter really what it is - just something that keeps you away from hockey.","There was a time in my life when I tried a lot of different things, different looks. Between the ages of 17 and 22, there were a lot of bad looks. But I guess you learn from your mistakes. After that, I kind of found my style and what I like to wear.","I love playing music, so I think the whole John Varvatos look is kind of cool. I think he has a great style.","You get to the rink, stretch for 10-15 minutes, go on the ice 20 minutes before practice starts and do goalie drills, practice for an hour, then stay on the ice for about 10-15 minutes to do extra shooting."],"Henrik Pontoppidan":["One of the middle ones in the flock, I was born on July 24, 1857, in the small Jutland town of Fredericia. In 1863, my father was transferred to Randers, another Jutland town, where a year later, at the age of six, I experienced the invasion of the allied Prussian and Austrian armies.","My father, Dines Pontoppidan, belonged to an old family of clergymen and was himself a minister.","After a summer trip to Switzerland, which was rich in experiences, I started writing. In the beginning, I aimed at descriptions of nature and folk life until, as the years passed, the description of man became my chief interest.","I turned to the novel, an artistic form which had in former days been neglected and had thus acquired a bad reputation, but which during the nineteenth century had developed and elevated itself to the ranks occupied by drama and the ancient epic."],"Henrikh Mkhitaryan":["Manchester United are not just any football club.","Manchester United are not just some club. To be part of this club also means to be part of a great history.","I am very proud to join Manchester United. This move is a dream come true for me.","Everything comes from your mind. You have to push yourself to get things going in your direction. If you are stubborn, nothing will help. If you are sad, nothing will help. You have to keep positive and to work very well for your next chance.","When your dreams are close to coming true, it does not feel real at first.","You cannot always have good times in your life.","I will not retreat; I will find the strength to reach my goal.","I never give up when I encounter obstacles in my way. I just continue going until I reach my career objectives.","I can be very serious, but if I'm being honest, I'm very happy with the way my life has turned out.","Even when I wasn't playing, I always had a smile on my face because if I acted sad or mad, it wouldn't help me.","I want to do everything to get to a new level.","As a footballer, you just have to try to learn what you've done bad and what I could do good.","For Manchest United, every cup is very important. A trophy is a trophy.","My father played five years for Valence in France's second division. I'd always cry when he would leave for training. Every morning, I'd say, 'Dad, take me with you. Please, please take me with you!'","By the time I was 10 years old, my entire life was football. Training, reading, watching, even playing football on PlayStation. I was totally focused on it. I especially loved the creative players - the maestros.","It was definitely not the salary that made me join Manchester United; I went for football reasons - for the history of the club, the league, the fans, and the coach because he is one of the best in the world.","I think the first goal can be weight off your shoulders.","I never promise something; I always say that I will try. Because if you promise something and you don't do it, you will always be under pressure.","You have to try and do everything to show your best qualities; otherwise, you will not be here anymore.","English football is really different to football in other countries.","As tough as it was for us with my father gone, my mother and sister were always pushing me. They even let me go to Brazil by myself when I was 13 to train with Sao Paulo for four months.","I dreamed of being like Kaka, and Brazil was the home of that creative style, which the Brazilians call ginga.","The Brazilians are amazing in their nature. You cannot describe it; you must feel that warmth when you're around them to understand.","When I returned to Armenia after four months in Brazil, I was still quite skinny and weak, but I had technique and skill.","I went a long way to play in Manchester United, so nothing will prevent me from achieving my dream.","My time with my father would be very meaningful, but also very short.","When I was six years old, my parents told me that we were moving back home to Armenia. I didn't really understand what was happening. My father had stopped playing football, and he was at home all the time.","I didn't know it, but my father had a brain tumour. Everything happened very fast. Within a year, he was gone. Because I was so young, I didn't completely understand the concept of death.","The year after my father died, I started football training. He was the drive for me; he was my idol. I said to myself, 'I have to run just like him. I have to shoot just like him.'","You have to win every battle. Every small metre counts, and you have to win your duels. Then you will see you will win the game.","It doesn't matter if they buy me for, I don't know, £38 million or £40m - I am not guaranteed to play the games.","I went a long way to play for Manchester United, so nothing will prevent me from achieving my dream.","Different managers give confidence in different ways. Some by hugging, others by talking or having conversations.","Brazil was a very good experience. I learned a lot about how to play football, both technical and physical. There would be a hundred kids of all ages, training and doing classes together.","It is not only about being technically good, it is all about giving your heart for the club, giving your best.","I know I can succeed at Manchester United, and I want to show everyone that I deserve to be a key player in this team and this league.","There are no disappointments, just challenges.","Regarding Jose Mourinho, I hope I can learn a lot from him - he is a coach with a fantastic record.","It is very difficult when you grow up without a father because you don't have a man who can give you direction and discipline.","In my case, my mother had to be my mother and father, so I am thankful to her.","I believe playing for such a great club like United honours my father's memory, and the inspiration and drive he gave to me when I was young. I hope he is proud looking at me from the sky.","You know that if you play football, you have to try to do the maximum, so I'm always doing the maximum for myself because when I retire from football, I want to sit down and think I did something good - I won this title, and I won this title. People will talk about what you have won, and that is the most important thing in football.","It doesn't matter if it is the League Cup, the FA Cup, or the Europa League. We want to do our best to try and win them all.","When I watched the Premier League on the telly, I didn't expect it to be that hard. The opponents are all physically strong, real athletes. It wasn't like that in Germany. You must be prepared for it. But I prepared myself for it.","I don't want to miss anything. Life's too short to pass on something.","It's not called the Theatre of Dreams for nothing.","In the '80s, before I was born, my dad played in the old Soviet Top League in our home country of Armenia. He was a small but very quick striker. 'Soviet Soldier' magazine actually honoured him with its 'Knight of Attack' award in 1984.","In 1989, when I was just a baby, we moved to France because of some conflicts that were brewing in Armenia.","It would be fair to say that the start of my life in Manchester was not perfect, but there have been many other times when I've had setbacks, and I have never given up.","When you walk onto the pitch at Old Trafford, it is not just a pitch, it is a stage. If my father could see me on that stage, I think he would be very proud. I was always kind of chasing him, and I think even though he's not here, he helped me to get to this place.","I've learned a lot from my mistakes.","Tactics are just a part of football because the players are playing.","Everything is up to the players and not the tactics. They're just small details that can show you the way to play.","It's always important to read, to know something about this world, so I try to learn, to know, to see what I can learn for myself. Be it from books, TV or the Internet, I try to know what happened in the world.","The most important competition is always the next match.","I had three very successful years in Germany with Borussia Dortmund, but I had the opportunity to move to one of the biggest clubs in the highest-profile league in the world.","I was always taught by my father to challenge myself and to continue to evolve in my career, and I saw the move to Manchester United as an opportunity to grow as a player and as a person.","There is not much sun, but I didn't move to Manchester to go to the beach.","I like to win the difficulties, because when you win the difficulties, it makes you stronger, so I'm trying to do everything to come up to a new level.","I like to play attacking, like a winger, or an attacking midfielder, so it depends on the coach, where he's looking at me for which position.","If you play football, you have to try to do the maximum, so I'm always doing the maximum for myself because, after my football career, I want to sit down and think I did something good.","I always wanted to become a football player, and I thank my parents, as they helped me so much to realise this dream. They always supported me on my path.","Not so many Armenian players are given the chance to play in the Champions League, and this is really important for me, because I want to do everything to impress the children who are watching me playing.","Every person has to keep in mind that they can grow up and reach the top, no matter where they are born, whether it's in Russia, in Ukraine, in Europe; they've still got the opportunity to show their talent and the culture of their people.","I am very excited - it's a big opportunity for me to play for Manchester United, a new challenge for me. I will try to do my best.","I really enjoy my life in Manchester, my training, my games, everything.","Coming to Manchester, maybe I didn't show all my potential, but in every game, I'm trying to do my best because it's very important for me, the fans, and the club. Maybe in some games it doesn't work, but I still keep working and trying to improve.","I did not want to later look back in my life and say, 'Why would you not make times change?'","I read about the history of England, of Manchester. I wanted to know how people here live, their interests.","When I came first to Dortmund, Jurgen Klopp said, 'Listen, Mkhitaryan, it's your family name - it's too long. So Henrikh, it's too long. Let's call you Micki. Are you okay?' I said, 'Okay, no problem.' And since that day, they started calling me Micki.","Do not think about records, because one day, they will break.","I play football like chess. You have to think a lot and anticipate what could happen after you make your move.","If you make a mistake, your opponent can punish, and you end up losing the game.","The most dangerous area is the centre, which has to be either attacked or defended in football, and it's the same in chess.","Everyone is at their best against the champions.","It's not easy when you have a new manager because you have to try and adapt yourself to him, the team, training sessions, and the game.","It's another pleasure to score at Old Trafford, so I will try to do me best to do that.","I remember once Manchester United were ahead of Manchester City by eight points and ended up losing it, so everything is possible in this life.","It's always a pity to lose or draw at the end of the game; it's always painful.","When we're leading during the game, we have to squeeze the opponent.","You can lose to any team and then beat your top opponents and still not be in the top four.","I think the most important thing is to play to help the team, winning the games - that is the main thing for me.","I keep working hard, and this will pay off.","I'm trying to do everything with my family members, my friends, who are watching me every day, every game I am playing, so they are trying to help me to say what I did wrong and what I did well, and I try to improve myself.","I don't think I will play every game, depending on the tactical situation, depending on the opponent, but I will do everything to try and help the team."],"Henrique Capriles Radonski":["Today, the future of Venezuela won and, as we said, we repeat to everyone: there is a path, there is a path for progress, for the future, to make Venezuela a greater country.","I'm like a ship captain: I have a woman in every port.","Judge for yourself who's still fighting for change and who got sick on power, because the person in the Miraflores has forgotten about the people of Venezuela.","I have never lost an election yet. I am a winner. Let's just say that.","Venezuelans are tired of 14 years of promises and no results. The only things growing are inflation, murder and crime. The good indicators - production, education and jobs - are all falling.","I aspire to be the president of all Venezuelans. The message is clear. Venezuelans are fed up with confrontation, with division.","There will be a winner. There will a president-elect. But there will not be a defeated people. Tomorrow, we are only one country, only one Venezuela. Tomorrow in the country there are many problems that we have to resolve. Problems do not wait.","They say that if I win that I'll take away benefits, but the only one who has expropriated things from you is this government. After visiting all around our Venezuela, I don't have a doubt that we will win.","The foreign policy of this government is driven by politics - to extend a revolution worldwide. My objective with regards to foreign relations is to benefit all Venezuelans.","How have relations with Iran and Belarus benefited Venezuela? We are interested in countries that have democracies, that respect human rights, that we have an affinity with. What affinity do we have with Iran?","Venezuelans have a deep democratic conviction. If the government hotheads ventured out to stir violence they would encounter the armed forces. I don't believe the armed forces respond to a political party.","The best university is the university of life.","When you're in prison, you either embrace religion or you reject it. I embraced it; it was a very spiritual time for me.","I think 40 is a good age to run a country. But I've always been fast.","This is what happened to me when I received the governorship. The corrupt previous governor didn't do the handover. We received the Miranda governorship completely dismantled."],"Henry A. Wallace":["A fascist is one whose lust for money or power is combined with such an intensity of intolerance toward those of other races, parties, classes, religions, cultures, regions or nations as to make him ruthless in his use of deceit or violence to attain his ends.","The American fascists are most easily recognized by their deliberate perversion of truth and fact. Their newspapers and propaganda carefully cultivate every fissure of disunity, every crack in the common front against fascism.","With a fascist the problem is never how best to present the truth to the public but how best to use the news to deceive the public into giving the fascist and his group more money or more power.","The American fascist would prefer not to use violence. His method is to poison the channels of public information.","It may be shocking to some people in this country to realize that, without meaning to do so, they hold views in common with Hitler when they preach discrimination against other religious, racial or economic groups.","Their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that, using the power of the state and the power of the market simultaneously, they may keep the common man in eternal subjection.","If we put our trust in the common sense of common men and 'with malice toward none and charity for all' go forward on the great adventure of making political, economic and social democracy a practical reality, we shall not fail.","What we must understand is that the industries, processes, and inventions created by modern science can be used either to subjugate or liberate. The choice is up to us.","Fascism is a worldwide disease. Its greatest threat to the United States will come after the war, either via Latin America or within the United States itself.","A liberal knows that the only certainty in this life is change but believes that the change can be directed toward a constructive end.","It is no coincidence that the growth of modern tyrants has in every case been heralded by the growth of prejudice.","We must not tolerate oppressive government or industrial oligarchy in the form of monopolies and cartels.","In an effort to eliminate the possibility of any rival growing up, some monopolists would sacrifice democracy itself.","This dullness of vision regarding the importance of the general welfare to the individual is the measure of the failure of our schools and churches to teach the spiritual significance of genuine democracy.","The obvious types of American fascists are dealt with on the air and in the press. These demagogues and stooges are fronts for others. Dangerous as these people may be, they are not so significant as thousands of other people who have never been mentioned.","The dangerous American fascist is the man who wants to do in the United States in an American way what Hitler did in Germany in a Prussian way.","The myth of fascist efficiency has deluded many people.","The symptoms of fascist thinking are colored by environment and adapted to immediate circumstances. But always and everywhere they can be identified by their appeal to prejudice and by the desire to play upon the fears and vanities of different groups in order to gain power.","The worldwide, agelong struggle between fascism and democracy will not stop when the fighting ends in Germany and Japan.","They are patriotic in time of war because it is to their interest to be so, but in time of peace they follow power and the dollar wherever they may lead.","Until democracy in effective enthusiastic action fills the vacuum created by the power of modern inventions, we may expect the fascists to increase in power after the war both in the United States and in the world.","If we define an American fascist as one who in case of conflict puts money and power ahead of human beings, then there are undoubtedly several million fascists in the United States.","If this liberal potential is properly channeled, we may expect the area of freedom of the United States to increase. The problem is to spend up our rate of social invention in the service of the welfare of all the people.","It has been claimed at times that our modern age of technology facilitates dictatorship.","Monopolists who fear competition and who distrust democracy because it stands for equal opportunity would like to secure their position against small and energetic enterprise.","Most American fascists are enthusiastically supporting the war effort. They are doing this even in those cases where they hope to have profitable connections with German chemical firms after the war ends.","Our chemical and other manufacturing concerns are all too often ready to let the Germans have Latin American markets, provided the American companies can work out an arrangement which will enable them to charge high prices to the consumer inside the United States.","The European brand of fascism will probably present its most serious postwar threat to us via Latin America.","The fascists in most Latin American countries tell the people that the reason their wages will not buy as much in the way of goods is because of Yankee imperialism. The fascists in Latin America learn to speak and act like natives.","The moral and spiritual aspects of both personal and international relationships have a practical bearing which so-called practical men deny.","There are probably several hundred thousand if we narrow the definition to include only those who in their search for money and power are ruthless and deceitful."],"Henry A.

One can trust nobody and nothing.","The woman who is known only through a man is known wrong.","No man should be in politics unless he would honestly rather not be there.","Nothing in education is so astonishing as the amount of ignorance it accumulates in the form of inert facts.","Politics, as a practise, whatever its professions, has always been the systematic organization of hatreds.","No man likes to have his intelligence or good faith questioned, especially if he has doubts about it himself.","American society is a sort of flat, fresh-water pond which absorbs silently, without reaction, anything which is thrown into it.","Practical politics consists in ignoring facts.","Man is an imperceptible atom always trying to become one with God.","The Indian Summer of life should be a little sunny and a little sad, like the season, and infinite in wealth and depth of tone, but never hustled.","Only on the edge of the grave can man conclude anything.","The effect of power and publicity on all men is the aggravation of self, a sort of tumor that ends by killing the victim's sympathies.","Thank God, I never was cheerful. I come from the happy stock of the Mathers, who, as you remember, passed sweet mornings reflecting on the goodness of God and the damnation of infants.","Politics... have always been the systematic organization of hatreds.","No man, however strong, can serve ten years as schoolmaster, priest, or Senator, and remain fit for anything else.","Politics are a very unsatisfactory game.","The progress of evolution from President Washington to President Grant was alone evidence to upset Darwin.","It is always good men who do the most harm in the world.","There is no such thing as an underestimate of average intelligence.","Accident counts for as much in companionship as in marriage.","They know enough who know how to learn.","Absolute liberty is absence of restraint; responsibility is restraint; therefore, the ideally free individual is responsible to himself.","It is impossible to underrate human intelligence - beginning with one's own.","Everyone carries his own inch rule of taste, and amuses himself by applying it, triumphantly, wherever he travels.","Morality is a private and costly luxury.","I have written too much history to have faith in it; and if anyone thinks I'm wrong, I am inclined to agree with him.","No one means all he says, and yet very few say all they mean, for words are slippery and thought is viscous.","At best, the renewal of broken relations is a nervous matter.","Intimates are predestined.","Power when wielded by abnormal energy is the most serious of facts.","Susceptibility to the highest forces is the highest genius.","The American President resembles the commander of a ship at sea. He must have a helm to grasp, a course to steer, a port to seek.","The difference is slight, to the influence of an author, whether he is read by five hundred readers, or by five hundred thousand; if he can select the five hundred, he reaches the five hundred thousand.","We combat obstacles in order to get repose, and when got, the repose is insupportable.","I am an anarchist in politics and an impressionist in art as well as a symbolist in literature.

It is the theme of much television programming across the world. It sells newspapers. Whenever we meet anyone, our first, almost unconscious reaction may be to look for imperfections.","It is never too late to strengthen the foundation of faith. There is always time. With faith in the Savior, you can repent and plead for forgiveness. There is someone you can forgive. There is someone you can thank. There is someone you can serve and lift. You can do it wherever you are and however alone and deserted you may feel.","For each of us, life is a journey. Heavenly Father designed it for us out of love. Each of us has unique experiences and characteristics, but our journey began in the same place before we were born into this world.","Our Heavenly Father knows us and our circumstances and even what faces us in the future. His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, our Savior, has suffered and paid for our sins and those of all the people we will ever meet. He has perfect understanding of the feelings, the suffering, the trials, and the needs of every individual.","We never need to feel that we are alone or unloved in the Lord's service because we never are. We can feel the love of God. The Savior has promised angels on our left and our right to bear us up. And He always keeps His word.","The words of confirmation into the Church are an invitation: 'Receive the Holy Ghost.' And that choice must be made not once, but every day, every hour, every minute.","Our Heavenly Father loves us. He sent His Only Begotten Son to be our Savior. He knew that in mortality we would be in grave danger, the worst of it from the temptations of a terrible adversary. That is one of the reasons why the Savior has provided priesthood keys so that those with ears to hear and faith to obey could go to places of safety.","Life eternal is to live in unity, in families, with the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Eternal life is only possible through the keys of the priesthood of God, which were restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Holding that eternal goal before the youth you lead is as great a gift as you could give them.","You make choices every day and almost every hour that keep you walking in the light or moving away toward darkness.","We are spirit children of a loving Heavenly Father who placed us in mortality to see if we would choose - freely choose - to keep His commandments and come unto His Beloved Son. They do not compel us. They cannot, for that would interfere with the plan of happiness. And so there is in us a God-given desire to be responsible for our own choices.","If we continue to seek learning to serve God and His children better, it is a blessing of great worth. If we begin to seek learning to exalt ourselves alone, it leads to selfishness and pride, which will take us away from eternal life.","When I am in situations where I break out of the pattern, it's hard on me. Once you get used to regular scripture study, you miss it if you don't have it. It's like food - you have to have it. I know that I need the scriptures like I need food. I don't miss a regular meal, and I don't miss regular scripture study.","Each life is unique. But for all, repentance will surely include passing through the portal of humble prayer. Our Father in Heaven can allow us to feel fully the conviction of our sins. He knows the depths of our remorse. He can then direct what we must do to qualify for forgiveness.","God the Father lives. He hears and answers our prayers in love. The Savior Jesus Christ, resurrected and glorious, lives and reaches out to us in mercy.","Parents, brothers and sisters, grandparents, aunts and uncles are made more powerful guides and rescuers by the bonds of love that are the very nature of a family.","We were promised that we would have Jehovah, Jesus Christ, as our Savior and Redeemer. He would assure that we would all be resurrected. And He would make it possible for us to pass the test of life if we exercised faith in Him by being obedient.","To find gratitude and generosity when you could reasonably find hurt and resentment will surprise you. It will be so surprising because you will see so much of the opposite: people who have much more than others yet who react with anger when one advantage is lost or with resentment when an added gift is denied.","The purpose of God's creations and of His giving us life is to allow us to have the learning experience necessary for us to come back to Him, to live with Him in eternal life.","Those who are faithful to God are protected and prospered. That comes as the result of serving God and keeping His commandments. But with those blessings comes the temptation to forget their source. It is easy to begin to feel the blessings were granted not by a loving God on whom we depend but by our own powers.","With the help of the Holy Ghost, we can watch over ourselves. We can pray to recognize and reject the first thoughts of sin. We can pray to recognize a warning not to speak words which would hurt or tempt someone else. And we can, when we must, pray for the humility and the faith to repent.","Children are to be born into a family where the parents hold the needs of children equal to their own in importance. And children are to love parents and each other.","The feeling of longing for home is born into us. That wonderful dream cannot become real without great faith - enough for the Holy Ghost to lead us to repentance, baptism, and the making and keeping of sacred covenants with God. This faith requires enduring bravely the trials of mortal life.","Our human tendency is to be impatient with the person who cannot see the truth that is so plain to us. We must be careful that our impatience is not interpreted as condemnation or rejection.","God offers us counsel not just for our own safety, but for the safety of His other children, whom we should love. There are few comforts so sweet as to know that we have been an instrument in the hands of God in leading someone else to safety. That blessing generally requires the faith to follow counsel when it is hard to do.","In the priesthood we share the sacred duty to labor for the souls of men. We must do more than learn that this is our duty. It must go down into our hearts so deeply that neither the many demands on our efforts in the bloom of life nor the trials that come with age can turn us from that purpose.","If we look for human frailty in humans, we will always find it. When we focus on finding the frailties of those who hold priesthood keys, we run risks for ourselves. When we speak or write to others of such frailties, we put them at risk.","The Savior will let you feel the love He feels for those you serve. The call is an invitation to become like Him.","We are the spirit children of a Heavenly Father. He loved us and He taught us before we were born into this world. He told us that He wished to give us all that He had. To qualify for that gift we had to receive mortal bodies and be tested. Because of those mortal bodies, we would face pain, sickness, and death.","When the words of prophets seem repetitive, that should rivet our attention.","God's purpose in creation was to let us prove ourselves. The plan was explained to us in the spirit world before we were born. We were valiant enough there to qualify for the opportunity to choose against temptation here to prepare for eternal life, the greatest of all the gifts of God.","With faith and obedience practiced long enough, the Holy Ghost becomes a constant companion, our natures change, and endurance becomes certain.","We are to learn our duty from the Lord, and then we are to act in all diligence, never being lazy or slothful. The pattern is simple but not easy to follow. We are so easily distracted.","The great test of life is to see whether we will hearken to and obey God's commands in the midst of the storms of life. It is not to endure storms, but to choose the right while they rage.","Each of you is a unique child of God. God knows you individually. He sends messages of encouragement, correction, and direction fitted to you and to your needs.","Those who submit like a child do it because they know that the Father wants only the happiness of His children and that only He knows the way. That is the testimony we must have to keep praying like a submissive child, in the good times as well as the times of trouble.","It is a lie that our anger justifies our impulse to hurt or ignore our antagonists. We are to forgive to be forgiven. To wait for them to repent before we forgive and repent is to allow them to choose for us a delay which could cost us happiness here and hereafter.","Discord or jealousy inhibits the ability of the Holy Ghost to teach us and inhibits our ability to receive light and truth. And the feelings of disappointment that invariably follow are the seeds of greater discord and faultfinding among those who expected a learning experience that did not come.","The miracle of unity is being granted to us as we pray and work for it in the Lord's way. Our hearts will be knit together in unity. God has promised that blessing to His faithful Saints whatever their differences in background and whatever conflict rages around them.","Every time in my life when I have chosen to delay following inspired counsel or decided that I was an exception, I came to know that I had put myself in harm's way. Every time that I have listened to the counsel of prophets, felt it confirmed in prayer, and then followed it, I have found that I moved toward safety.","Every child of Heavenly Father born in the world is given at birth, as a free gift, the Light of Christ.","You must have faith to pray. You must have faith to ponder the word of God. You must have faith to do those things and go to those places which invite the Spirit of Christ and the Holy Ghost.","The scriptures make the danger of delay clear. It is that we may discover that we have run out of time. The God who gives us each day as a treasure will require an accounting.","It takes a childlike heart to feel the promptings of the Spirit, to surrender to those commands, and to obey. That is what it takes to be nourished by the good word of God.","A little prosperity and peace, or even a turn slightly for the better, can bring us feelings of self-sufficiency. We can feel quickly that we are in control of our lives, that the change for the better is our own doing, not that of a God who communicates to us through the still, small voice of the Spirit.","Carrying a grudge is a heavy burden. As you forgive, you will feel the joy of being forgiven.","Our choosing the right consistently whenever the choice is placed before us creates the solid ground under our faith. It can begin in childhood, since every soul is born with the free gift of the Spirit of Christ. With that Spirit we can know when we have done what is right before God and when we have done wrong in His sight.","If we have faith in Jesus Christ, the hardest as well as the easiest times in life can be a blessing. In all conditions, we can choose the right with the guidance of the Spirit. We have the gospel of Jesus Christ to shape and guide our lives if we choose it.","You may feel overwhelmed by your own poverty and the labors of the day. But if you decide not to wait until you have more strength and more money, and if you pray for the Holy Spirit as you go, you will, when you arrive, know what to do and how to help someone even poorer than you are.","The best counsel for us to give young people is that they can arrive back to Heavenly Father only as they are guided and corrected by the Spirit of God. So if we are wise, we will encourage, praise, and exemplify everything which invites the companionship of the Holy Ghost.","Love is the motivating principle by which the Lord leads us along the way towards becoming like Him, our perfect example. Our way of life, hour by hour, must be filled with the love of God and love for others. There is no surprise in that, since the Lord proclaimed those as the first and great commandments.","Heavenly Father has assigned us to a great variety of stations to strengthen and, when needed, to lead travelers to safety. Our most important and powerful assignments are in the family. They are important because the family has the opportunity at the start of a child's life to put feet firmly on the path home.","The Lord protects, guides, and watches over those who are His trusted friends in His work. His work and that of His Father and our Father is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of the children of God. And Satan, the enemy of our happiness, opposes those who serve the Lord.","No one who strives with full faith and heart for the blessings of eternal life will be denied. And how great will be the joy and how much deeper the appreciation then after enduring in patience and faith now.","The pavilion that seems to intercept divine aid does not cover God but occasionally covers us. God is never hidden, yet sometimes we are, covered by a pavilion of motivations that draw us away from God and make Him seem distant and inaccessible.","God does not rule in nations, but He is mindful of them. He can and does place people in positions of influence who want what is best for the people and who trust in the Lord.","Out of love for His Father and for us, He allowed Himself to suffer beyond the capacity of mortal man. He told us some of what that infinite sacrifice required of Him.","Repentance, prayer, and pondering over the scriptures are essential parts of our qualifying for the gifts of the Spirit in our priesthood service. Further magnification of our power to serve will come as we respond with faith to go forward in our callings with the Holy Ghost to help us.","We treasure the word of God not only by reading the words of the scriptures, but by studying them. We may be nourished more by pondering a few words, allowing the Holy Ghost to make them treasures to us, than to pass quickly and superficially over whole chapters of scripture.","The words 'come unto Christ' are an invitation. It is the most important invitation you could ever offer to another person. It is the most important invitation anyone could accept.","The enemy of human happiness as well as the cause of poverty and starvation is not the birth of children. It is the failure of people to do with the earth what God could teach them to do if only they would ask and then obey, for they are agents unto themselves.","Let us do whatever is required to qualify for the Holy Ghost as our companion and then let us go forward fearlessly so that we will be given the powers to do whatever the Lord calls us to do.","Children are the inheritance of the Lord to us in this life and also in eternity. Eternal life is not only to have forever our descendants from this life. It is also to have eternal increase.","As a child of God, your destiny, if you work hard enough and are faithful, is to become like Him. That means that there is nothing that is true that you cannot learn, because He knows all truth.","When we struggle, as so many do, in grinding poverty, or when our enemies prevail against us, or when sickness is not healed, the enemy of our souls can send his evil message that there is no God or that if He exists He does not care about us.","I pray that wherever we are and whatever duties we have in the priesthood of God, we will be united in the cause to bring the gospel to all the world.","With aging comes physical and emotional challenge. We cannot seem to get as much done in an hour as we did in youth. And it is harder to be patient with others, and they seem more demanding.","Even the acceptance of personal responsibility may not overcome the temptation to believe that now is not the time to repent. 'Now' can seem so difficult, and 'later' appear so much easier. The truth is that today is always a better day to repent than any tomorrow.","Our feelings of separation from God will diminish as we become more childlike before Him. That is not easy in a world where the opinions of other human beings can have such an effect on our motives. But it will help us recognize this truth: God is close to us and aware of us and never hides from His faithful children.","Living as we do with a veil over our eyes, we cannot remember what it was like to be with our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, in the premortal world; nor can we see with our physical eyes or with reason alone the hand of God in our lives.","Heavenly Father has given a simple pattern for us to receive the Holy Ghost not once but continually in the tumult of our daily lives. The pattern is repeated in the sacramental prayer: We promise that we will always remember the Savior. We promise to take His name upon us. We promise to keep His commandments.","Hard as things seem today, they will be better in the next day if you choose to serve the Lord this day with your whole heart.","The message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is that we can and must expect to become better as long as we live.","The ideal God holds for us is to form families in the way most likely to lead to happiness and away from sorrow.","The sad pattern of lack of trust in God has persisted since the Creation.","Every missionary who is proclaiming the name and gospel of Jesus Christ will be blessed by daily feasting from the Book of Mormon.","Parents who struggle to get a witness of the Savior into the heart of a child will be helped as they seek for a way to bring the words and the spirit of the Book of Mormon into the home and all the lives in their family.","Foreseeing the needs of His children, a loving Heavenly Father placed directions and rescuers along their way. He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to make safe passage possible and visible.","We know the Lord makes His servants bold. The young boy Joseph who saw God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, in a grove of trees was transformed into a spiritual giant."],"Henry Beard":["You can often wash your troubles away with the right kind of bath. Throw everything you have into the tub: bubble gels, bubble oils, bubble powders, bubble gum.","There is no such thing as a 'correct' weight for any particular height - they are only averages.","Whenever I dream of playing a perfect round of golf, which I rarely do more than a dozen times a day, I picture myself on one of my favorite British Open-style links, and in particular the great courses of the west of Ireland, whose holes flow through naturally bunkered dunesland never far from the sight or sound of surf."],"Henry Bessemer":["I had an immense advantage over many others dealing with the problem inasmuch as I had no fixed ideas derived from long-established practice to control and bias my mind, and did not suffer from the general belief that whatever is, is right.","It is true I had been successful on a small scale in overcoming one of the main difficulties in the new process, but there was still much to invent, and much that at that period I necessarily knew nothing about.","On March 4th, 1830, I arrived in London, where a new world seemed opened to me.","We fixed on No. 4, Queen Street Place, for our City offices, and it was from there that so many of my patented inventions were dated.","I fear this little episode does not speak very favourably for my business capacity in those early days, for I certainly ought to have made much more than I did by this really important invention.","In such a case secrecy must be absolute to be effective, and although mere vague curiosity induced many persons of my intimate acquaintance to ask to be allowed to just go in and have a peep, I never admitted anyone.","At this period the enthusiasm of the amateur was fast giving way to a more steady commercial instinct, and I let no opportunity slip of improving my position, but I felt that I was still labouring under the disadvantage of not having acquired some technical profession.","I had now arrived at my seventeenth year, and had attained my full height, a fraction over six feet. I was well endowed with youthful energy, and was of an extremely sanguine temperament.","I was quite unable to make any white metal alloy hard enough to be made into powder by my machinery.","The bronze powder business, however, no longer required my personal attention, and was well managed by those I had chosen as the guardians of a secret, which was long and honourably kept."],"Henry Beston":["The three great elemental sounds in nature are the sound of rain, the sound of wind in a primeval wood, and the sound of outer ocean on a beach.","The seas are the heart's blood of the earth.","Learn to reverence night and to put away the vulgar fear of it, for, with the banishment of night from the experience of man, there vanishes as well a religious emotion, a poetic mood, which gives depth to the adventure of humanity.","Do no dishonour to the earth least you dishonour the spirit of man."],"Henry Bonilla":["You know, one of the perceptions, again, about FEMA is that there's been a demise in the organization since it became the - under - it started to become part of the Department of Homeland Security.","Part of the American dream is to own your own property - something no one can take from you.","I can recall back in 1998, in August of that year, when we had a horrible disaster along the Mexican border in the town of Del Rio. At the time, FEMA was the shining star of the federal government. It's now perceived as many to be the dullest knife in the drawer. Right or wrong, that's the perception.","The harshness and choice of words can cut deeply. Republicans need to show compassion and to be reasonable when talking to any ethnic group.","Governments should not be able to bulldoze a person's home or business to benefit other individuals.","We may not be able to control the Supreme Court... but we can control the money.","It's a wonderful city and every American has enjoyed New Orleans in one way or the other.","Most Hispanics are concerned with the same issues other Americans are - the economy, jobs, education. Similar to Main Street America.","Regardless of your political affiliation, most people agree that Ronald Reagan was an American icon. He was a president of national significance and for that reason he deserves an honor in the nation's capital.","President Bush offers the American people an optimistic vision and a clear choice in November. The President has provided steady leadership in remarkably changing times. He knows exactly where he wants to lead this country, and he has complete confidence in the American people.","In the next four years, President Bush will continue to keep America safe, our enemies on the run, and our economic progress moving forward. Texas is the home of our President, and we will make sure that is true for another four years.","Well, we have a crisis along the Mexican border right now, a state of emergency as declared by a bipartisan group of Texas House members just last fall. You know, we've had almost 200,000 OTMs - the government categorizes OT 'other, other than Mexicans' - along the Mexican border.","Well, I think when you come here and wave a Mexican flag in our face in a country that's giving a lot of these people an opportunity that they've never had before, I think a lot of Americans are insulted, whether they're first-, second-, third-, fourth- or fifth-generation Americans.","But again, to dealing with border security, is an issue that - it's like having a fire in the back of your house that you need to put out first before you talk about who, who you're going to let in the front door.","This issue of border security is not about, about ethnicity. I sit there on occasion with 10 or 12 sheriffs from my district, many of which are Democrats with last names like Reyes, with last names like Herrera and Lucio. And they are crying out for border security as well. So again, this is not an issue about being anti-Mexican.","It's difficult when you're an appointee of any administration to publicly come out and say before a crisis occurs to say that we need to do X, Y and Z to avoid a crisis, because you probably wouldn't be around very long if you did that."],"Henry Bromell":["I went to school with a guy named Truxton. He and I played football together, and he knocked me out once because he's bigger and strong than I am.","It's hard enough to tell good stories about people who analyze information for a living. It's even harder to do a good show about people who think for a living."],"Henry Brooke":["Tyranny Absolves all faith; and who invades our rights, However his own commence, can never be But an usurper.","A book may be compared to your neighbour: if it be good it cannot last too long; if bad, you cannot get rid of it too early."],"Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.":["It has been well said that a hungry man is more interested in four sandwiches than four freedoms.","May the United Nations ever be vigilant and potent to defeat the swallowing up of any nation, at any time, by any means-by armies with banners, by force or by fraud, by tricks or by midnight treachery.","This organization is created to prevent you from going to hell. It isn't created to take you to heaven.","The primary, the fundamental, the essential purpose of the United Nations is to keep peace. Everything it does which helps prevent World War III is good. Everything which does not further that goal, either directly or indirectly, is at best superfluous.","As you begin your tour of the United States, you may as well know that one American national trait which irritates many Americans and must be convenient for our critics is that we relentlessly advertise our imperfections.","The fact that the talk may be boring or turgid or uninspiring should not cause us to forget the fact that it is preferable to war.","Membership of the United Nations gives every member the right to make a fool of himself, and that is a right of which the Soviet Union in this case has taken full advantage."],"Henry Cabot Lodge":["Animosity is not a policy.","It sets its face rightfully against the doctrines of the Anarchist and the Communist, who seek to solve the social problems not by patient endeavor, but by brutal destruction.","Strong, generous, and confident, she has nobly served mankind. Beware how you trifle with your marvellous inheritance, this great land of ordered liberty, for if we stumble and fall freedom and civilization everywhere will go down in ruin.","New England has a harsh climate, a barren soil, a rough and stormy coast, and yet we love it, even with a love passing that of dwellers in more favored regions.","The United States is the world's best hope, but if you fetter her in the interests and quarrels of other nations, if you tangle her in the intrigues of Europe, you will destroy her power for good and endanger her very existence.","We would not have our politics distracted and embittered by the dissensions of other lands.","I would rather see the United States respected than loved by other nations.","The independence of the United States is not only more precious to ourselves but to the world than any single possession.","The time given to athletic contests and the injuries incurred on the playing field are part of the price which the English-speaking race has paid for being world conquerors.","Beware how you trifle with your marvelous inheritance, this great land of ordered liberty, for if we stumble and fall, freedom and civilization everywhere will go down in ruin.","Look at the United States today. We have made mistakes in the past. We have had shortcomings. We shall make mistakes in the future and fall short of our own best hopes.","But it is well to remember that we are dealing with nations every one of which has a direct individual interest to serve, and there is grave danger in an unshared idealism.","Contrast the United States with any country on the face of the earth today and ask yourself whether the situation of the United States is not the best to be found.","You may call me selfish if you will, conservative or reactionary, or use any other harsh adjective you see fit to apply, but an American I was born, an American I have remained all my life.","True Americanism recognizes the enormous gravity of the social and labor problems which confront us.","For we, too, have our ideals, even if we differ from those who have tried to establish a monopoly of idealism.","We should never suffer Cuba to pass from the hands of Spain to any other European power.","Standing, as I believe the United States stands for humanity and civilization, we should exercise every influence of our great country to put a stop to that war which is now raging in Cuba and give to that island once more peace, liberty, and independence.","I have loved but one flag and I can not share that devotion and give affection to the mongrel banner invented for the League of Nations.","Internationalism, illustrated by the Bolshevik and by the men to whom all countries are alike provided they can make money out of them, is to me repulsive.","Washington's entire honesty of mind and his fearless look into the face of all facts are qualities which can never go out of fashion and which we should all do well to imitate.","Are ideals confined to this deformed experiment upon a noble purpose, tainted, as it is, with bargains and tied to a peace treaty which might have been disposed of long ago to the great benefit of the world if it had not been compelled to carry this rider on its back?","Our ideal of the future is that she should continue to render that service of her own free will.","She has great problems of her own to solve, very grim and perilous problems, and a right solution, if we can attain to it, would largely benefit mankind.","We would not have our country's vigour exhausted or her moral force abated, by everlasting meddling and muddling in every quarrel, great and small, which afflicts the world.","Our ideal is to make her ever stronger and better and finer, because in that way alone, as we believe, can she be of the greatest service to the world's peace and to the welfare of mankind.","Lincoln did more than any other man to put the stamp of righteousness, to put the stamp of compassion, on the name of America.","True Americanism is opposed utterly to any political divisions resting on race and religion.","If a man is going to be an American at all let him be so without any qualifying adjectives, and if he is going to be something else, let him drop the word American from his personal description.","The Pilgrim and the Puritan whom we honor tonight were men who did a great deal of work in the world. They had their faults and their - shortcomings, but they were not slothful in business and they were most fervent in spirit.","I fear that the hearts of the vast majority of mankind would beat on strongly and steadily and without any quickening if the league were to perish altogether.","Whatever may be said as to our relations to some other countries, I think the relations of this country to Spain offer no ties of gratitude or of blood.","If that for which the Spanish Empire has stood since the days of Charles V is right, then everything for which the United States stands and has always stood is wrong.","Recognition of belligerency as an expression of sympathy is all very well."],"Henry Campbell-Bannerman":["In addressing you I feel that I am not so much speaking to the representatives of diverse States of Europe and America as to the exponents of principles and hopes that are common to us all, and without which our life on earth would be a life without horizon or prospect.","You have indeed done much since the new century began to give shape and substance to the growing, the insistent desire that war may be banished from the earth.","Gentlemen, I fervently trust that before long the principle of arbitration may win such confidence as to justify its extension to a wider field of international differences.","We have to admit that, notwithstanding all the efforts in which governments and peoples have participated, no corresponding change has been wrought in the aspect of the world's armaments.","But, gentlemen, can any of us say that as a result of such overwhelming sacrifices of money, of men, of ideals, and of civil dignity the sense of security has indeed been attained?","Scare answers to scare, and force begets force, until at length it comes to be seen that we are racing one against another after a phantom security which continually vanishes as we approach."],"Henry Cantwell Wallace":["To destroy a standing crop goes against the soundest instincts of human nature.","People in cities may forget the soil for as long as a hundred years, but Mother Nature's memory is long and she will not let them forget indefinitely."],"Henry Carter Stuart":["Oh no, I am descended from the important Carters.","I have never seen any good resulting from educating the Negro.","It was impossible to reason with a negro-that the only way to keep him in his place was to keep him under fear."],"Henry Cavill":["I never thought of myself as unlucky.

Every job could be your last.","As an outside; don't worry about failure, because failure will take care of itself. Focus on success.","I'm a giant softy, for sure, but I honestly think these days it's probably considered more masculine to be emotionally connected.","Not every job is a good job.","My mother works in a bank, and my dad is the head of my management team and also works in finance.","I will say I was a lot bigger as Superman. A lot bigger. I'm not saying how much. It's modesty about the weight - I've always been worried about my weight - but I also don't want to invite that debate: 'Henry weighs this, so he's the perfect Superman.' Or, 'Henry doesn't weigh this, and therefore he's not believable in the role.'","I'm from a family of six men, so I'm bound to be physical.","Regrets are something you can't really have as an actor, because ultimately you'll end up destroying yourself... there's a lot of disappointment in this business.","My mother is such an incredibly strong woman. She raised a family of five boys extremely well. She made us all strong, loving, caring people. We all support each other. I'm really thankful to her.","This character matters so much to so many people. I want to get that right. I want to do it justice. I want people to believe in the character and have faith in the character and kids to grow up wanting to be Superman. Or, God forbid, there's people who are going through hardship and wishing that this character would turn up and save them.","I didn't see a lot of comic books growing up.","People have this belief that actors are able to go out there and say, 'Oh I choose this job,' but most of the time we're just taking the job we can get. We don't just get offered thousands of jobs; we might earn one job a year and that's the one we'll take because we've got to pay the rent.","At boarding school there wasn't much time for much of anything except education.","The point of acting is to pretend you're someone else and sell a story.","I don't think Americans look bad in spandex.","I work out two, two and a half hours a day.","Some people thrive under pressure, but pressure can also ruin your performance, it can push you down angles which you don't want to go.","You can train and train until you are blue in the face, but you've got to diet, you've got to have that leanness because if you are not lean, your abs won't show. Of course, the training has to be put in, but then you've to shed all the fat and keep the fat off. And that's how you get an eight pack.","I suppose that when I'm building a character, it's usually related to what their family is like and who their parents are, as well as how I grew up - that nurture side.","As much as everyone says that Superman is good, a lot of other people might say that that's why they find him boring... A lot of Batman fans might say that.","Certainly, for younger guys, Superman is this mythological character that they've thought about and explored in their imaginations... But one thing I really like about Superman fans is that they're so open-minded and excited and honest. There's something beautiful about their enjoyment of it - something very Superman-like.","A lot of the stuff you do as an actor - or I do, because I can't speak for everyone - is not always consciously thought out. A lot of the time, for me, it's actually just feeling stuff, and it happens all in the moment and your body reacts.","I was overweight when I went to school. In fact, I was overweight when I left, just taller. Fatty Cavill was the nickname. I mean, no one wants to be Fatty Cavill.","There's an honesty to Clark, Kal-El - Kal-El's the better way of saying it because he is both Superman and Clark - there's an honesty to him which crosses over on both - I don't like to use the word 'identities,' but I will because I can't think of a better one. So, it is not that tough to make that swap and change.","I often find during a day of shooting I will speak in an American accent all day long when I'm doing dialogue. At the end of the day, it often takes an effort when I'm talking to my fiancee to bring my English back just because you're so used to speaking that way.","'Immortals' was very much a martial arts based training program - a lot of body weight stuff, very little in the way of actually lifting heavy weights, and a very, very low calorie diet.","A large amount of constant activity will get things going. For example, training in the morning will have everything, all the juices flowing by the time you actually get to work.

If you have a backup plan, then you've already admitted defeat.","I work out two, two and a half hours a day. For 'Immortals,' it was body-weight stuff: crunches, pullups, and martial arts-based cardio.","It's difficult to judge other actors, because as an actor you're looking at different things than what an audience is looking at."],"Henry Chadwick":["Base Ball, to be played thoroughly, requires the possession of muscular strength, great agility, quickness of eye, readiness of hand, and many other faculties of mind and body that mark the man of nerve.","It was not long before I was struck with the idea that base ball was just the game for a national sport for Americans.","Most Americans think Abner Doubleday invented the game but he had little or nothing to do with cricket.","The Nationals tried hard to recover the lost ground. The final result, however, was the success of the Forest Citys by a score of 29 to 23 in a nine innings game, twice interrupted by rain.","A Church which has lost its memory is in a sad state of senility."],"Henry Charles Carey":["By adopting the 'free trade,' or British, system, we place ourselves side by side with the men who have ruined Ireland and India, and are now poisoning and enslaving the Chinese people.","Wherever it is resisted, slaver dies away and freedom grows.","The system has for its object an increase of persons that are to intervene between the producer and the consumer, living on the product of the land and labour of others, diminishing the power of the first, and increasing the number of the last.","The whole action of the laws tended to increase the number of consumers of food and to diminish the number of producers, was due the invention of the Malthusian theory of population.","By adopting the other trade, we place ourselves by the side of those whose measures tend not only to the improvement of their own subjects, but to the emancipation of the slave everywhere.","The first of all commodities to be exchanged is labour, and the freedom of man consists only in the exercise of the right to determine for himself in what manner his labour shall be employed, and how he will dispose of its products.","It the British System is the most gigantic system of slavery the world has yet seen, and therefore it is that freedom gradually disappears from every country over which England is enabled to obtain control.","In this country protection has always, to some extent, existed; but at some times it has been efficient, and at others not; and our tendency toward freedom or slavery has always been in the direct ratio of its efficiency or inefficiency.","In the period from 1824 to 1833, the tendency was steadily in the former direction, but it was only in the latter part of it that it was made really efficient.","In 1833, protection was abandoned, and a tariff was established by which it was provided that we should, in a few years, have a system of merely revenue duties.","From that date the abandonment of the older State proceeded with a rapidity never before known, and with it grew the domestic slave trade and the pro-slavery feeling.","Then it was that were passed the laws restricting emancipation and prohibiting education.","Then it was that the exports of slaves from Virginia and the Carolinas was so great that the population of those States remained almost, if not quite stationary.","The natural consequence of our submission, even in part, to the system that looks to compelling the export of raw products, the exhaustion of the land, the cheapening of labour, and the export of the labourer.","It will be said, however, that protection tends to destroy commerce, the civilizer of mankind. Directly the reverse, however, is the fact.","The commerce of India does not grow, nor does that of Portugal, or of Turkey; that but that of the protected countries does increase, as has been shown in the case of Spain, and can now be shown in that of Germany.","As regards this country, in which protection has always to some extent existed, it is the best customer that England ever had, and our demands upon her grow most steadily and regularly under protection.","To enable men to exercise that power is the object of protection."],"Henry Cisneros":["Americans are a can-do people, an enthusiastic people, a problem-solving people. And when given a direction and given a plan, they'll sign on.","We can either allow our youth to shoot baskets or watch them continue to shoot people.","I don't think we have any time to waste.","As Secretary of Housing, I do have to express alarm, signal the alarm if you will, that the potential for homelessness to grow is there.","I was a little lacking in vision as mayor - I failed to understand the significance that housing and the revitalization of housing means for a city.","The hurricane complicates things in that what would have been purely a business decision becomes a decision of the heart.","The cancer doesn't bother me. I have great faith that the technology will beat it."],"Henry Clay":["Of all the properties which belong to honorable men, not one is so highly prized as that of character.","The Constitution of the United States was made not merely for the generation that then existed, but for posterity- unlimited, undefined, endless, perpetual posterity.","Courtesies of a small and trivial character are the ones which strike deepest in the grateful and appreciating heart.","Of all human powers operating on the affairs of mankind, none is greater than that of competition.","I would rather be right than President.","I have heard something said about allegiance to the South. I know no South, no North, no East, no West, to which I owe any allegiance.","An oppressed people are authorized whenever they can to rise and break their fetters.","Government is a trust, and the officers of the government are trustees. And both the trust and the trustees are created for the benefit of the people.","Statistics are no substitute for judgment.","If you wish to avoid foreign collision, you had better abandon the ocean."],"Henry Cloud":["If you are building a culture where honest expectations are communicated and peer accountability is the norm, then the group will address poor performance and attitudes.","Everything has seasons, and we have to be able to recognize when something's time has passed and be able to move into the next season. Everything that is alive requires pruning as well, which is a great metaphor for endings.","A culture is like an immune system. It operates through the laws of systems, just like a body. If a body has an infection, the immune system deals with it. Similarly, a group enforces its norms, either actively or passively.","Don't use all-or-nothing thinking. Take each day as its own day, and don't worry about it if you mess up one day. The most important thing you can do is just get back up on the horse.","In the end, as a leader, you are always going to get a combination of two things: what you create and what you allow.","As a psychologist, I can tell you that there are people who look very good in a group, but they're very different in a one-on-one situation.","In a very real way, ownership is the essence of leadership. When you are 'ridiculously in charge,' then you own whatever happens in a company, school, et cetera.","Part of executive functions is the ability to look to a goal deadline and assess where an organization is in meeting it.","The physicality of a real relationship - one that encompasses mind, body and soul - ultimately makes it more fulfilling and powerful than any virtual relationship ever could be.","Physical presence provides chemical, relational, psychological and physiological effects that virtual relationships cannot. Our brains change in the presence of another person and their behavior.","If you want to become healthy, you have to surround yourself with a group of people that are getting healthy, and you have to be connected to a community that is doing what you want to do.","We know from research that growth is actually contagious, so if you want to reach your goals, you've got to get around people that are going in the same direction you want to be going, and you will catch the success.","Leaders set a very clear path every day, in a thousand different ways, of what the people must attend to, inhibit, and keep it current in front of them.","In both our personal and professional lives, there are times when reality dictates that we must stand up and 'end' something. Either its time has passed, its season is over, or worse, continuing it would be destructive in some way.","Some goals are not going to fulfill you. Choose goals that you value and care about.","Closed systems run down and get more chaotic over time. Always get better by being 'open' to outside energy and templates of better ways to function.","I fell in love with the topic of leadership. For three decades, that has been a major focus of my hands-on work: listening to and working with leaders, their teams and their organizations.","People tend to look at dating sort of like a safari - like they're trying to land the trophy.","I think that God will provide opportunities and people and experiences, and everything we need to date and ultimately to find the one.","I do believe there are things that we desire that are not in the cards. But more often than not, when people have a desire for a relationship and it's not happening, there are probably issues to be resolved and issues people could work on that would ultimately end in that desire being fulfilled.","The power of being in the physical presence of another person delivers real benefits.","What happens with a lot of leaders is that their leadership style is like ADD; they are all over the place with different ideas. They could be driving one idea forward but then move on to something else too soon.","The best way to advance in a career is to get great results while working with people.","Every human being must have boundaries in order to have successful relationships or a successful performance in life.","Some people's developmental path has not equipped them to stand up and let go of something.","Endings are a part of life, and we are actually wired to execute them. But because of trauma, developmental failures, and other reasons, we shy away from the steps that could open up whole new worlds of development and growth."],"Henry Cotton":["Imagine the ball has little legs, and chop them off.","The big trick in putting is not method; the secret of putting is domination of the nerves.","Golf is a matter of confidence. If you think you cannot do it, there is no chance you will."],"Henry Cuellar":["My focus as part of the leadership is to keep talking about the independent voters, independent voters - how do we get the independent voters back?","And, as you recall, last year, people were asking us, don't vote on the bill until you read every part of the bill. So, as a good attorney and as a good legislator, I think it's my responsibility to read the amendments.","We can adhere to the Henry Hyde amendment by saying that no federal funds will be used for abortions. And that's the bottom line for me.","You know, I got the third most uninsured district in the whole state of Texas, probably number nine in the whole country. As a Blue Dog, I'm also looking at the cost. So, I have got a very unique district.","Well, look, let me put it this way. Back in 2005, when I was a freshman, I - I was the first Democrat to support CAFTA. My labor union folks made me their number-one target. They came after me, and I'm still here.","As I get close to my election, I want to spend more time in my district and focus on my reelection.","I have consistently made it very clear that I will vote a straight Democratic ticket, just like I do every election. From the local Constable to the President, I will be voting for every Democrat on the ballot.","If we want to boost border security, we have to help law enforcement agencies beef up their resources to meet this demand. We cannot have one without the other.","We intend to keep the lines of communication open with the Defense Department so we can help our border law enforcement agencies navigate the equipment application process."],"Henry Czerny":["I wasn't one of those people who went to see a play and said, 'I want to be an actor.' I fell into it.","My dad thought I'd end up in the poorhouse or in doughnut shops with a bag full of reviews.","The bad guys I play don't want to be bad.

It keeps me on my toes."],"Henry David Thoreau":["It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.","Time is but the stream I go a-fishing in.","An early-morning walk is a blessing for the whole day.","Many men go fishing all of their lives without knowing that it is not fish they are after.","Thank God men cannot fly, and lay waste the sky as well as the earth.","Pursue some path, however narrow and crooked, in which you can walk with love and reverence.","Friends... they cherish one another's hopes. They are kind to one another's dreams.","The language of friendship is not words but meanings.","True friendship can afford true knowledge. It does not depend on darkness and ignorance.","Not until we are lost do we begin to understand ourselves.","You must live in the present, launch yourself on every wave, find your eternity in each moment.","What lies behind us and what lies ahead of us are tiny matters compared to what lives within us.","This world is but a canvas to our imagination.","Wealth is the ability to fully experience life.","Nature will bear the closest inspection. She invites us to lay our eye level with her smallest leaf, and take an insect view of its plain.","If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.","I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.","If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.","It is not enough to be busy. So are the ants. The question is: What are we busy about?","The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it.","Live your life, do your work, then take your hat.","Every day or two, I strolled to the village to hear some of the gossip which is incessantly going on there, circulating either from mouth to mouth, or from newspaper to newspaper, and which, taken in homeopathic doses, was really as refreshing in its way as the rustle of leaves and the peeping of frogs.","Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it.","Goodness is the only investment that never fails.","Our life is frittered away by detail... simplify, simplify.","I would rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself, than be crowded on a velvet cushion.","It is better to have your head in the clouds, and know where you are... than to breathe the clearer atmosphere below them, and think that you are in paradise.","There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root.","The most I can do for my friend is simply be his friend.","Never look back unless you are planning to go that way.","I am grateful for what I am and have. My thanksgiving is perpetual.","In human intercourse the tragedy begins, not when there is misunderstanding about words, but when silence is not understood.","Could a greater miracle take place than for us to look through each other's eyes for an instant?","Live your beliefs and you can turn the world around.","Aim above morality. Be not simply good, be good for something.","Though I do not believe that a plant will spring up where no seed has been, I have great faith in a seed... Convince me that you have a seed there, and I am prepared to expect wonders.","Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth.","Make the most of your regrets; never smother your sorrow, but tend and cherish it till it comes to have a separate and integral interest. To regret deeply is to live afresh.","Things do not change; we change.","Heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads.","Truths and roses have thorns about them.","Disobedience is the true foundation of liberty. The obedient must be slaves.","There are moments when all anxiety and stated toil are becalmed in the infinite leisure and repose of nature.","If we will be quiet and ready enough, we shall find compensation in every disappointment.","Our truest life is when we are in dreams awake.","There is no value in life except what you choose to place upon it and no happiness in any place except what you bring to it yourself.","The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.

Severe truth is expressed with some bitterness.","It is a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things.","Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed, and in such desperate enterprises? If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer.","I had three chairs in my house; one for solitude, two for friendship, three for society.","Men have become the tools of their tools.","In the long run, men hit only what they aim at.

I am related to the earliest times, and to the latest.","We are all sculptors and painters, and our material is our own flesh and blood and bones. Any nobleness begins at once to refine a man's features, any meanness or sensuality to imbrute them.","If you can speak what you will never hear, if you can write what you will never read, you have done rare things.","The perception of beauty is a moral test.","If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them.","Any fool can make a rule, and any fool will mind it.","That government is best which governs least.","As if you could kill time without injuring eternity.","The heart is forever inexperienced.","We are always paid for our suspicion by finding what we suspect.","The universe is wider than our views of it.","As you simplify your life, the laws of the universe will be simpler; solitude will not be solitude, poverty will not be poverty, nor weakness weakness.","None are so old as those who have outlived enthusiasm.","After the first blush of sin comes its indifference.","Every generation laughs at the old fashions, but follows religiously the new.","To be admitted to Nature's hearth costs nothing. None is excluded, but excludes himself. You have only to push aside the curtain.","Nay, be a Columbus to whole new continents and worlds within you, opening new channels, not of trade, but of thought.","So thoroughly and sincerely are we compelled to live, reverencing our life, and denying the possibility of change.

Haste makes waste, no less in life than in housekeeping. Keep the time, observe the hours of the universe, not of the cars.","A man's interest in a single bluebird is worth more than a complete but dry list of the fauna and flora of a town.","We are for the most part more lonely when we go abroad among men than when we stay in our chambers. A man thinking or working is always alone, let him be where he will.","Under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a just man is also a prison.","I have found that no exertion of the legs can bring two minds much nearer to one another.","Our inventions are wont to be pretty toys, which distract our attention from serious things.

The one melts, the other breaks into pieces.","Read the best books first, or you may not have a chance to read them at all.","Books are to be distinguished by the grandeur of their topics even more than by the manner in which they are treated.","All men are children, and of one family. The same tale sends them all to bed, and wakes them in the morning.","A man is rich in proportion to the number of things he can afford to let alone.","A truly good book teaches me better than to read it. I must soon lay it down, and commence living on its hint. What I began by reading, I must finish by acting.","Do not be too moral. You may cheat yourself out of much life so.","Before printing was discovered, a century was equal to a thousand years.","The squirrel that you kill in jest, dies in earnest.","Every creature is better alive than dead, men and moose and pine trees, and he who understands it aright will rather preserve its life than destroy it.","The greatest compliment that was ever paid me was when one asked me what I thought, and attended to my answer.","Money is not required to buy one necessity of the soul.","Nature is full of genius, full of the divinity; so that not a snowflake escapes its fashioning hand.","I did not wish to take a cabin passage, but rather to go before the mast and on the deck of the world, for there I could best see the moonlight amid the mountains.

I answer, that he cannot without disgrace be associated with it.","Faith never makes a confession.","If I knew for a certainty that a man was coming to my house with the conscious design of doing me good, I should run for my life.","There are certain pursuits which, if not wholly poetic and true, do at least suggest a nobler and finer relation to nature than we know.

Old deeds for old people, and new deeds for new.","There is no odor so bad as that which arises from goodness tainted.","Alas! how little does the memory of these human inhabitants enhance the beauty of the landscape!","I have found that hollow, which even I had relied on for solid.","The man who is dissatisfied with himself, what can he do?","Do not hire a man who does your work for money, but him who does it for love of it.","How sweet is the perception of a new natural fact!","It appears to be a law that you cannot have a deep sympathy with both man and nature.","Justice is sweet and musical; but injustice is harsh and discordant.","I have seen how the foundations of the world are laid, and I have not the least doubt that it will stand a good while.","Shall I not have intelligence with the earth? Am I not partly leaves and vegetable mould myself.","Through our own recovered innocence we discern the innocence of our neighbors.","As for doing good; that is one of the professions which is full. Moreover I have tried it fairly and, strange as it may seem, am satisfied that it does not agree with my constitution.","'Tis healthy to be sick sometimes.","Books can only reveal us to ourselves, and as often as they do us this service we lay them aside.","I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartanlike as to put to rout all that was not life.","There is no more fatal blunderer than he who consumes the greater part of his life getting his living.","Not only must we be good, but we must also be good for something.","All this worldly wisdom was once the unamiable heresy of some wise man.","A man cannot be said to succeed in this life who does not satisfy one friend.","In my afternoon walk I would fain forget all my morning occupations and my obligations to society.","While civilization has been improving our houses, it has not equally improved the men who are to inhabit them. It has created palaces, but it was not so easy to create noblemen and kings.","Night is certainly more novel and less profane than day.","There is always a present and extant life, be it better or worse, which all combine to uphold.","Instead of noblemen, let us have noble villages of men.","Every people have gods to suit their circumstances.","It is remarkable how closely the history of the apple tree is connected with that of man.","Nature puts no question and answers none which we mortals ask.

Will it not rather be elevating as a ladder, the means by which we are translated?","Nature and human life are as various as our several constitutions. Who shall say what prospect life offers to another?","It is not part of a true culture to tame tigers, any more than it is to make sheep ferocious.","I think that there is nothing, not even crime, more opposed to poetry, to philosophy, ay, to life itself than this incessant business.","Only that day dawns to which we are awake.","Only he is successful in his business who makes that pursuit which affords him the highest pleasure sustain him.","It is usually the imagination that is wounded first, rather than the heart; it being much more sensitive.","It is the greatest of all advantages to enjoy no advantage at all.","As in geology, so in social institutions, we may discover the causes of all past changes in the present invariable order of society.","There are old heads in the world who cannot help me by their example or advice to live worthily and satisfactorily to myself; but I believe that it is in my power to elevate myself this very hour above the common level of my life.","There is no just and serene criticism as yet.","There is but one stage for the peasant and the actor.","There is more of good nature than of good sense at the bottom of most marriages.","Do what nobody else can do for you.

It allows of no tricks. The best you can write will be the best you are.","I say, beware of all enterprises that require new clothes, and not rather a new wearer of clothes.","It is an interesting question how far men would retain their relative rank if they were divested of their clothes.","We shall see but a little way if we require to understand what we see.","It is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law, so much as for the right.","What is human warfare but just this; an effort to make the laws of God and nature take sides with one party.","I have a great deal of company in the house, especially in the morning when nobody calls.","To a philosopher all news, as it is called, is gossip, and they who edit and read it are old women over their tea.","The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run.","How could youths better learn to live than by at once trying the experiment of living?","Being is the great explainer.","If I seem to boast more than is becoming, my excuse is that I brag for humanity rather than for myself.","We know but a few men, a great many coats and breeches.","To have done anything just for money is to have been truly idle.","Faith keeps many doubts in her pay.

For me, there has been no serious difficulty in reconciling the principles of true science with the principles of true religion.","The gospel may not make a sow's ear into a silk purse, but it will make everybody better if they live it. I've tried it. It stands the test.","Some people conclude that the injustices existing in the world prove there is no God. On the contrary, I conclude that God, being both just and merciful, will and can rectify all inequities in a life after death.","God will use us for his purposes, but it takes a certain kind of listening.","I believe that what is really important is that God can speak to us. If we have the humility to approach him in prayer with the right attitude, he can speak to our intelligence directly.","Death is not the end; it is but one more step in a great forward march made possible by the redemption wrought by the Savior. This is the spirit of true science - constant and eternal seeking.","The more I try to unravel the mysteries of the world in which we live, the more I come to the conception of a single overruling power - God.","I perceive myself as rather uninhibited, with a certain mathematical facility and more interest in the broad aspect of a problem than the delicate nuances. I am more interested in discovering what is over the next rise than in assiduously cultivating the beautiful garden close at hand.","I would write a scientific paper with the devil, if it was on high temperatures.

Jackson Pollock, abstract expressionism and painting were well known at this time.","I began composing works which were imitative of the music I was being told about. I was also very interested in translating the music into visual terms.","When I came to New York, I began to meet the people who became the most famous artists of our time. I was insecure about my own level of ability, I didn't know whether I could compete with these people and, at the same time. I was wondering what is this anyway?","In classical oil painting, there seemed to be a radical turn to seeing things as the camera sees them, with that technological modification. I began to have a tremendous problem with all of this.","At the same time, I was listening to black music, and I began to think that the best musicians were receiving the worst treatment. The people who were doing the greatest work were despised as lower class, with no dignity accorded to what they did.","Basically, I viewed any work of art as an imposition of another person's taste, and saw the individual making this imposition as a kind of dictator.","I began demonstrating against serious culture. In hindsight, the actual course of events has been very humiliating for me, because no one picked up on the intellectual critique I made.","Rock became an incredible commercial success, people just became bored with serious music, and it was forgotten.","Around 1967 I began backing away from dogmatic Leninism, not so much because I thought it was false, I just decided there was nothing utopian about it.","I have a picture of an ideal consciousness.","I'm actually a great fan of lucidity.","I'm trying to assemble materials for a different mode of life.","The whole drive of western culture, the part of it which is serious, is towards an extreme objectification.

Instead, policies concerning the defense budget, deregulation, health care, public transportation, job training programs, and a host of other crucial areas are now largely written by lobbyists who represent mega corporations.","As the humanities and liberal arts are downsized, privatized, and commodified, higher education finds itself caught in the paradox of claiming to invest in the future of young people while offering them few intellectual, civic, and moral supports.","We increasingly live in societies based on the vocabulary of 'choice' and a denial of reality - a denial of massive inequality, social disparities, the irresponsible concentration of power in relatively few hands, and a growing machinery of social and civil death.","Universities are some of the few places left where a struggle for the commons, for public life, if not democracy itself, can be made visible through the medium of collective voices and social movements energized by the need for a politics and way of life counter to authoritarian capitalism.","Universities should be about more than developing work skills. They must also be about producing civic-minded and critically engaged citizens - citizens who can engage in debate, dialogue and bear witness to a different and critical sense of remembering, agency, ethics and collective resistance.","Not only does neoliberalism undermine both civic education and public values and confuse education with training, it also treats knowledge as a product, promoting a neoliberal logic that views schools as malls, students as consumers, and faculty as entrepreneurs.","Getting ahead cannot be the only motive that motivates people. You have to imagine what a good life is.","The mainstream media spins stories that are largely racist, violent, and irresponsible - stories that celebrate power and demonize victims, all the while camouflaging its pedagogical influence under the cheap veneer of entertainment.","Collective freedom provides the basic conditions for people to narrate their own lives, hold power accountable, and embrace a capacious notion of human dignity.","Democracy is not compatible with capitalism but is congruent with a version of democratic socialism in which the wealth, resources, and benefits of a social order are shared in an equitable and just manner.","The stories a society tells about itself are a measure of how it values itself, the ideals of democracy, and its future.","Since the 1970s, we have witnessed the forces of market fundamentalism strip education of its public values, critical content, and civic responsibilities as part of its broader goal of creating new subjects wedded to consumerism, risk-free relationships, and the destruction of the social state.","The discipline, particularly in these urban schools for the poor, it's not controlled by the administration - they're controlled by the police. This is an expression of a racist logic that has now seeped directly into schools.","America's addiction to violence is partly evident in the heroes it chooses to glorify.","Neoliberalism considers the discourse of equality, justice, and democracy quaint, if not dangerous and must be either trivialized, turned into its Orwellian opposite, or eviscerated from public life.","America has become amnesiac, a country in which forms of historical, political, and moral forgetting are not only willfully practiced but celebrated.","Democracy as a promise means that society can never be just enough and that the self-reflection and struggles that enable all members of the community to participate in the decisions and institutions that shape their lives must be continually debated, safeguarded, and preserved at all costs.","Collective freedom is one devoid of material bondage and one that supports the institutions necessary for democracy.","Angela Davis's legacy as a freedom fighter made her an enemy of the state under the increasingly neoliberal regimes of Nixon, Reagan and J. Edgar Hoover because she understood that the struggle for freedom was not only a struggle for political and individual rights but also for economic rights.","What is invaluable about Angela Davis' work is that she does not limit her politics to issues removed from broader social considerations, but connects every aspect of her scholarship and public interventions to what the contours of a truly democratic society might look like.","The biggest lie of all is that capitalism is democracy. We have no way of understanding democracy outside of the market, just as we have no understanding of how to understand freedom outside of market values.","A citizen is a political and moral agent who in fact has a shared sense of hope and responsibility to others and not just to him or herself.","To see poor people, their benefits being cut, to see pensions of Americans who have worked like my father, all their lives, and taken away, to see the rich just accumulating more and more wealth. I mean, it seems to me that there has to be a point where you have to say, 'No, this has to stop.'","Public schools are not simply being corporatized, they are also subjected increasingly to a militarizing logic that disciplines the bodies of young people, especially low income and poor minorities, and shapes their desires and identities in the service of military values and social relations.","I think that rather than saying that Occupy Wall Street has died, we can say that they're in the process of understanding what the long march through alternative institutions might mean.","Power is never so overwhelming that there's no room for resistance.","Undermining life-affirming social solidarities and any viable notion of the public good, right-wing politicians trade in forms of idiocy and superstition that mesmerize the illiterate and render the thoughtful cynical and disengaged.","As politics is disconnected from its ethical and material moorings, it becomes easier to punish and imprison young people than to educate them.","'American Sniper' is a film that erases history, spectacularizes violence, and reduces war and its aftermath to cheap entertainment, with an underexplained referent to the mental problems many vets live with when they return home from the war.","Domestic terrorism has opened new war zones, operating off the assumption that all Americans are potential terrorists.","The new elites have no allegiances to nation states and don't care about the damage they do to workers, the environment, or the rest of humanity. They are unhinged sociopaths, far removed from what the Occupy Movement called the '99 percent.'","In order for critical pedagogy, dialogue, and thought to have real effects, they must advocate the message that all citizens, old and young, are equally entitled, if not equally empowered, to shape the society in which they live.","What has become clear to many Americans is that the electoral system is bankrupt. As the political process becomes more privatized, outsourced, and overrun with money from corporations and billionaires, a wounded republic is on its death bed, gasping for life."],"Henry Gray":["Surgical Anatomy is, to the student of medicine and surgery, the most essential branch of anatomical science, having reference more especially to an accurate knowledge of the more important regions, and consisting in the application of anatomy generally to the practice of surgery.","The eyeball is contained in the cavity of the orbit. In this situation, it is securely protected from injury, whilst its position is such as to ensure the most extensive range of sight.","Bone is one of the hardest structures of the animal body; it possesses also a certain degree of toughness and elasticity.","The general framework of the body is built up mainly of a series of bones, supplemented, however, in certain regions by pieces of cartilage; the bony part of the framework constitutes the skeleton.","The muscles are connected with the bones, cartilages, ligaments, and skin, either directly or through the intervention of fibrous structures called tendons or aponeuroses.","In the dissection of the muscles, attention should be directed to the exact origin, insertion, and actions of each, and to its more important relations with surrounding parts.","Descriptive Anatomy comprises a detailed account of the numerous organs of which the body is formed, especially with reference to their outward form, their internal structure, the mutual relations they bear to each other, and the successive conditions they present during their development.","The appendages of the skin are the nails, the hairs, the sudoriferous and sebaceous glands, and their ducts. The nails and hairs are peculiar modifications of the epidermis, consisting essentially of the same cellular structure as that membrane.","In the imperfect records left of the anatomy of the ancient Egyptians, no trace of any knowledge of the spleen can be ascertained.","The entire substance of the spleen at an early period is almost entirely composed of nuclei and granular matter.","The vesicles of the spleen, which form one of the most important elements of this organ in its mature state, are not developed until the period of incubation is near to its completion.","The earliest period at which I have been able to detect the existence of the spleen in the human embryo is at the second month.","I believe that the power which the spleen possesses of regulating its amount of blood depends entirely upon mechanical properties.","I have removed the spleen from a dog, from cats, and rabbits. In all cases, the animals survived the operation and did not appear to be in the least affected by the absence of the organ.","The arteries are found in nearly every part of the animal body, with the exception of the hairs, nails, and epidermis; and the larger trunks usually occupy the most protected situations, running, in the limbs, along the flexor side, where they are less exposed to injury.","Fracture of the patella may be produced by muscular action or by direct violence. When produced by muscular action, it occurs thus: a person in danger of falling forwards attempts to recover himself by throwing the body backwards, and the violent action of the quadriceps extensor upon the patella snaps the bone transversely across."],"Henry Grunwald":["A beach is not only a sweep of sand, but shells of sea creatures, the sea glass, the seaweed, the incongruous objects washed up by the ocean.","It is part of the fundamental impulse in all living things to reach for light, part of the indomitable will to see.","My eyes don't work, at least not fully, because they are blocked by disease. The scene around me appears through a kind of curtain, a haze.","Rationally, I was convinced that the universe without God made no sense, but that simply was not the same as believing. But I also knew that I could not argue myself, or be argued, into faith.","Journalists are in the same madly rocking boat as diplomats and statesmen. Like them, when the Cold War ended, they looked for a new world order and found a new world disorder. If making and conducting foreign policy in today's turbulent environment is difficult, so is practicing journalism.","Like other Americans, U.S. journalists have often neglected the study of history; they have much remedial work to do in trying to understand who did what to whom, why and when - and who did it first.","The new history is really ancient history newly discovered. Journalists are taking crash courses in the blood-drenched background of Serbs, Croats, Bosnians, North Ossetians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis.","The Democrats have nothing to cheer but fear itself.","See it all.

But what do you do after that? The black community doesn't have institutions that pick up such moments and preserve them.","Food might be more immediately important than history but if you don't understand what's been done to you - by your own people and the so-called 'they' - you can never get around it.","Everybody needs history but the people who need it most are poor folks - people without resources or options.","What drives people to public service is a sense of possibility. If you haven't sensed that possibility you don't get started in the same way, you don't feel you can have an impact.","If you're black in America, race is a factor in your life. Start with that assumption.","On the one hand, there is no reason that a black person needs to live a portion of his or her life being concerned about the people of color around him. On the other hand, if you don't you're crazy.","We don't have a full black community in Boston. Our people are scattered. There's a middle class where I live in Highland Park but it's not like a piece of Washington or Chicago."],"Henry Hazlitt":["The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.","The 'private sector' of the economy is, in fact, the voluntary sector; and the 'public sector' is, in fact, the coercive sector.","The ideas which now pass for brilliant innovations and advances are in fact mere revivals of ancient errors, and a further proof of the dictum that those who are ignorant of the past are condemned to repeat it.","The first requisite of a sound monetary system is that it put the least possible power over the quantity or quality of money in the hands of the politicians.","A strong passion for any object will ensure success, for the desire of the end will point out the means."],"Henry Home":["A rich man cannot enjoy a sound mind nor a sound body without exercise and abstinence; and yet these are truly the worst ingredients of poverty.","Violent passions are formed in solitude.

Whether it's right or wrong, I've just got to believe this is the reason why I am doing this and just go with it.","I swim. I do a little bit of surfing. I would say I'm a beginner at surfing. I run. I cycle. I play a little bit of soccer.","I feel like I'm part of television history.","In an ideal world, I'd love to work on something that is on par with 'Lost' or better than 'Lost.'","I love my life.","'Lost' fans were fantastic fans. I've said this before, but they were rabid, and they questioned everything - they were merciless, but I loved them for that.","The viewing figures for 'Lost' were huge. I don't think the viewing figures for 'The 100' are up there with 'Lost'; hopefully, they will be.","That's the thing with 'Lost': you can put a spin on so many things.","I would like to have a 'Lost' clapper board with the numbers and the clock at the top.","I was born in Peru, and we moved to Scotland when I was 15, but I've not lived here for a long time. But I would always say that I am Scottish, and Scotland is as close to a home as I have.","I love working in TV. TV is fast. You shoot it, and it's done quickly.","I was a theater actor back in the U.K., and you knew the whole play, so you could plot your storyline and character. And then I did 'Lost' and didn't know, and it was kind of frustrating, but I enjoyed it.","I think any parent, at some time or other, has thoughts of their child dying. That's probably one of the worst things that could ever happen to a parent.","For all the creationists out there, Darwin's just an atheist. But he was actually agnostic.","'Not Another Happy Ending' is a romantic comedy starring Karen Gillan and Stanley Weber. It is about these two characters and their relationships.","I like romantic comedies, as it is a fun and light thing to get involved with.","My theatre background is probably more extensive then my film, and I have done a fair bit of television.","In film, I think that you do have a little more time to invest in the character compared to television, where you are shooting from the hip and making quick choices. It is the speed of things that is the major difference - certainly in my experience.","I love Terry O'Quinn. He's a wonderful guy, wonderful actor.","I do have to go to the gym, which I don't enjoy that much.","Coming off a show like 'Lost,' there were other offers, but it was difficult to get excited about anything because 'Lost' was such a great piece of writing and such a hit show.","When I was filming 'Lost,' we'd be in the jungle. The only thing we had to contend with was the sound of the ocean. That was it, really.","I love the sci-fi world and the way it makes me start to question things.","I started watching 'Star Trek' as a kid.","I feel like there's a lot of great writing on television.","With television, I worked on 'Lost,' where you'd just put your faith in the writers and go with what they're writing.","'Scandal' is a huge hit. I'm happy for them, but it was never a really good fit for me.","I did work a lot in Scots theatre, but I was never really successful in Scottish film or TV until I went down to London - and I had to go to the U.S. to get my big break.","I'd imagine if there were more Scottish people making Scottish movies about Scotland, it would not only be educational, but it would instill a sense of pride.","'Lost' was filmed in Hawaii, so we stayed there and loved it, so we thought, 'Why would we leave?' It is a bit like growing up in a bubble, but I don't think that's a bad thing, as you will eventually get out and see the real world."],"Henry Irving":["Into thy hands, O Lord.

The greater or less happiness of a people depends on the degree of promptitude with which the gulf is narrowed.","Our authorities leave us no doubt that the trust lodged with the oligarchy was sometimes abused, but it certainly ought not to be regarded as a mere usurpation or engine of tyranny.","The ancient Roman code belongs to a class of which almost every civilised nation in the world can show a sample, and which, so far as the Roman and Hellenic worlds were concerned, were largely diffused over them at epochs not widely distant from one another.","The epoch of Customary Law, and of its custody by a privileged order, is a very remarkable one.","The inquiries of the jurist are in truth prosecuted much as inquiry in physic and physiology was prosecuted before observation had taken the place of assumption.","The members of such a society consider that the transgression of a religious ordinance should be punished by civil penalties, and that the violation of a civil duty exposes the delinquent to divine correction.","The most celebrated system of jurisprudence known to the world begins, as it ends, with a Code.","The most superficial student of Roman history must be struck by the extraordinary degree in which the fortunes of the republic were affected by the presence of foreigners, under different names, on her soil.","The Roman Code was merely an enunciation in words of the existing customs of the Roman people.","The Roman jurisprudence has the longest known history of any set of human institutions.","When primitive law has once been embodied in a Code, there is an end to what may be called its spontaneous development."],"Henry James":["Do not mind anything that anyone tells you about anyone else. Judge everyone and everything for yourself.","Summer afternoon, summer afternoon; to me those have always been the two most beautiful words in the English language.","Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind.","There are few hours in life more agreeable than the hour dedicated to the ceremony known as afternoon tea.","It takes an endless amount of history to make even a little tradition.","The right time is any time that one is still so lucky as to have.","Deep experience is never peaceful.","We work in the dark - we do what we can - we give what we have. Our doubt is our passion and our passion is our task. The rest is the madness of art.","One might enumerate the items of high civilization, as it exists in other countries, which are absent from the texture of American life, until it should become a wonder to know what was left.","The only reason for the existence of a novel is that it does attempt to represent life.","Experience is never limited, and it is never complete; it is an immense sensibility, a kind of huge spider-web of the finest silken threads suspended in the chamber of consciousness, and catching every air-borne particle in its tissue.","It is art that makes life, makes interest, makes importance... and I know of no substitute whatever for the force and beauty of its process.","What is character but the determination of incident? What is incident but the illustration of character?","Cats and monkeys; monkeys and cats; all human life is there.","I've always been interested in people, but I've never liked them.","It is, I think, an indisputable fact that Americans are, as Americans, the most self-conscious people in the world, and the most addicted to the belief that the other nations of the earth are in a conspiracy to under value them.","In museums and palaces we are alternate radicals and conservatives.","The only success worth one's powder was success in the line of one's idiosyncrasy... what was talent but the art of being completely whatever one happened to be?","There are two kinds of taste, the taste for emotions of surprise and the taste for emotions of recognition.","Though there are some disagreeable things in Venice there is nothing so disagreeable as the visitors.","Live all you can; it's a mistake not to. It doesn't so much matter what you do in particular, so long as you have your life. If you haven't had that what have you had?","I think I don't regret a single 'excess' of my responsive youth - I only regret, in my chilled age, certain occasions and possibilities I didn't embrace.","A man who pretends to understand women is bad manners. For him to really to understand them is bad morals.","The face of nature and civilization in this our country is to a certain point a very sufficient literary field. But it will yield its secrets only to a really grasping imagination. To write well and worthily of American things one need even more than elsewhere to be a master.","Under certain circumstances there are few hours in life more agreeable than the hour dedicated to the ceremony known as afternoon tea.","People talk about the conscience, but it seems to me one must just bring it up to a certain point and leave it there. You can let your conscience alone if you're nice to the second housemaid.","If I were to live my life over again, I would be an American. I would steep myself in America, I would know no other land.","In art economy is always beauty.","Young men of this class never do anything for themselves that they can get other people to do for them, and it is the infatuation, the devotion, the superstition of others that keeps them going.

If I could pronounce the name James in any different or more elaborate way I should be in favor of doing it.","Life is a predicament which precedes death.","Ideas are, in truth, force.","An Englishman's never so natural as when he's holding his tongue.","I adore adverbs; they are the only qualifications I really much respect.","The only obligation to which in advance we may hold a novel, without incurring the accusation of being arbitrary, is that it be interesting.","The superiority of one man's opinion over another's is never so great as when the opinion is about a woman.","I hold any writer sufficiently justified who is himself in love with his theme.","Money's a horrid thing to follow, but a charming thing to meet.","It takes a great deal of history to produce a little literature.","However British you may be, I am more British still.","To kill a human being is, after all, the least injury you can do him.","It's a complex fate, being an American, and one of the responsibilities it entails is fighting against a superstitious valuation of Europe.","To criticize is to appreciate, to appropriate, to take intellectual possession, to establish in fine a relation with the criticized thing and to make it one's own."],"Henry Kissinger":["There cannot be a crisis next week.

And it is now far enough away so that one can study without using the slogans to see what's really happened.","No foreign policy - no matter how ingenious - has any chance of success if it is born in the minds of a few and carried in the hearts of none.","You can't make war in the Middle East without Egypt and you can't make peace without Syria.","The American foreign policy trauma of the sixties and seventies was caused by applying valid principles to unsuitable conditions.","America has fought five wars since 1945 and has gained its objectives in only one of them, the Gulf War.","If I should ever be captured, I want no negotiation - and if I should request a negotiation from captivity they should consider that a sign of duress.","Everybody has a hacking capability. And probably every intelligence service is hacking in the territory of other countries. But who exactly does what? That would be a very sensitive piece of information. But it's very difficult to communicate about it. Because nobody wants to admit the scope of what they're doing.","The absence of alternatives clears the mind marvelously.","The longer I am out of office, the more infallible I appear to myself.","I don't see why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist due to the irresponsibility of its people. The issues are much too important for the Chilean voters to be left to decide for themselves.","Each success only buys an admission ticket to a more difficult problem.","Power is the great aphrodisiac.","The conventional army loses if it does not win. The guerrilla wins if he does not lose.","For other nations, utopia is a blessed past never to be recovered; for Americans it is just beyond the horizon.","Moderation is a virtue only in those who are thought to have an alternative.","If eighty percent of your sales come from twenty percent of all of your items, just carry those twenty percent.","Any fact that needs to be disclosed should be put out now or as quickly as possible, because otherwise the bleeding will not end.","Blessed are the people whose leaders can look destiny in the eye without flinching but also without attempting to play God.","We cannot always assure the future of our friends; we have a better chance of assuring our future if we remember who our friends are.","The security of Israel is a moral imperative for all free peoples.","Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton both had exceptional natural abilities. Nelson Rockefeller was very good statewide but never gained national traction.","Donald Trump is a phenomenon that foreign countries haven't seen. So it is a shocking experience to them that he came in to office.","The Vietnam War required us to emphasize the national interest rather than abstract principles. What President Nixon and I tried to do was unnatural. And that is why we didn't make it.","While we should never give up our principles, we must also realize that we cannot maintain our principles unless we survive.","Art is man's expression of his joy in labor.","The high probability is if American forces withdraw from Afghanistan and if no alternative international arrangement is made that then the historic contests between the regions and the sects will reappear, the Taliban will re-emerge, and a very complicated and maybe chaotic situation will develop.","Ninety percent of the politicians give the other ten percent a bad reputation.","It is, after all, the responsibility of the expert to operate the familiar and that of the leader to transcend it.","University politics are vicious precisely because the stakes are so small.","Leaders must invoke an alchemy of great vision.","The tragedy of America is that it entered all the wars with a consensus in favor of them, but within a defined period, the legitimacy of the war became a major domestic issue, with some people arguing that withdrawal was the only legitimate objective.","It's never happened in history that every region in the world could affect every other region simultaneously. The Roman empire and the Chinese empire didn't know much about each other and had no means of interacting. Now we have every continent able to reach every other.","The Trump phenomenon is in large part a reaction of Middle America to attacks on its values by intellectual and academic communities. There are other reasons, but this is a significant one.","I think when the president of the United States calls for military action, he should do it for a united people, especially when the methods have been so cruel, so explicitly directed at Americans.","There has come into being a kind of a Shia belt from Tehran through Baghdad to Beirut. And this gives Iran the opportunity to reconstruct the ancient Persian Empire - this time under the Shia label.","The nice thing about being a celebrity is that, if you bore people, they think it's their fault.","To be absolutely certain about something, one must know everything or nothing about it.","The superpowers often behave like two heavily armed blind men feeling their way around a room, each believing himself in mortal peril from the other, whom he assumes to have perfect vision.","I don't ascribe to myself any special competence in economic insight. I translate what I hear from highly intelligent people into political and philosophical propositions.","I don't see the wisdom in modern politicians that I once saw in men like Dean Acheson, David Bruce, or George Marshall. In my day, the northeastern establishment dominated foreign policy formulation, but the composition and distribution of our population is very different today.","No one will ever win the battle of the sexes; there's too much fraternizing with the enemy.","The statesman's duty is to bridge the gap between his nation's experience and his vision.","A leader does not deserve the name unless he is willing occasionally to stand alone.","I have spoken to Chinese leaders occasionally on human rights, but I've always done it in private.","No country can act wisely simultaneously in every part of the globe at every moment of time.","The American temptation is to believe that foreign policy is a subdivision of psychiatry.","Whatever must happen ultimately should happen immediately.","Even a paranoid can have enemies.","The essence of Richard Nixon is loneliness.","I am being frank about myself in this book. I tell of my first mistake on page 850.","Leaders are responsible not for running public opinion polls but for the consequences of their actions.","My view of my role is that together with like-minded men and women, I could help contribute to a bipartisan view of American engagement in the world for another period; I could do my part to overcome this really, in a way, awful period in which we are turning history into personal recriminations, depriving our political system of a serious debate.","I have been a professor, and I have been a policymaker, and as a professor, you think in terms of truth or absolutes.","We are moving towards a world that is reordering itself and that may appear more ordered at some periods of time, but I see no sign that we are moving towards a world order in my definition of it - namely, a system which is accepted, which is internalized by the majority of the key participants.","Leadership is absolutely vital if there are comparable countries which can affect the security of the world you live in. Between Lincoln and Roosevelt's time, America was protected by huge oceans and, in practice, by the British navy. Today, it's different, and the obsession of the Obama administration has been for retrenchment.","High office teaches decision making, not substance. It consumes intellectual capital; it does not create it. Most high officials leave office with the perceptions and insights with which they entered; they learn how to make decisions but not what decisions to make.","It was a Greek tragedy. Nixon was fulfilling his own nature. Once it started it could not end otherwise.","The illegal we do immediately. The unconstitutional takes a little longer.","We are all the President's men.","If it's going to come out eventually, better have it come out immediately.","In crises the most daring course is often safest.","People are generally amazed that I would take an interest in any forum that would require me to stop talking for three hours.","A leader who confines his role to his people's experience dooms himself to stagnation; a leader who outstrips his people's experience runs the risk of not being understood.","Most foreign policies that history has marked highly, in whatever country, have been originated by leaders who were opposed by experts.","There is obviously a gap between the public's perception of the role of U.S. foreign policy and the elite's perception.","A president has an inescapable responsibility to provide direction: What are we trying to achieve? What are we trying to prevent? Why? To do that, he has to both analyze and reflect.","I think that America's recovery of a global strategic view is an absolutely essential element of our foreign policy.","I have not endorsed Trump and will not do so.","Every first-term president has to learn something after he comes into office. Nobody can be completely ready for the inevitable crises.","I think we would find, if you study the conduct of guerilla-type wars, that the Obama Administration has hit more targets on a broader scale than the Nixon Administration ever did.","The attitude of the West and of Russia towards a crisis like Ukraine is diametrically different. The West is trying to establish the legality of any established border. For Russia, Ukraine is part of the Russian patrimony."],"Henry Knox":["Something is wanting, and something must be done, or we shall be involved in all the horror of failure, and civil war without a prospect of its termination.","That taxes may be the ostensible cause is true, but that they are the true cause is as far remote from truth as light from darkness.","We have arrived at that point of time in which we are forced to see our own humiliation, as a nation, and that a progression in this line cannot be a productive of happiness, private or public.","Every friend to the liberty of his country is bound to reflect, and step forward to prevent the dreadful consequences which shall result from a government of events.","We imagined that the mildness of our government and the wishes of the people were so correspondent that we were not as other nations, requiring brutal force to support the laws.","The powers of Congress are totally inadequate to preserve the balance between the respective States, and oblige them to do those things which are essential for their own welfare or for the general good.","The frame of mind in the local legislatures seems to be exerted to prevent the federal constitution from having any good effect.","Having proceeded to this length, for which they are now ripe, we shall have a formidable rebellion against reason, the principle of all government, and against the very name of liberty.","They wish for a general government of unity, as they see that the local legislatures must naturally and necessarily tend to retard the general government.","Our political machine, composed of thirteen independent sovereignties, have been perpetually operating against each other and against the federal head ever since the peace.","Men at a distance, who have admired our systems of government unfounded in nature, are apt to accuse the rulers, and say that taxes have been assessed too high and collected too rigidly."],"Henry Kravis":["If you don't have integrity, you have nothing. You can't buy it. You can have all the money in the world, but if you are not a moral and ethical person, you really have nothing.","Giving back is something that comes from the heart to me. It's not that I do it because it's the right thing: I do it because I want do it.","If you build that foundation, both the moral and the ethical foundation, as well as the business foundation, and the experience foundation, then the building won't crumble.","If you have something at risk, you think differently.","It's not just buying the company. Sure, we picked the right companies, and we picked the right management and, most importantly, we've given them the right incentive to perform.","I thought at the time that I wanted to go into institutional sales, selling stocks and bonds to institutions. In those days, which was the 1960s, the institutional salesman was making about $100,000 a year. I thought that was just an enormous amount of money.","Look, don't congratulate us when we buy a company, congratulate us when we sell it. Because any fool can overpay and buy a company, as long as money will last to buy it.","The trouble, in my opinion, with corporate America today, is that everything is thought of in quarters.","If we can just take a few companies, and use those as models, as examples, to show the rest of corporate America how they can become more competitive, that's what I'd like to do and that's what I hope to do.","I've been in a hurry all my life. I've been in a hurry to succeed, and in a hurry to prove myself.","I was an economics major in college, and every summer after school, I would drive my car from California, from Claremont men's college at the time, to New York. And I worked on Wall Street.","It's one of the most important things at the end of the day, being able to say no to an investment.","But once you buy a company, you are married. You are married to that company.","I always like to refer managers in corporate America as the renters of the corporate assets, not the owners.","So I picked a field where I had a little exposure. Where I thought I could have an enormous challenge, and have a chance to really do some good, to be a pioneer in an area, and not just be like everyone else.","One, I love the creativity. I love the ability to create a capital structure that is appropriate for a company, no matter what field it happens to be in.","I love the ability to work with very good managers, and to provide the right incentives for them, and truly become a partner with that management, and make that management take a long view.","I have, in my partner George Roberts, a person who is the most wonderful man in the world to me. He's like a brother to me. Creating with him, being side by side with him, in whatever we try to do, is a real pleasure to me.","I want people who will stand up to me. People who are not afraid to say exactly what's on their minds, even though that's probably not what I want to hear. That's what I want.","As I said there is nothing wrong with failing. Pick yourself up and try it again. You never are going to know how good you really are until you go out and face failure.","You only have one thing to sell in life, and that's yourself.","It used to be that you would go in to see a CEO, and you would ask them, 'Is your company for sale?' and if they said 'No, we have no interest in selling,' that was sort of the end of the conversation.","In the '70s and '80s, what private equity did is it changed corporate America. It started holding companies accountable, and for the first time managers started thinking like owners.","Quite frankly, the financial community has to improve its image. The financial community has to be much more transparent than it is."],"Henry L. Stimson":["The only way to make a man trustworthy is to trust him.","We had news this morning of another successful atomic bomb being dropped on Nagasaki. These two heavy blows have fallen in quick succession upon the Japanese and there will be quite a little space before we intend to drop another.","The chief lesson I have learned in a long life is that the only way you can make a man trustworthy is to trust him; and the surest way to make him untrustworthy is to distrust him.","But I think the bomb instead constitutes merely a first step in a new control by man over the forces of nature too revolutionary and dangerous to fit into old concepts.","There has been growing quite a strain of irritating feeling between our government and the Russians and it seems to me that it is a time for me to use all the restraint I can on these other people who have been apparently getting a little more irritated.","I told him there was one city that they must not bomb without my permission and that was Kyoto.","Now the thing is not to get into unnecessary quarrels by talking too much and not to indicate any weakness by talking too much; let our actions speak for themselves.","Gentlemen don't read each other's mail.","I told him that my own opinion was that the time now and the method now to deal with Russia was to keep our mouths shut and let our actions speak for words.","The bomb and the entrance of the Russians into the war will certainly have an effect on hastening the victory.","I think it is very important that I should have a talk with you as soon as possible on a highly secret matter. I mentioned it to you shortly after you took office but have not urged it since on account of the pressure you have been under.","It seems as if everybody in the country was getting impatient to get his or her particular soldier out of the Army and to upset the carefully arranged system of points for retirement which we had arranged with the approval of the Army itself.","We debated long over the situation for it is a very difficult question and all of us recognize its difficulty.","The President so far has struck me as a man who is trying hard to keep his balance. He certainly has been very receptive to all my efforts in these directions.","The only deadly sin I know is cynicism.","I do not see how the Japanese can hold out against this united front.","Over any such tangled wave of problems the S-1 secret would be dominant and yet we will not know until after that time probably, until after that meeting, whether this is a weapon in our hands or not.","We think it will be shortly afterwards, but it seems a terrible thing to gamble with such big stakes in diplomacy without having your master card in your hand.","The Japanese campaign involves therefore two great uncertainties; first, whether Russia will come in though we think that will be all right; and second, when and how S-1 will resolve itself.","Russia will occupy most of the good food lands of central Europe while we have the industrial portions. We must find some way of persuading Russia to play ball.","As to the war with Japan, the President had already received my memorandum in general as to the possibility of getting a substantial unconditional surrender from Japan which I had written before leaving Washington and which he had approved.","After I had gone through this matter with the President I told him of my condition of health and that my doctors felt that I must take a complete rest and that I thought that that meant leaving the Department finally in a short time."],"Henry Laurens":["Finally, gentleman, from the considerations above mentioned, as I cannot consistently with my own honor, nor with utility to my country, considering the manner in which Business is transacted here, remain any longer in this chair, I now resign it.","I shall have less cause to regret the carrying my intended purpose into effect, foreseeing that you may immediately fill with advantage, the vacancy which will presently happen.","I shall hold myself particularly answerable to my constituents for my present conduct, and in general to all my fellow Citizens throughout these States, when properly questioned.","My bravery however was the effect of assurance for could I have believed the current report, I should have fled as fast as any man, no man can possibly have a greater reluctance to an intimacy with Sir William Howe than my Self."],"Henry Lawson":["Beer makes you feel the way you ought to feel without beer.","It is a matter of public shame that while we have now commemorated our hundredth anniversary, not one in every ten children attending Public schools throughout the colonies is acquainted with a single historical fact about Australia.","Oh, my ways are strange ways and new ways and old ways, And deep ways and steep ways and high ways and low, I'm at home and at ease on a track that I know not, And restless and lost on a road that I know.","And opposite the bench, the dock, divided by a partition, with the women to the left and the men to the right, as it is on the stairs or the block in polite society.","We shall never be understood or respected by the English until we carry our individuality to extremes, and by asserting our independence, become of sufficient consequence in their eyes to merit a closer study than they have hitherto accorded us.","It is the same with revolution; so long as the proper spirit is spreading amongst our young men, we are satisfied that it spreads without bombast or parade.","The Giraffe took the horse's head and led him along on the most level parts of the road towards the railway station, and two or three chaps went along to help get the sick man into the train.","The children are taught more of the meanest state in Europe than of the country they are born and bred in, despite the singularity of its characteristics, the interest of its history, the rapidity of its advance, and the stupendous promise of its future.","It is quite time that our children were taught a little more about their country, for shame's sake.","On the same line of reasoning, if Australians were to be Australians, or rather if Australians were as separate from any other nation as Australia from any other land, there would be no jealousy between them on England's account.","Why on earth do we want closer connection with England? We have little in common with English people except our language. We are fast becoming an entirely different people.","Who says Australia offers not a home for every poor Englishman, or any other countryman that finds his way to our shores? And what sort of thanks do we get for it?"],"Henry Longhurst":["Playing golf is like learning a foreign language.","If you call on God to improve the results of a shot while it is still in motion, you are using 'an outside agency' and subject to appropriate penalties under the rules of golf."],"Henry Louis Gates":["The sad truth is that the civil rights movement cannot be reborn until we identify the causes of black suffering, some of them self-inflicted. Why can't black leaders organize rallies around responsible sexuality, birth within marriage, parents reading to their children and students staying in school and doing homework?","Diversity doesn't mean black and white only.","Censorship is to art as lynching is to justice.","Cuba is like going to a whole other planet. It's so different but it's so similar to the United States, to Miami. It's like a doppelgaenger. It's the mirror image. And I have no doubt, that once Cuba becomes democratic, that it will be the favorite tourist destination for Americans.","If you share a common ancestor with somebody, you're related to them. It doesn't mean that you're going to invite them to the family reunion, but it means that you share DNA.","In America there is institutional racism that we all inherit and participate in, like breathing the air in this room - and we have to become sensitive to it.","But you see, our society is still trapped in this binary, black/white logic and that has had some very positive implications for our generation. It's had some very negative ones as well and one of the negative ones is that it creates enormous identity problems for people who have one black ancestor and all white ancestors for example.","You have to have a canon so the next generation can come along and explode it.","No one thinks of Mexico and Peru as black. But Mexico and Peru together got 700,000 Africans in the slave trade. The coast of Acapulco was a black city in the 1870s. And the Veracruz Coast on the gulf of Mexico and the Costa Chica, south of Acapulco are traditional black lands.","The thing about black history is that the truth is so much more complex than anything you could make up.","You notice patterns. White guests often are mortified - that word again - when they learn their ancestors owned slaves. But I've never had a black guest who was upset to learn about white ancestry that probably involved forced sexual relations.","My father and I made genetics history. We were the first African-Americans and the first father and son anywhere to have their genomes sequenced.","I believe in the law. I think we have a great system of justice. But I do think that system of justice has been corrupted by racism and classism. I think it's difficult for 'poor people' - poor white people, brown people - to be treated fairly before the law in the same way that upper-class people are.","The sad truth is that without complex business partnerships between African elites and European traders and commercial agents, the slave trade to the New World would have been impossible, at least on the scale it occurred.","I rebel at the notion that I can't be part of other groups, that I can't construct identities through elective affinity, that race must be the most important thing about me. Is that what I want on my gravestone: Here lies an African American?","Patriotism is best exemplified through auto-critique. When you're willing to stand up within the group and say, 'It is wrong for Black people to be anti-Semitic,' or 'It is wrong for America to discriminate against persons of African descent and made them slaves and based its wealth upon free labor,' it's crucial to say that.","I think that the roots of racism have always been economic, and I think people are desperate and scared. And when you're desperate and scared you scapegoat people. It exacerbates latent tendencies toward - well, toward racism or homophobia or anti-Semitism.","Ever since I watched 'Roots,' I've dreamed of tracing my African ancestry and helping other people do the same.","My mom, God rest her soul - she liked nicknames. In the womb she named me Skip. There was another black guy in Piedmont, W.Va., and his name was Skip. They called him Big Skip, and I was Little Skip.","I want to be a figure for prison reform. I think that the criminal justice system is rotten.","My father lived to be 97 and played bridge every day up to the end, so I've got a 50 percent chance of living a long life like him.","It turns out one of my ancestors fought in the Continental Army, so I was inducted into the Sons of the American Revolution.","There are just so many stories that are buried on family trees.","I'm looking forward to the time when we all look like Polynesians.","People don't realize what a brilliant politician Lincoln was. Looking back, we want to ascribe a level of providence to his every decision but he was a cunning and calculating politician; from the cultivation of his image as a hayseed from Illinois, to his ability to keep this country together under dire circumstances.","Let's face it - think of Africa, and the first images that come to mind are of war, poverty, famine and flies. How many of us really know anything at all about the truly great ancient African civilizations, which in their day, were just as splendid and glorious as any on the face of the earth?","The African American's relationship to Africa has long been ambivalent, at least since the early nineteenth century, when 3,000 black men crowded into Bishop Richard Allen's African Methodist Episcopal Church in Philadelphia to protest noisily a plan to recolonize free blacks in Africa.","For as long as I can remember, I have been passionately intrigued by 'Africa,' by the word itself, by its flora and fauna, its topographical diversity and grandeur; but above all else, by the sheer variety of the colors of its people, from tan and sepia to jet and ebony.","People who own property feel a sense of ownership in their future and their society. They study, save, work, strive and vote. And people trapped in a culture of tenancy do not.","The Right insists that anyone can escape poverty by working hard but that is simply not the case.","If you share a common ancestor with somebody, you're related to them. It doesn't mean that you're going to invite them to the family reunion, but it means that you share DNA. I think it's fascinating.","It's very lonely being a prominent black intellectual at an institution where you're the only prominent black intellectual. That was the model that was followed in the late 60s when black studies started. You'd get one here and one there and one here, like Johnny Appleseed.","I don't think the riots derailed the civil rights movement.","Color categories are on steroids in Latin America. I find that fascinating. It's very difficult for Americans, particularly African-Americans to understand or sympathize with.","My father, if anything, first and last, was a man of words. He loved stories; he didn't live for stories, exactly, but I think he lived through stories. I think, like many writers, he loved stories about things he had experienced as much as, if not more than, he loved the experiences themselves.","Since the day Martin Luther King was killed, the black middle classes have almost quadrupled, but the percentage of black children living on or below the poverty line is almost the same.","In fact, the class divide in the black community is now seen by some as a permanent aspect of our existence.","Everything my mother and father did was designed to put me where I am.","One must learn how to be black in America.","I didn't feel particularly close to my father.","It's fascinating how life works.","What's fascinated me from the time I was a little kid was the way we construct our lives through stories.","My brother and I had a really privileged relationship with my parents... They treated us like adults.","I think that the implication of King's assassination has not been fully appreciated.","Dr. King's Nobel Prize had a more powerful transforming effect on him than I think he realized at the time.","Most black leaders, whether left, right or center, from Frederick Douglas and Martin Delaney on in the middle of the 19th century have not even wondered about the merits of the capitalist system.","Brazil is the second blackest nation in the world.","In America one drop of black ancestry makes you black.","My goal is to get everybody in America to do their family tree.","All historians generalize from particulars. And often, if you look at a historian's footnotes, the number of examples of specific cases is very, very small.","Very few, if any, first-generation black or white or Asian kids will pursue a Ph.D. They'll pursue the professions for economic security. Many will go to law school and/or business school.","Remember, I have a Ph.D. in English literature.","Lincoln had a tremendous capacity for personal growth - more than any other American President.","Because Lincoln is so closely identified with what it is to be American, everyone wants to claim him, to rewrite his story to satisfy their own particular needs.","It's no surprise that White people say things when they are together about Black people.","People are afraid, and when people are afraid, when their pie is shrinking, they look for somebody to hate. They look for somebody to blame. And a real leader speaks to anxiety and to fear and allays those fears, assuages anxiety.","Patriotism is best exemplified through auto-critique.","So many people of color who made major contributions to American history have been trapped in the purgatory of history.","I have no plans to slow down.","I'm a tech geek.","Suffering does not necessarily ennoble you.","Because Lincoln is so closely identified with what it is to be American, everyone wants to claim him, to rewrite his story to satisfy their own particular needs. For my own people, it was important to imagine him as the Great Emancipator, the Moses who led us out of slavery.","Lincoln would love the fact that Obama is such a great conciliator, trying to transcend ideology.","Keeping the Union together, freeing slaves and being assassinated all added up to creating 'Lincoln the myth.' He overcame a lot of his own prejudices and became what many would consider the first black man's president.","The Dominican Republic says 'We're black behind the ears.' And in Mexico, 'there's a black grandma in the closet.' They know, they've just been intermarrying for a long time. But if we did the DNA of everyone in Mexico a whole lot of people would have a whole lot of black in them.","So, Mexico, Brazil, they wanted their national culture to be 'blackish' - really brown, a beautiful brown blend. And finally, I discovered that in each of these societies the people at the bottom are the darkest skinned with the most African features.","In America one drop of black ancestry makes you black. In Brazil, it's almost as if one drop of white ancestry makes you white.","We can revolutionize the attitude of inner city brown and black kids to learning. We need a civil rights movement within the African-American community.","You can say I had a severe case of 'Roots' envy. I wanted to be like Alex Haley, and I wanted to be able to... do my family tree back to the slave ship and then reverse the Middle Passage, as I like to put it, and find the tribe or ethnic group that I was from in Africa.","So when you do your family tree and Margaret Cho does hers, and... Wanda Sykes and John Legend... we're adding to the database that scholars can then draw from to generalize about the complexity of the American experience. And that's the contribution that family trees make to broader scholarship.","I first learned that there were black people living in some place called other than the United States in the western hemisphere when I was a very little boy, and my father told me that when he was a boy about my age, he wanted to be an Episcopal priest, because he so admired his priest, a black man from someplace called Haiti.","I knew that there were black people in Africa, of course, unfortunately because of movies such as 'Tarzan.'","There are two things that have always haunted me: the brutality of the European traders and the stories I've heard about Africans selling other Africans into slavery.","In Ethiopia, the black people became Christians 1700 years ago, hundreds of years before Northern Europe turned to Christianity... And here, most of the saints are black.","When Europeans came upon real ruined cities they refused to believe that they had been built by Africans. Here the past has been distorted and denied.","All of the guests on 'Faces of America' were deeply moved by what we revealed about their ancestry. We were able to trace the ancestry of Native American writer Louise Erdrich back to 438 A.D. We found that Queen Noor is descended from royalty, and that's before she married King Hussein of Jordan.","I would like to do a series about sequencing the human genome, and also analyze more human diversity among other ethnic groups - a 'Faces of America 2.'","We can't all work in the inner city. And, I don't even think that it is incumbent upon an African-American intellectual to be concerned in their work with problems of race and class. It's just one of the things, that we here at the DuBois Institute, are concerned about.","Well, certainly one of the ironies of the success of affirmative action is that the middle class within the black community no longer lives within 'black community' by and large.","I want to get into the educational DNA of American culture. I want 10 percent of the common culture, more or less, to be black.","I'm a tech geek. Whenever I read about something new, I think to myself, How can I take this and make it black?","One principle I've been fighting for that doesn't endear me to a lot of people is that black people can be just as complicated and screwed up as white people. Our motives can be just as base and violent. Suffering does not necessarily ennoble you.","What people forget is that the most radical thing about Obama is that he was the first black man in history to imagine that he could become president, who was able to make other Americans believe it as well. Other than that, he is a centrist, just like I try to be. He's been bridging divisions his whole life.","You have a diasporic black world, and the only way to put it back together again is symbolic. It's like Humpty Dumpty. Whoever could edit the 'Encyclopedia Africana' would provide symbolic order to the fragments created over the past 500 years. That is a major contribution.","A more humane form of capitalism is about the best I think we can get. Which might sound very reformist or conservative, but that's basically where I am.","Fortunately, in President Obama, the child of an African and an American, we finally have a leader who is uniquely positioned to bridge the great reparations divide.","My family and our neighbors and friends thought of Africa and its Africans as extensions of the stereotyped characters that we saw in movies and on television in films such as 'Tarzan' and in programs such as 'Ramar of the Jungle' and 'Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.'","The Western stereotype of Africa and its black citizens as devoid of reason and, therefore, subhuman was often shared by white master and black ex-slave alike.","My father was the funniest man I ever met. He made Redd Foxx look like an undertaker.","It's important to debunk the myths of Africa being this benighted continent civilized only when white people arrived. In fact, Africans had been creators of culture for thousands of years before. These were very intelligent, subtle and sophisticated people, with organized societies and great art.","There's a boom in genealogy now. With ancestry.com and other sites digitizing so many of the records, you can now find things in a few minutes that used to take months.","The historical basis for the gap between the black middle class and underclass shows that ending discrimination, by itself, would not eradicate black poverty and dysfunction. We also need intervention to promulgate a middle-class ethic of success among the poor, while expanding opportunities for economic betterment.","Politicians will not put forth programs aimed at the problems of poor blacks while their turnout remains so low.","The only people who live in a post-black world are four people who live in a little white house on Pennsylvania Avenue. The idea that America is post-racial or post-black because a man I admire, Barack Obama, is president of the United States, is a joke. And I hope no one will even wonder about this crazy fiction again.","America is the greatest nation ever founded. The ideals are the greatest ever espoused in human history, and we just need the country to live up to them. But what I worry about are the 1 million black men in the prison system.","The bottom line is that Wanda Sykes has the longest continuously documented family tree of any African-American we have ever researched.","Wherever you go in the history of America, there have been Black people making contributions, but their contributions have been obscured, lost, buried.","The most ironic outcome of the black Civil Rights movement has been the creation of a new black middle class which is increasingly separate from the black underclass.","If Martin Luther King came back, he'd say we need another civil rights movement built on class not race.","It's not white versus black any more, it's haves versus have-nots. Unless the black middle-classes unite to promote the interests of the black underclass, tension between them is inevitable. What we, the black middle class have to do, is think of a strategy to avert that.","My grandfather was coloured, my father was Negro, and I am Black.","First we have to recognize that the cause of poverty is both structural and behavioral. And the first thing about the behavior part is that we need a moral revolution within the African American community. Look - no white racist makes you get pregnant when you are a black teenager.","Really, the values under which my generation was raised in the '50s were immigrant values even though we weren't immigrants. The greatest thing you could be was a college-educated Negro.","You can find virtually everybody black back as far as the 1870 census. Why 1870? That's when the ex-slaves first have surnames. But if you find your great-great-grandfather in 1870 and it says he's 50, that means he was born in 1820 and you're back to 1820 already. For an American that's pretty damned good, you know?","I give a speech to the black freshmen at Harvard each year, and I say, 'You can like Mozart and ice hockey...' - and then I used to say 'golf,' but Tiger took over golf! - 'and Picasso and still be as black as the ace of spades.'"],"Henry M. Jackson":["The best politics is no politics.","The president's decision yesterday to set into motion the development of the hydrogen bomb... has placed us on the knife-edge of history."],"Henry M. Morris":["When science and the Bible differ, science has obviously misinterpreted its data.","The evolutionary explanation for origins, although impossible either to prove or to test scientifically, is nevertheless defended by its proponents on the basis that it is the only explanation which is naturalistic, not involving the 'supernatural' element of a divine Creator.","Creation is not taking place now, so far as can be observed. Therefore, it was accomplished sometime in the past, if at all, and thus is inaccessible to the scientific method.","It is impossible to devise a scientific experiment to describe the creation process, or even to ascertain whether such a process can take place. The Creator does not create at the whim of a scientist."],"Henry Markram":["The brain builds a version of the universe and projects this version of the universe like a bubble all around us. So I can say with some certainty, 'I think therefore I am.' But I cannot say, 'You think therefore you are,' because you are within my perceptual bubble.","Think of a forest, then imagine taking 10,000 trees and squeezing them together until there is essentially no space between them. That's what the neocortical column looks like.","The best way to figure out how something works is to try to build it from scratch.","I was always interested in curing the brain.","We cannot experimentally map out the brain. It's just too big. In a piece of the brain the size of a pinhead there are 3,000 pathways like a city with 3,000 streets.","You stimulate the neo-cortex, it produces a symphony. But it's not just a symphony of perception. It's a symphony of your universe. Your reality.","Today, you have neuroscientists working on a genetic, behavioural or cognitive level, and then you have informaticians, chemists and mathematicians. They all have their own understanding of how the brain functions and is structured. How do you get them all around the same table?","People are afraid of detail and complexity.","Everybody agrees that the brain is a remarkable machine. It's capable of generating an enormous number of phenomena, some of them very obvious and some of them less obvious. But I think that in the end there are going to be some very basic explanations for many things: emotions, awareness, consciousness, attention, perception, recognition.","All evidence indicates that the neuron does not reset. The synapses do not reset. They are always different. They're changing every millisecond. Your brain today is very, very different from what it was when you were 10 years old, and yet you may have profound memories from when you were 10.","Drug discovery is terribly expensive, just to find out how one drug could or could not work and all its side effects.","As scientists, we need to not be afraid of the truth.","A meticulous virtual copy of the human brain would enable basic research on brain cells and circuits or computer-based drug trials.","There are few scientists in the world with the resources I have at my disposal.","99 percent of what you see is not what comes in through the eyes. It is what you infer about that room."],"Henry Martyn":["Do not suppose, dearest Sir, that I am so short-sighted as to destroy my life by English preaching, or any other preaching.

I am the happiest man alive.","Develop an interest in life as you see it; the people, things, literature, music - the world is so rich, simply throbbing with rich treasures, beautiful souls and interesting people.

The only way in which anyone can lead us is to restore to us the belief in our own guidance.","We live in the mind, in ideas, in fragments. We no longer drink in the wild outer music of the streets - we remember only.","True strength lies in submission which permits one to dedicate his life, through devotion, to something beyond himself.","Moralities, ethics, laws, customs, beliefs, doctrines - these are of trifling import. All that matters is that the miraculous become the norm.","Madness is tonic and invigorating. It makes the sane more sane. The only ones who are unable to profit by it are the insane.","Every moment is a golden one for him who has the vision to recognize it as such.","Whatever needs to be maintained through force is doomed.","Why are we so full of restraint? Why do we not give in all directions? Is it fear of losing ourselves? Until we do lose ourselves there is no hope of finding ourselves.","We have two American flags always: one for the rich and one for the poor. When the rich fly it means that things are under control; when the poor fly it means danger, revolution, anarchy.","Back of every creation, supporting it like an arch, is faith. Enthusiasm is nothing: it comes and goes. But if one believes, then miracles occur.","In the attempt to defeat death man has been inevitably obliged to defeat life, for the two are inextricably related. Life moves on to death, and to deny one is to deny the other.","The man who looks for security, even in the mind, is like a man who would chop off his limbs in order to have artificial ones which will give him no pain or trouble.","Whatever there be of progress in life comes not through adaptation but through daring.","Confusion is a word we have invented for an order which is not understood.","The world dies over and over again, but the skeleton always gets up and walks.","We live at the edge of the miraculous.","Every man has his own destiny: the only imperative is to follow it, to accept it, no matter where it leads him.","The ordinary man is involved in action, the hero acts. An immense difference.","If we are always arriving and departing, it is also true that we are eternally anchored. One's destination is never a place but rather a new way of looking at things.","There is no salvation in becoming adapted to a world which is crazy.","Example moves the world more than doctrine. The great exemplars are the poets of action, and it makes little difference whether they be forces for good or forces for evil.","The tragedy of it is that nobody sees the look of desperation on my face. Thousands and thousands of us, and we're passing one another without a look of recognition.","In expanding the field of knowledge we but increase the horizon of ignorance.","If I am against the condition of the world, it is not because I am a moralist - it is because I want to laugh more.","One can be absolutely truthful and sincere even though admittedly the most outrageous liar. Fiction and invention are of the very fabric of life.","Life is constantly providing us with new funds, new resources, even when we are reduced to immobility. In life's ledger there is no such thing as frozen assets.","All growth is a leap in the dark, a spontaneous unpremeditated act without benefit of experience.","Sin, guilt, neurosis; they are one and the same, the fruit of the tree of knowledge.","Life is 440 horsepower in a 2-cylinder engine.","Whatever I do is done out of sheer joy; I drop my fruits like a ripe tree. What the general reader or the critic makes of them is not my concern.","The Teutons have been singing the swan song ever since they entered the ranks of history. They have always confounded truth with death.","Art is only a means to life, to the life more abundant. It is not in itself the life more abundant. It merely points the way, something which is overlooked not only by the public, but very often by the artist himself. In becoming an end it defeats itself.","The one thing we can never get enough of is love. And the one thing we never give enough is love.","It does me good to write a letter which is not a response to a demand, a gratuitous letter, so to speak, which has accumulated in me like the waters of a reservoir.","If there is to be any peace it will come through being, not having.","Until we accept the fact that life itself is founded in mystery, we shall learn nothing.","We do not talk - we bludgeon one another with facts and theories gleaned from cursory readings of newspapers, magazines and digests.","The man who is forever disturbed about the condition of humanity either has no problems of his own or has refused to face them.","Imagination is the voice of daring.

No, what the artist needs is loneliness.","The world is the mirror of myself dying.","Chaos is the score upon which reality is written.","One of the reasons why so few of us ever act, instead of react, is because we are continually stifling our deepest impulses.","Every man with a bellyful of the classics is an enemy to the human race.","Honest criticism means nothing: what one wants is unrestrained passion, fire for fire.","In this age, which believes that there is a short cut to everything, the greatest lesson to be learned is that the most difficult way is, in the long run, the easiest.","One has to be a lowbrow, a bit of a murderer, to be a politician, ready and willing to see people sacrificed, slaughtered, for the sake of an idea, whether a good one or a bad one.","The concert is a polite form of self induced torture.","Our own physical body possesses a wisdom which we who inhabit the body lack. We give it orders which make no sense.","Actors die so loud.","I have never been able to look upon America as young and vital but rather as prematurely old, as a fruit which rotted before it had a chance to ripen.","I see America spreading disaster. I see America as a black curse upon the world. I see a long night settling in and that mushroom which has poisoned the world withering at the roots.","Music is a beautiful opiate, if you don't take it too seriously.","Life, as it is called, is for most of us one long postponement.","The world is not to be put in order; the world is order, incarnate. It is for us to harmonize with this order.","Develop interest in life as you see it; in people, things, literature, music - the world is so rich, simply throbbing with rich treasures, beautiful souls and interesting people. Forget yourself.","Any genuine philosophy leads to action and from action back again to wonder, to the enduring fact of mystery.","The great work must inevitably be obscure, except to the very few, to those who like the author himself are initiated into the mysteries. Communication then is secondary: it is perpetuation which is important. For this only one good reader is necessary.","No matter how vast, how total, the failure of man here on earth, the work of man will be resumed elsewhere. War leaders talk of resuming operations on this front and that, but man's front embraces the whole universe.","When one is trying to do something beyond his known powers it is useless to seek the approval of friends. Friends are at their best in moments of defeat.","Plots and character don't make life. Life is here and now, anytime you say the word, anytime you let her rip.","If men cease to believe that they will one day become gods then they will surely become worms.","The real leader has no need to lead - he is content to point the way.","We should read to give our souls a chance to luxuriate.","The only thing we never get enough of is love; and the only thing we never give enough of is love.","What distinguishes the majority of men from the few is their ability to act according to their beliefs.","There is nothing strange about fear: no matter in what guise it presents itself it is something with which we are all so familiar that when a man appears who is without it we are at once enslaved by him.","What is not in the open street is false, derived, that is to say, literature.","In the beginning was the Word. Man acts it out. He is the act, not the actor.","And what is the potential man, after all? Is he not the sum of all that is human? Divine, in other words?","Instead of asking 'How much damage will the work in question bring about?' why not ask 'How much good? How much joy?'","Man has demonstrated that he is master of everything except his own nature.","What does it matter how one comes by the truth so long as one pounces upon it and lives by it?","It is the American vice, the democratic disease which expresses its tyranny by reducing everything unique to the level of the herd.","The real enemy can always be met and conquered, or won over. Real antagonism is based on love, a love which has not recognized itself.","To live without killing is a thought which could electrify the world, if men were only capable of staying awake long enough to let the idea soak in.","The worst sin that can be committed against the artist is to take him at his word, to see in his work a fulfillment instead of an horizon.","Analysis brings no curative powers in its train; it merely makes us conscious of the existence of an evil, which, oddly enough, is consciousness.","When you know what men are capable of you marvel neither at their sublimity nor their baseness. There are no limits in either direction apparently."],"Henry Mintzberg":["Companies are communities. There's a spirit of working together. Communities are not a place where a few people allow themselves to be singled out as solely responsible for success.","I describe management as arts, crafts and science. It is a practice that draws on arts, craft and science and there is a lot of craft - meaning experience - there is a certain amount of craft meaning insight, creativity and vision, and there is the use of science, technique or analysis.","You can teach all sorts of things that improve the practice of management with people who are managers. What you cannot do is teach management to somebody who is not a manager, the way you cannot teach surgery to somebody whose not a surgeon.","Managers who don't lead are quite discouraging, but leaders who don't manage don't know what's going on. It's a phony separation that people are making between the two.","If the private sectors are about markets and the public sectors are about governments, then the plural sector is about communities.","Basically, managing is about influencing action. Managing is about helping organizations and units to get things done, which means action. Sometimes, managers manage actions directly. They fight fires. They manage projects. They negotiate contracts.","What I have against M.B.A.s is the assumption that you come out of a two-year program probably never having been a manager - at least for full-time younger people M.B.A. programs - and assume you are ready to manage.","So technologies, whether it is a telephone or an iPhone, computers in general or automobiles, television even, all individualize us. We all sit in front of our iPhones and communicating but are we really communicating?","This obsession with leadership... It's not neutral; it's American, this idea of the heroic leader who comes in on a white horse to save the day. I think it's killing American companies.","My feeling about executive bonuses is that any candidate for a chief executive job who even raises the issue of bonuses should be dismissed out of hand.","Technologies tend to undermine community and encourage individualism.","Often, M.B.A.s will parachute around from one company or industry to another, without really understanding what's behind it.","What you get out of an M.B.A. programme, no matter how much experience, is functional tools and understanding in disciplines: you'll understand economics, you'll understand marketing, finance, accounting. That, M.B.A. programmes do very well.","We're all flawed, but basically, effective managers are people whose flaws are not fatal under the circumstances. Maybe the best managers are simply ordinary, healthy people who aren't too screwed up."],"Henry Moore":["Sculpture is an art of the open air. Daylight, sunlight, is necessary to it, and for me, its best setting and complement is nature.","I believe that nothing should be taboo - no theory or prejudice should close one's mind to a discovery.","The secret of life is to have a task, something you devote your entire life to, something you bring everything to, every minute of the day for the rest of your life. And the most important thing is, it must be something you cannot possibly do.","The creative habit is like a drug. The particular obsession changes, but the excitement, the thrill of your creation lasts.","There are three fundamental poses of the human figure. One is standing. The other is seated, and the third is lying down... Of the three poses, the reclining figure gives the most freedom, compositionally and spatially.","To know one thing, you must know the opposite.","Everything I do is intended to be big.","So with the young African artists. What they have to learn from tribal art is not how to copy the traditional forms, but the confidence that comes from knowing that somewhere inside them there should be the vitality which enabled their fathers to produce these extraordinary and exciting forms.","A sculptor is a person who is interested in the shape of things, a poet in words, a musician by sounds.","The hole connects one side to the other, making it immediately more three-dimensional. A hole can itself have as much shape-meaning as a solid mass.","The most striking quality common to all primitive art is its intense vitality. It is something made by a people with a direct and immediate response to life.","The violent quarrel between the abstractionists and the surrealists seems to me quite unnecessary. All good art has contained both abstract and surrealist elements, just as it has contained both classical and romantic elements - order and surprise, intellect and imagination, conscious and unconscious.","Cezanne had an enormous influence on everyone in that period; there was a change in attitudes to art. People found him disturbing because they didn't like their existing ideas being challenged and overturned. Cezanne was probably the key figure in my lifetime.","It is a mistake for a sculptor or a painter to speak or write very often about his job. It releases tension needed for his work.","I think in terms of the day's resolutions, not the years'.","Since the Gothic, European sculpture has become overgrown with moss, weeds - all sorts of surface excrescences which completely concealed shape. It has been Brancusi's special mission to get rid of this overgrowth and to make us once more shape-conscious.","In my opinion, long and intense study of the human figure is the necessary foundation for a sculptor.","There are universal shapes to which everybody is subconsciously conditioned and to which they can respond if their conscious control does not shut them off.","Discipline in art is a fundamental struggle to understand oneself, as much as to understand what one is drawing.","I have no conceit as a writer; in fact, I find it very difficult to start writing about sculpture generally & my aims in particular.","I was the seventh in the family. By the time I came along, one brother and two sisters had already become teachers, and this was the sort of path carved out for the rest of the family.","I admit clearly and frankly that early Mexican art formed my views of carving as much as anything I could do.","In Giacometti's work, the armature has once again become the life-line of the sculpture, and also, he's brought back to sculpture a nervous sensitivity which the 'pure carving' side of sculpture can lose sight of altogether.","Comparing Oceanic art generally with Negro art, it has a livelier, thin flicker, but much of it is more two-dimensional and concerned with pattern making. Yet the carvings of New Ireland have, besides their vicious kind of vitality, a unique spatial sense, a bird-in-a-cage form.","Turner - whether on canvas or paper - can create almost measurable distances of space and air - air that you can draw, in which you can work out what the section through it would be. The space he creates is not emptiness; it is filled with 'solid' atmosphere."],"Henry Morton Stanley":["The sky lovingly smiles on the earth and her children.","I had intended to have gone into Africa incognito. But the fact that a white man, even an American, was about to enter Africa was soon known all over Zanzibar.","But my estimates, for instance, based upon book information, were simply ridiculous, fanciful images of African attractions were soon dissipated, anticipated pleasures vanished, and all crude ideas began to resolve themselves into shape.","Dr. David Livingstone left the Island of Zanzibar in March, 1866.","The Europeans and Americans residing in the town of Zanzibar are either Government officials, independent merchants, or agents for a few great mercantile houses in Europe and America.","An insuperable obstacle to rapid transit in Africa is the want of carriers, and as speed was the main object of the Expedition under my command, my duty was to lessen this difficulty as much as possible."],"Henry Newbolt":["Princes of courtesy, merciful, proud and strong.","To set the cause above renown."],"Henry Norris Russell":["Just what future the Designer of the universe has provided for the souls of men I do not know, I cannot prove. But I find that the whole order of Nature confirms my confidence that, if it is not like our noblest hopes and dreams, it will transcend them.","Far from being hostile to religion is capable of rendering religion important services.","Conflict between science and religion a dangerous foe.","Not as a demonstrated natural law, but as a working hypothesis.","The need for some venture of faith still remains; one must stake one's life upon something.","For myself, if I am to stake all I have and hope to be upon anything, I will venture it upon the abounding fullness of God - upon the assurance that, as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are His ways higher than our ways, and His thoughts than our thoughts.","When immortality becomes for us no longer a matter of academic discussion, but the most vital of all questions; we shall find our comfort where so many before us have found it, in the ancient words."],"Henry Ossawa Tanner":["It seemed to me that this might be a great pageant, which would give a chance for a very interesting picture.","I believe the Negro blood counts, and counts to my advantage - though it has caused me at times a life of great humiliation and sorrow.","I will preach with my brush.","I decided on the spot that I would be an artist, and I assure you, it was no ordinary artist I had in mind.","Many of the artists who have represented Negro life have seen only the comic, ludicrous side of it, and have lacked sympathy with and appreciation for the warm big heart that dwells within such a rough exterior.","Get it - get it better or get it worse. No middle ground of compromise.","My effort has been not only to put the Biblical incident in the original setting... but at the same time give the human touch to convey to my public the reverence and elevation these subjects impart to me.","My efforts have been to not only put the Biblical incident in the original setting, but at the same time give the human touch which makes the whole world kin and which ever remains the same.","The physical characteristics of the child Jesus will always remain a point of discussion. No artist has ever produced a type, nor ever will, that has in it all that the varying minds of all time will acknowledge as complete."],"Henry Paulson":["As we work to promote greater economic opportunity for the American people, we must always remember that the American economy is deeply integrated with the global economy. That brings challenges but even greater opportunities.","Regulation needs to catch up with innovation.","One of the things I enjoy the most is fishing.","In just about every area of society, there's nothing more important than ethics.","When you look at territorial disputes, there are good arguments on any sides. I think it's important that we don't take sides on legitimacy.","I have relied on prayer for health care all of my life.","I hate good press, and I abhor bad press.","I believe that the root cause of every financial crisis, the root cause, is flawed government policies.","There is a very real danger that financial regulation will become a wolf in sheep's clothing.","I've long believed the environmental issue is an economic issue and a political issue. The three are entwined. You can't build prosperity on any basis other than a long-term basis, and you can't do that if you don't have a healthy environment.","No matter how the financial system is set up, no matter what the economic system is, as long as you have people, you're going to have financial crises; you're going to have bubbles that manifest themselves in the financial system.","Economic growth and environmental protection are not at odds. They're opposite sides of the same coin if you're looking at longer-term prosperity.","As the Indian government has embraced greater economic openness, the creativity and expertise of the Indian workforce has been unleashed onto the world economic stage.","I didn't get the charm gene.","My dad was somewhat of a naturalist and used to teach us about different birds and trees. So did a fifth grade teacher who made a lasting impact on me; to this day, I remember his lessons about counting the needles on pine trees, seeing if they are twisted or straight, and about checking the tips of oak leaves to see if they are pointed or lobed.","From the time the kids were in upper grade school and middle school, we took trips over the Christmas break to nature-focused places, such as the Okefenokee Swamp and Cumberland Island in Georgia; Costa Rica; Maho Bay campground in St. John, Virgin Islands; the llanos of Venezuela; the southern coast and highlands of Belize.","I grew up on a working farm. It was small, a hundred acres, but we had cows and pigs and chickens and sheep and a vegetable garden. I spent hours pulling weeds, hoeing, feeding the horses, cleaning out the stalls. My dad was a tough taskmaster. I always worked, but we also had fun.","As a steward of the U.S.economy and financial systems, the Treasury has helped lay the groundwork for the American economy to become a model of strength, flexibility, dynamism, resiliency. This is a system that generates growth, creates jobs and wealth, rewards initiative, and fosters innovation.","Xi Jinping is a very strong and ambitious leader who is looking to make a lot of changes in China. He is not looking to follow a Western model based on universal suffrage. That is for sure.","Predators, they're the best coal miners' canary. When they're gone, you've got a sick ecosystem.","Size is the enemy of excellence in investment banking, particularly when you are trying to put together two different cultures.","Prime Minister Singh is to be commended for beginning the process of transforming India into a global economic power by initiating economic liberalization in the early 1990s.","India is a vibrant nation whose strength lies in its commitment to equal rights and to speech, religious and economic freedoms that enrich the lives of all citizens. India is not only the world's largest democracy; it is also a secular, pluralistic society committed to inclusive growth.","When you have a big, ugly problem, there's never going to be a neat, elegant solution that is totally painless or without a cost.","The Treasury Department has a critical role to play in helping to set the direction of a U.S. and global economy, a role that reaches back to America's founding.","When you run a company, you want to hand it off in better shape than you found it. In the same way, just as we shouldn't leave our children or grandchildren with mountains of national debt and unsustainable entitlement programs, we shouldn't leave them with the economic and environmental costs of climate change.","I've got to say our banking system is a safe and a sound one. And since the days when we've had federal deposit insurance in place, we haven't had a depositor who's got less than $100,000 in an account lose a penny. So the American people can be very, very confident about their accounts in our banking system.","I've been through periods of stress, turbulence in the market for over the course of my career, various times, and never in any of those other periods have we had the advantage of a strong economy underpinning the markets.","In China, export lobbies have fought for policies that favor their interests and limit foreign competition.","Buying a home today is a complex process, but that in no way excuses home buyers from their obligation for due diligence.","I have always tried to live by the philosophy that when there is a big problem that needs fixing, you should run towards it, rather than away from it.","In pursuing economic growth, India and the United States share similar values and similar challenges. We understand that the global economy is here to stay. To keep growing and leading the world in innovation and opportunity, the United States and India must trade freely, openly, and according to the principles of the global marketplace.","My focus is on the financial sector, on getting credit going, getting lending flowing. I can't imagine anything that would have a bigger stimulative impact.","The financial security of all Americans - their retirement savings, their home values, their ability to borrow for college, and opportunities for more and higher-paying jobs - depends on our ability to restore our financial institutions to sound footing.","In all my life, I've been trained that when there's a big problem, you run toward it.","I can't help but think what would have happened if a divisive character such as Trump were president during the 2008 financial crisis, at a time when leadership, compromise, and careful analysis were critical.","I'm a straightforward person. I like to be direct with people.","When you're boiling in oil, in the middle of a crisis, the challenges are so consuming there is no time for anything else.","The Chinese have done some extraordinary things in terms of the investments they've made in alternative sources of energy.","I think all governments engage in intelligence gathering vis-a-vis other governments.","What I've said repeatedly is, 'I think the auto industry is a very important industry.'","I always told people in the private sector, 'You can be the smartest person in the world, you can have the very best ideas, but if you can't sell them and you can't get other people to work with you, you're not going to succeed.'","As I talk with the Chinese on currency, I encourage them to move much more quickly with opening up their capital markets to competition, because I don't believe the world is going to give them as much time as they would like.","China needs a currency that reflects underlying economic fundamentals.","Illiquid asset purchases are all about capital and encouraging private capital to come in.","India is one of the world's largest and most peaceful states with advanced nuclear technologies and has been isolated from the rest of the world on nuclear issues.","For decades, Indians have immigrated to the United States, joined our communities, and raised their families while maintaining their cultural heritage.","Non-bank financial institutions provide credit that is essential to U.S. businesses and consumers.","The U.S. and China need to take steps - mostly individually, sometimes together - that will have the mutually beneficial effect of supporting and sustaining economic growth.","Too often, we restrict trade that would create U.S. jobs and is in our national interest.","Every global concern - economic, environmental or security-related - can be addressed more effectively when the U.S. and China work together.","Foreclosure is to no one's benefit. I've heard estimates that mortgage investors lose 40 to 50 percent on their investment if it goes into foreclosure.","If you've got a bazooka, and people know you've got it, you may not have to take it out.","I never once considered that it was appropriate to put taxpayer money on the line in resolving Lehman Brothers.","U.S. exports to China have more than quintupled since China entered the WTO and have grown more quickly than imports. In fact, China is America's fastest-growing export market.","China saves too much, produces too much, sells too much to Americans and consumes too little.","Anticompetitive practices hurt Chinese private firms nearly as much as foreign ones.","China and the U.S. are the two largest importers of oil. They are the two largest emitters of carbon.","It is the policy of the federal government to use all resources at its disposal to make our financial system stronger.","Our overriding goal in restructuring our financial architecture should be that taxpayers never again have to save a failing financial institution.","A single agency responsible for systemic risk would be accountable in a way that no regulator was in the run-up to the 2008 crisis. With access to all necessary information to monitor the markets, this regulator would have a better chance of identifying and limiting the impact of future speculative bubbles.","My preference is for the Federal Reserve to be the systemic risk regulator, because the responsibility for identifying and limiting potential problems is a natural complement to its role in monetary policy.","A Fed loan to Lehman Brothers would not have prevented a bankruptcy.","When our markets work, people throughout our economy benefit - Americans seeking to buy a car or buy a home, families borrowing to pay for college, innovators borrowing on the strength of a good idea for a new product or technology, and businesses financing investments that create new jobs.","One of the most constant aspects of American life is change - and nowhere is it more evident than in our financial markets.","Payment systems are critically important for overall market stability. On a typical business day, U.S. payment and settlement systems settle transactions valued at over $13 trillion.","A state-based regulatory system is quite burdensome. It allows price controls to create market distortions. It can hinder development of national products and can directly impact the competitiveness of U.S. insurers.","As Americans, we shouldn't like bailouts. Where I come from, if someone takes a risk and they're going to make the profit from that risk, they shouldn't have the taxpayer pay for the losses.","If the financial system collapses, it's really, really hard to put it back together again.","When the economy is growing, there's a lot that can be done to deal with the deficit.","We've had crooks from the beginning of time... it's always very interesting and troubling why good people do bad things.","In the past, if a homeowner with a mortgage had a problem making the payment, often he'd get together with a lender and strike a deal, because foreclosures are very expensive to the lender and obviously not good for the homeowner and the community.","I've always said, 'I don't want to be irrelevant.'","I've never been antiregulation. I've always believed that raw, unregulated capitalism doesn't work.","An open, competitive, and liberalized financial market can effectively allocate scarce resources in a manner that promotes stability and prosperity far better than governmental intervention.","As a Christian Scientist, I don't go to doctors and get diagnoses.","From the beginning of time, we've had financial crises. People always blame the banks and for good reason. When you look for the root causes, they're almost always failed government policies.","For market discipline to constrain risk effectively, financial institutions must be allowed to fail. Under optimal financial regulatory and financial system infrastructures, such a failure would not threaten the overall system.","I'm telling you that there is no silver bullet to keep home prices from going down or to prevent all foreclosures.","The most pressing and significant problems in the global economy are unsustainable structural issues with regard to the E.U. - fiscal deficits and the structure of the E.U. itself.","Many of the Western democracies - including the U.S. - have a problem that voters want benefits they don't want to pay for.","As long as I can remember, I had a strong interest in fishing, and my parents, even though they had never fished or camped, took us on canoe camping trips in the wilderness of Quetico Provincial Park in Ontario, Canada, where I could fish to my heart's content.","In my experience, the most effective professionals in business and government have the ability to get things done. They're trained to work with multiple stakeholders, to understand how to identify a problem, devise solutions, to compromise and work well with others.","I grew up with a strong set of values - and one was never judging someone by how much money they had.","I never cared about money. When I was at school, I never wanted a car. I was focused on sports, studies, camping, being outdoors.","I prefer to work at the policy level, on trying to fix flawed government policies.","We have institutions that have been allowed to become too big to fail because we had all kinds of flaws in our financial infrastructure, in the whole way over-the-counter derivatives work.","We don't have the necessary laws or powers to deal with failing non-bank institutions. If they're a big bank, the depositor has deposit insurance, and the regulators can wind them down without throwing them into bankruptcy.","Every American business, from the biggest companies to small hardware companies, need money to flow through the system not only to create new jobs but to sustain existing jobs.","I hope to help the Indian government advance their economic reform agenda, which will benefit India's citizens and the world.","Indian-Americans are physicians, engineers, CEOs, professors, teachers, entrepreneurs. They are a vital part of the United States' economic and social fabric. Because of this long history, the bonds among our people and our cultures will remain strong.","I was secretary of the Treasury in 2008. In that role, I had the privilege to work with many talented men and women in government and the private sector who labored to pull our nation back from the brink of disaster.","An AIG failure would have been devastating to the financial system and to the economy.","Taxpayer money should not have to be spent to save a misguided and mismanaged enterprise.","Large financial institutions in this country will always play a role that is essential to our economic growth. But they must only be permitted to grow and interconnect, throughout our economy, under careful oversight and with a mechanism for allowing those connections to be broken safely.","I will never apologize for changing the approach or strategy when the facts change.","America is the land of opportunity. We need to be vigilant in ensuring that each and every American has the opportunity to acquire the skills to compete and to see those skills rewarded in the marketplace.","When the financial system works as it should, money and capital flow to and from households and businesses to pay for home loans, school loans, and investments to create jobs.","What began as a subprime lending problem has spread to other, less risky mortgages and contributed to excess home inventories that have pushed down home prices for responsible homeowners.","To restore confidence in our markets and our financial institutions so they can fuel continued growth and prosperity, we must address the underlying problem. The federal government must implement a program to remove these illiquid assets that are weighing down our financial institutions and threatening our economy.","We must limit the perception that some institutions are either too big or too interconnected to fail.","The Fed has neither the clear statutory authority nor the mandate to anticipate and deal with risks across our entire financial system.","I happen to think that global slowdown, the slowdown in investment, strengthening dollar probably provide more of a headwind than we get from the decline in oil prices.","The income disparity is a huge issue. And I think that the only solution to this - there is no easy solution - are fundamental changes. That the world is changing quicker than our policies are changing. And we need the kinds of policies that will let us have a competitive economy going forward.","We need a new tax system. We need entitlement reform. We need immigration reform. These are not easy things. But it is going to take our political system working better.","The country is polarized. And I think part of it - it is not just social media. We get our facts from different places. People self-select with so many different cable channels and so many sources. I think that is a huge problem.","Complexity and interconnectedness matter as much as size in assessing risk in banking.","No bank should be too big or too complex to fail, but almost any bank is too big to liquidate quickly, particularly in the midst of a crisis.","It's hard to punish and save the banks at the same time.","When companies fail, shareholders bear the losses. It's just the way our system is supposed to work.","I've always said to everyone that ever worked for me, if you get too dug in on a position, the facts change, and you don't change to adapt to the facts, you will never be successful.","I don't take lightly ever putting the taxpayer on the line to support an institution.","There is a time for weighing evidence and a time for acting. And if there's one thing I've learned throughout my work in finance, government, and conservation, it is to act before problems become too big to manage.","I was secretary of the Treasury when the credit bubble burst, so I think it's fair to say that I know a little bit about risk, assessing outcomes, and problem-solving.","When I worry about risks, I worry about the biggest ones, particularly those that are difficult to predict - the ones I call small but deep holes. While odds are you will avoid them, if you do fall in one, it's a long way down and nearly impossible to claw your way out.","There is big resistance from vested interests in China that don't want to open up to competition.","I do not believe the United States and the Americans are going to let Donald Trump become president... I think the challenge is Donald Trump, with his anti-China rhetoric and with his anti-trade rhetoric, is going to make the job for all of us more difficult going forward.","I look forward to the day when China has a truly market-determined solution... To get there, you need to have a currency that is market-determined, an open capital market, and you are going to need a competitive, open financial system.","I think it is asking a lot for regulators to be perfect - because they won't be.","If a financial institution has business operations in the United States, hires people in the United States, if they are clogged with illiquid assets, they have the same impact on the American people as any other institution.","There's a great lack of financial literacy and understanding in this nation, even among college-educated people.","The idea of being Treasury secretary in the abstract appealed to me, but my initial inclination was that it wasn't right for me to take that step.","I see nothing easy in Washington. I see either analytically simple things that are politically complex or those that are politically complex and analytically complex. I mean, look at immigration reform, you know? It is, I think, analytically easy, but politically very, very complex and very difficult.","Moral hazard is something I don't take lightly.","Until we stem the housing correction, until the biggest part of that is behind us and we have more stability in housing prices, we're going to continue to have turmoil in the financial markets.","I want to remind you of one thing, which is, when I look around the world and look at the long-term economic fundamentals we have in this country, I think they compare favorably with what I see in any major developed country in the world.","Foreclosures are a significant problem; they're an economic problem.","I think history shows that countries have to have some kind of a threshold level of economic success before they begin to have the means and the will to focus on the environment.","Every good businessman or woman carefully analyzes all the available facts before making a decision.","After I left Treasury, I think in some ways it was harder to sit there and be writing my book... listening to all the criticism.","I grew up on a farm - I know the smell of horse manure. It does smell better than pig manure.","Sovereign wealth fund money should be welcomed. The only way not to welcome that money is when it's politically driven.","I know the automakers are important to the United States. We care about the automobile industry.","I supported some very, very objectionable things in terms of bailouts or rescues, but I did it not for Wall Street, but for the American people.","It's better to have the taxpayer pay for the losses than have the United States of America become an economic wasteland. If the financial system collapses, it's really, really hard to put it back together again.","China's growth and stability is a vital issue for all nations.","As our relationship with China grows and matures, tensions will naturally emerge.","Frankly I'm a bit concerned when it comes to U.S.-China relations.","When I left the Treasury, there was a poll that showed - and I don't remember the numbers exactly right - something like 90% of the people were against TARP. It prevented a disaster, but you don't get credit for a disaster that people don't see.","I am suspicious of career engineers, people that plan it out every step of the way.","I don't know anyone that says, 'Boy, I had a great career, and I'm happy because I screwed up my life outside of my career, my family life.' There's no one that feels that way.","If the only way you can do well is working more hours than someone else, you're going to lose out because there's always going to be someone who is going to work more.","When it comes to the presidency, I will not vote for Donald Trump.","Simply put, a Trump presidency is unthinkable.","I'll be voting for Hillary Clinton, with the hope that she can bring Americans together to do the things necessary to strengthen our economy, our environment, and our place in the world.","Let's not forget, what TARP did allowed us to move overnight and put capital into hundreds of banks, and that money came back plus $32 billion.","China has a more assertive, proactive foreign policy as its interests are growing around the world.","I think the Chinese are wise. After all, they know the U.S. is in a very different league than Russia. The U.S. is the major power in the world, and the US-China relationship... is very important to global stability, to sustain global economic growth.","I believe some of the tensions the U.S. has had with Russia and that the Europeans have had with Russia... China is taking advantage of some of those dealings.","All of us would like to have our children and their grandchildren grow up with at least the level of prosperity that we had. In the U.S., we seem to be very selfish because the older generation is not making the sacrifices.","A study by Treasury economists estimated that a country with a tax rate one percentage point lower than another country's attracts 3 percent more capital. It's not surprising then, that average OECD corporate tax rates have trended steadily downward.","It is important that China stop its over-reliance on municipal debt to finance infrastructure. I take comfort in the fact that China's leaders understand this.","I'd have liked to have been another Faulkner, of course.","I would come to New York, work, and then get out of New York. I didn't go out to dinner with other people on the Management Committee. I didn't socialize. I didn't politick.","The cheapest and cleanest energy is the energy you don't use.","If AIG collapsed, it would have buckled our financial system and wrought economic havoc on the lives of millions of our citizens."],"Henry Petroski":["Science is about knowing; engineering is about doing.","Everything we do is designed, whether we're producing a magazine, a website, or a bridge. Design is really the creative invention that designs everything.","As engineers, we were going to be in a position to change the world - not just study it.","Successful design is not the achievement of perfection but the minimization and accommodation of imperfection.","Successful engineering is all about understanding how things break or fail.","It has been said, by engineers themselves, that given enough money, they can accomplish virtually anything: send men to the moon, dig a tunnel under the English Channel. There's no reason they couldn't likewise devise ways to protect infrastructure from the worst hurricanes, earthquakes and other calamities, natural and manmade.","We call the fates of the Titanic and the Concordia - as well as those of the space shuttles Challenger and Columbia - 'accidents.' Foreseeing such undesirable events is what engineers are expected to do. However, design trade-offs leave technological systems open to failings once predicted, but later forgotten.","Failures are much more dramatic than successes, and people like drama. I think this is why automobile races draw such crowds. People expect spectacular crashes, which we tend to find more interesting than cars just racing around the track. The same is true of bridges, buildings, or any structure or machine.","Engineering is achieving function while avoiding failure.","We can't simply blame the engineers when things go wrong because, no matter how well they plan, things don't always go according to plan.","I was always told that I was good in mathematics, and I guess my grades and standardized test scores supported that. My worst subjects were those that generally involved a lot of reading - English and history. So, having good test scores in math and mediocre ones in reading, I was naturally advised to major in engineering in college.","The same aspirations to celebrate and uplift the spirit that drove the Egyptians to build the pyramids are still driving us. The things we're doing differ only in magnitude.","Although engineers want always to make everything better, they cannot make anything perfect. This basic characteristic flaw of the products of the profession's practitioners is what drives change and makes achievement a process rather than simply a goal.","Failure is central to engineering. Every single calculation that an engineer makes is a failure calculation. Successful engineering is all about understanding how things break or fail.","Relying on nothing but scientific knowledge to produce an engineering solution is to invite frustration at best and failure at worst.","The definition of 'safe' is not strictly an engineering term; it's a societal term. Does it mean absolutely no loss of life? Does it mean absolutely no contamination with radiation? What exactly does 'safe' mean?","Typically, highway bridges have about 50 years. But over in England, they have iron bridges approaching 250 years. In France, there are Roman aqueducts that are approaching 2,000 years old. So a bridge can last a very long time if it's built properly in the first place and then maintained properly.","It seems to be a law of design that for every advantage introduced through redesign, there is an accompanying unintended disadvantage.","An over-reliance on past successes is a sure blueprint for future failures.","Many new technologies come with a promise to change the world, but the world refuses to cooperate.","You can almost say that a design error is a human error because, after all, it's we humans who do the designing.","The paradox is that when we model future designs on past successes, we are inviting failure down the line; when we take into account past failures and anticipate potential new ways in which failure can occur, we are more likely to produce successful designs.","Indeed, an engineer designing a structure is not unlike an artist painting one. Both start with nothing but talent, experience, and inspiration. The fresh piece of paper on the drawing board is as blank as the newly stretched piece of canvas.","It is really want, rather than need, that drives the process of technological evolution.","Design is nothing if not decision making.","Many of the familiar little things that we use every day have typically evolved over a period of time to a state of familiarity. They balance form and function, elegance and economy, success and failure in ways that are not only acceptable, but also admirable.","Too much redesign has to do more with fad and fashion than with fitness and function. It is change for the sake of change. Such redesign is not only unnecessary, it is all too often also retrogressive, leading to things that work less effectively than those they were designed to replace.","I emphasize that virtually every engineering calculation is ultimately a failure calculation, because without a failure criterion against which to measure the calculated result, it is a meaningless number.","All conventional wisdom has an element of truth to it, but good design requires more than an element of truth - it requires an ensemble of correct assumptions and valid calculations.","I employ case studies of failure into my courses, emphasizing that they teach us much more than studies of success. It is not that success stories cannot serve as models of good design or as exemplars of creative engineering. They can do that, but they cannot teach us how close to failure they are.","Case studies of failure should be made a part of the vocabulary of every engineer so that he or she can recall or recite them when something in a new design or design process is suggestive of what went wrong in the case study.","Any design, whether it's for a ship or an airplane, must be done in anticipation of potential failures.","There's so much written about the Titanic, and it's hard to separate what's fact and what's fiction. My understanding is that the way the Titanic was designed, the emphasis was placed on surviving a head-on collision.","I have always been fascinated by the way things work and how they came to take the form that they did. Writing about these things satisfies my curiosity about the made world while at the same time giving me an opportunity to design a new explanation for the processes that shape it.","I relax by looking at things and reading about things. Even the simplest thing can reveal a great deal about the world around us. It relaxes me greatly to sit back with my feet up and look around my study at the everyday things that surround me.","I'm a firm believer that no matter how small an object is, you can find interesting things out about it and its history.","Read and write with a sensitive ear. The craft of writing is very important. Practice the craft.","Companies selling a product play down its vulnerability and emphasize its robustness. But only after technology leaves the dock is it really tested. For human operators in control of a supposedly infallible system, complacency and overconfidence can take over, and caution may be thrown to the wind.","For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated by things large and small. I wanted to know what made my watch tick, my radio play, and my house stand. I wanted to know who invented the bottle cap and who designed the bridge. I guess from early on I wanted to be an engineer.","My first book, 'To Engineer Is Human,' was prompted by nonengineer friends asking me why so many technological accidents and failures were occurring. If engineers knew what they were doing, why did bridges and buildings fall down? It was a question that I had often asked myself, and I had no easy answer.","As long as there are things to wonder about, there are stories to be written about them. That makes me happy, because writing about things seems to be my thing.","If I could go upstairs and write every day, I would be happy. I don't need recreation.","Luxury, not necessity, is the mother of invention. Every artifact is somewhat wanting in its function, and that is what drives its evolution.","No design, no matter how common or seemingly insignificant, is without its adamant critics as well as its ardent admirers.","Because every design must satisfy competing objectives, there necessarily has to be compromise among, if not the complete exclusion of, some of those objectives, in order to meet what are considered the more important of them.","The space shuttle was designed, at least in part, to broaden our knowledge of the universe. To scientists, the vehicle was a tool; to engineers, it was their creation.","A common misconception about how things such as space shuttles come to be is that engineers simply apply the theories and equations of science. But this cannot be done until the new thing-to-be is conceived in the engineer's mind's eye. Rather than following from science, engineered things lead it.","Because they are so humbled by their creations, engineers are naturally conservative in their expectations of technology. They know that the perfect system is the stuff of science fiction, not of engineering fact, and so everything must be treated with respect.","Betting on the success of innovative technologies in the marketplace can carry all the uncertainty and risk that betting on the next card in the deck does at a blackjack table in Las Vegas. There is a factor of randomness that must be factored in, but precisely how to do so is anyone's guess."],"Henry R. Luce":["Business, more than any other occupation, is a continual dealing with the future; it is a continual calculation, an instinctive exercise in foresight.","Show me a man who claims he is objective and I'll show you a man with illusions.","Time should make enemies and Life should make friends.","Publishing is a business, but journalism never was and is not essentially a business. Nor is it a profession.","I suggest that what we want to do is not to leave to posterity a great institution, but to leave behind a great tradition of journalism ably practiced in our time.","I became a journalist to come as close as possible to the heart of the world.","To see, and to show, is the mission now undertaken by Life.","There are men who can write poetry, and there are men who can read balance sheets. The men who can read balance sheets cannot write."],"Henry Reed":["When we fall asleep, we withdraw our awareness from its hypnotic fascination with physical sensation, thereby enabling us to listen with our now awakening sixth sense.","What we hear while we are asleep continues to resonate with us upon awakening.","The sixth sense is at the core of our experiences. It is what makes experiences out of events.","How do you know, right now, that you are aware of being aware, or conscious?","People don't think their dreams amount to much, but when I ask them to examine them for common themes, they surprise themselves at how accurate they are! They see that their dreams have value.","We each have a sixth sense that is attuned to the oneness dimension in life, providing a means for us to guide our lives in accord with our ideas.","Dream study impacts culture. We are put in touch with the inner poet who dreams. We hear our inner, subjective response to the outer world. That helps spiritualize our lives.","All human beings are interconnected, one with all other elements in creation.","As we abide in sleep, intuitively resonating with the sum of all our experiences - this life and beyond - we gain refreshing perspective on our efforts and have an opportunity to remember what we know.","Because there is a larger awareness that transcends time and space, an awareness is available after death.","Dreams have always expanded our understanding of reality by challenging our boundaries of the real, of the possible.","Dreams seem to have a will of their own.","Freud published The Interpretation of Dreams in 1900. It introduced the notion that there existed certain predictable and identifiable processes by which dreams were formed.","Hugh Lynn Cayce, Edgar Cayce's son, is quoted as saying, The best interpretation of a dream is one you apply.","I published in 1978 a report on dreams in the Journal of Clinical Psychology. It was the first study of its kind to demonstrate that it is possible for people to make constructive use of their dreams to improve their lives.","If there is any one truth from the legacy of the Cayce readings, it would be that there is a spiritual dimension to humans, something beyond time and space.","If there is any truth to my parenting the dreamwork movement, it comes from the power of the press.","Intuition is the very force or activity of the soul in its experience through whatever has been the experience of the soul itself.","It is easier to learn to interpret dreams if you have a reason to use them for something constructive. You apply your dream insights to making constructive changes in your life.","It makes a difference what we choose to experience during sleep. Many of us think of sleep as a chance to get away from it all. But sleep is also a chance to return to the joys of our spiritual heritage - our universal awareness.","It was Jung who first said to explain the symbol as if talking to a man from mars who knew nothing about our life on earth.","People are learning to feel more comfortable hearing one another's dreams. It used to be that if you told a dream in public, someone had to make a joke to relieve the tension introduced by that alternative reality.","The things that concern us during the day are going to influence what we experience during the night.","The usual comment from psychologists and psychiatrists was that it's best not to encourage people to look at their dreams because they are liable to stir up problems for themselves.","There is both a skill factor and an effort factor in dream recall. People can develop dream recall skills, such as lying still in the morning and writing down whatever comes to mind.","There is something very basic to the sense of listening. The sense of hearing is the only one that operates totally from vibrations, without other physical or chemical reactions to receive the sensations.","What is it like to fall asleep? What happens? Where do we go? Why don't we remember? Since childhood most of us have wondered about the mystery of sleep.","When we awaken, we cannot account for the time spent. We simply don't remember. About the only evidence we have of experiences while we were asleep is when we happen to remember a dream."],"Henry Rollins":["Loneliness adds beauty to life. It puts a special burn on sunsets and makes night air smell better.","It's sad when someone you know becomes someone you knew.","We all learn lessons in life. Some stick, some don't. I have always learned more from rejection and failure than from acceptance and success.","Pizza makes me think that anything is possible.","Weakness is what brings ignorance, cheapness, racism, homophobia, desperation, cruelty, brutality, all these things that will keep a society chained to the ground, one foot nailed to the floor.","Scar tissue is stronger than regular tissue. Realize the strength, move on.","I am on until I am dead, like a light bulb.","Yes, I guess you could say I am a loner, but I feel more lonely in a crowed room with boring people than I feel on my own.","You need a little bit of insanity to do great things.","My optimism wears heavy boots and is loud.","Don't do anything by half. If you love someone, love them with all your soul. When you go to work, work your ass off. When you hate someone, hate them until it hurts.","We know that in September, we will wander through the warm winds of summer's wreckage. We will welcome summer's ghost.","I think that humans have a huge capacity to carry pain and sadness. There are things that haunt us our entire lives; we are unable to let them go. The good times seem almost effervescent and dreamlike in comparison with the times that didn't go so well.","Musicians should not play music. Music should play musicians.","In winter, I plot and plan. In spring, I move.","Keep your blood clean, your body lean, and your mind sharp.","If I lose the light of the sun, I will write by candlelight, moonlight, no light, If I lose paper and ink, I will write in blood on forgotten walls. I will write always. I will capture nights all over the world and bring them to you.","Where there is young people and vitality, you're going to find punk rock.","Live music is the cure for what ails ya.","Creating problems is easy. We do it all the time. Finding solutions, ones that last and produce good results, requires guts and care.","Consumerism is at once the engine of America and simultaneously one of the most revealing indicators of our collective shallowness.","I don't think you'll ever have a perfect world because we humans are prone to error, and so we're always in search of an upgrade.","My motto is, 'Never quit.'","I just travel the world with my backpack and my cameras and a bunch of Clif bars.","There's a lot of mountain climbers trapped inside of bodies of people behind the counter at Kinko's.","Questioning anything and everything, to me, is punk rock.","Now and then, someone is able to look at an empty space, conclude it would be a great place to start a revolution, and bravely go forward.","I'm not interested in censorship. I like the First Amendment very much.","It's one thing to buy a copy of 'Atlas Shrugged.' You actually have to read it to get anything out of it.","Early spring is the time for vigorous change, a preparation for the heat-driven oppression that is to come.","I would like to become a better photographer. I'm working on that.","Now, if someone wants to spit on me, I just roll up the window of my BMW 540i.","The kid who throws his spaghetti from the high chair onto his father's face, he's pushing back. He's sticking it to the man as he sees it. I like that. So that is punk.","South Sudan is one of the most hard-put places in the world.","Being unique is never easy, and often, by the time culture catches up with you, there are only a few people who notice.","You want to meet a bunch of really friendly people? Go to a Slayer concert. There'll be some real psychos there, but most of those people will take care of each other.","Voting is completely important. People in America think democracy is a given. I think of it as an ecosystem, and what gets in the way of it is politicians and apathy.","I'm a big fan of the American Tapes label. But that's very hard to keep a grip on that because you blink your eyes and they've released three records, all of which are limited edition, all sold at one show. So you have to follow in drips and drops on eBay, which I do.","The truth is an anti-war statement in itself.","In the city of Pyongyang, you don't have to look very far to see an image of the Great Leader, Kim Il Sung. They love the guy. He is responsible for the wonder that is North Korea.","Adolescence is a plague on the senses.","I don't believe in fate or destiny. I believe in various degrees of hatred, paranoia, and abandonment. However much of that gets heaped upon you doesn't matter - it's only a matter of how much you can take and what it does to you.","Some people see Black Friday as a much-needed break for their wallet. I see it as retail outlets showing the customers the full weight of their contempt. The frenzy to buy cheap crap from China, the human downgrade of people fighting with each other over items they can probably live without, to me, is an insult.","Do you know why Albert Camus was so prolific? He wrote to keep from screaming.","It is amazing to hear grown-up people rationalize homophobia and discrimination. The lengths they go to trying to prove their points take reason to its breaking point.","I always start tours with a great deal of anticipation.","Most of the people who call me a sellout were 7 when I was down face-first in the punk trenches.","I wasn't playing the music, the music was playing me... and once that went away, and I had the feeling I was playing music, I had to stop. The need to go onstage and get my brain flattened every night left me, and what I didn't wanna do is go onstage and perpetrate a fraud... You cannot fool an audience.","I don't know if music has ever achieved anything past appealing to the people that it appeals to. If a song could stop a war, then Bob Marley and Bob Dylan songs would have stopped one or two.","To our enemies all over the world who plan America's demise, please take my advice. Give up now. No matter what, you will lose. You will lose it all.","Death metal uses a lot of white face paint and black hair dye to make its point. I quite enjoy this genre for its intensity, extremism and underlying irony: You have to be alive to play it and listen to it.","If people are being upstanding citizens of the Republic, then you have to widen the net to incarcerate them. This explains why America's prisons are full of nonviolent offenders - a perfect example of American exceptionalism.","But I have a good life. I enjoy what I do. I am married to work.","A text conversation is a short exchange of often grossly truncated language that corresponds to a thought made all the more shallow by the process.","I would like go to Palestine and interview people there about what their lives are like; same thing in Iran.","There is no place in the world like Australia. Not even its beautiful neighbor New Zealand.","I believe that one defines oneself by reinvention. To not be like your parents. To not be like your friends. To be yourself. To cut yourself out of stone.","So I'm more at home with my backpack, sleeping in a hotel room or on a bus or on an airplane, than I am necessarily on a bed. It's weird being here. It feels like I'm standing next to my real life.","Life will not break your heart. It'll crush it.","August, the summer's last messenger of misery, is a hollow actor.","I have come to the conclusion that it's a waste of time to have too much pride in anything. Perhaps it's good to have a sense of duty, a jealous zeal to protect or improve, but pride ultimately is only that which stands vulnerable to offense and degradation.","When you hear about what someone else is going through, and you are unable to distance yourself from it or in any way muzzle your empathy and are inspired to actually do something, these are moments to learn from.","The ecstatic insanity of romantic pursuit can be so enhanced by music that entire romantic conquests, victories and ruinous, crushing defeats can be tied to songs to such a degree that it's almost unbearable to listen to them again, as they bring back the memories so vividly.","To this day, my haircut is the number two clippers, which I apply to myself every month.","When you're going into an employment environment that looks pretty scary, it is easy to lose your moral compass, your decency, your sense of civility and your sense of community.","Maybe I'm just a psycho, and the stage is a better place to go than either the loony bin or somewhere else.","The public library system of the United States is worth preserving.","One person's roar is another's whine, just as one person's music is another's unendurable noise.","The perpetrators of the actual bad stuff that does real and lasting harm to people, like leakage of industrial chemicals into water systems, seem to get not so much as a second glance; the bloviation from media pundits and think tanks creates false problems that waste time and energy debunking.","The first several years of my life were used to upload incredible amounts of fear, and I just became afraid of everything. I was afraid of my parents, afraid of my classmates, afraid of the streets of Washington, D.C. I would flinch at every gesture.","Russia is tough. The history, the land, the people - brutal.","Michele Bachmann is always a great person to go to for an opinion about anything. She has a very active and interesting mind.","I think it is incumbent on anyone who can to lift human dignity to the highest possible levels, maintaining one's own and helping to raise that of others.","There's tons of junk food for your mind on the Internet. You can sit there for three or 10 or 20 hours a day getting in online arguments with other people who also choose to waste their time.","'Fox News' will one day come to an end. Led Zeppelin will not. It's as simple as that.","Mr. Christ, I read you as an infinitely patient entity who, as they say, often works in mysterious ways, a rebel unafraid to take the tougher, less traveled paths. Seems to me you're playing the long game. Is that why more states are coming out in favor of marriage equality? Is that why the Affordable Care Act is now with us?","Airports in major cities, like LAX, are trippy environments. It is at once a national and international gathering of those in transition: The euphoric, emerging from planes, their journey at an end, and the determined, about to depart.","Smart people make good choices. They dig science and say 'no' to the invasion of sovereign nations for the pleasure of corporations.","I spend several days at a time without enough sleep. At first, normal activities become annoying. When you are too tired to eat, you really need some sleep. A few days later, things become strange. Loud noises become louder and more startling, familiar sounds become unfamiliar, and life reinvents itself as a surrealist dream.","When you start to doubt yourself the real world will eat you alive.","Everything I do, writing, touring, travelling, it all comes from the punk and hardcore attitude, from that expression - from being open to try things but relying on yourself, taking what you have into the battle and making of it what you will, hoping you can figure it out as you go. Make some sense of it.","Spring and fall, those are very inspiring times of the year for me.","I love capitalism. It rewards me for being brave - it awards me for being innovative and thinking out of the box.","I think more tolerance, more people having more access to a chance to be literate, and a chance to stay healthy makes for a more peaceful planet.","I am an employment hyena. I am happy to make a meal of what the lions leave behind.","Literally thousands of lawsuits have been filed against the NFL by retired players, many of whom say that information on brain injury in football was withheld from them.","To see change in your own area code is very powerful. There's a little orphanage down the street from my company, and we donate $1 from the sale of each CD we sell to the orphanage.","The prison-industrial complex and the military-industrial complex are here with us and are multi-billion dollar enterprises. We can make more money off the kid in Compton if he's a criminal instead of a scholar. It's business.","I'm not in a position where I get to pick and choose roles. I usually go on auditions in long lines and embarrass myself in front of casting directors, and with a lump in my throat and my ears burning, I walk past reception and smirking actors as I go to the parking garage and go back on the highway.","When I'm off the road, and I can really control my diet down to the calorie, I juice seven days a week. Every afternoon, whatever I have at hand, beets, carrots, ginger, whatever. I juice, literally, every single day. And on the road, I try to find fresh juice wherever I can.","To me, the real 'state of the union' is found in how Americans react to current events.","Humans are pretty crafty but will fold quickly in severe cold.","It is only our humanity that can deliver us from the brutality of our achievements.","For me, jazz will always be the soundtrack of the civil rights movement.","I don't mind bees and think we are all the better for having them around. I like the taste of honey.","It took me until my teenage years to realize that I was medicating with music. I was pushing back against my stupid school uniform, instructors who called me by my last name and my classmates, who, while friendly enough, were not at all inspiring.","I've made some great mistakes in my life, but, you know, they were honest mistakes.","In the summer of 1991, I was on the first Lollapalooza tour. Nightly, I would watch Jane's Addiction singer Perry Farrell go out in front of a sea of people and within minutes have all of them in the palm of his hand. I have never seen anything like it since.","I have come to regard November as the older, harder man's October. I appreciate the early darkness and cooler temperatures. It puts my mind in a different place than October. It is a month for a quieter, slightly more subdued celebration of summer's death as winter tightens its grip.","Why do you think the old stories tell of men who set out on great journeys to impress the gods? Because trying to impress people just isn't worth the time and effort.","Every year, August lashes out in volcanic fury, rising with the din of morning traffic, its great metallic wings smashing against the ground, heating the air with ever-increasing intensity.","You must never lower yourself to being a person you don't like.","I like boring black and white films with subtitles. I'm basically a drip.","The only thing about sanctions is that, like a lot of drone strikes, there are countless unintended victims. Cutting off aid to Uganda only increases the pain there.","When you have to work with and exist amongst cynical, burned-out personnel on a set, it doesn't matter what you're shooting or how much you're being paid - it's not worth it.","I tend to gravitate to the darkest or most obscure part of any venue in an effort to have my own space to experience the music on my own, free from unwanted conversations and other distractions.","I wonder what it's like to be from a state that is spread across a few islands way out in the Pacific Ocean, only added to the United States in 1959. Not only that but to be the birthplace of America's first black president? Pretty cool, I bet.","Dinosaur Jr. in their live capacity are a band that put me in a state of such overwhelming rock that it often takes quite a while to come down.","Ramones music has a Pavlovian effect on me - the song starts, and the world blurs around the sound.","I once asked Ozzy Osbourne, truly one of my favorite people in the world, if he was cool with singing Black Sabbath songs year after year, whether he was performing with Black Sabbath or out on a solo tour. He said it was great.","I am not immune to the lure of a signed record, flier or set list. The fact that your music heroes potentially had, in their own hands, the record you now have in yours is kind of cool. When the musician has departed, it can give the thing a unique power.","I can't remember that I ever had just a minute of stage fright.","I'm mellower now, I'm over 50. But I don't think I'm too mellow. I'm still angry at a lot of things.","There is a lot to say about what Bikini Kill and other 'riot grrrl' bands were able to achieve when they first set out. They were not some momentary, convulsive, creative spasm of independent music. There was a very real, relevant point of view being expressed.","We city dwellers, we residents of Los Angeles and the surrounding areas, are for the most part urbanized to some extent. We know deadlines, start times and traffic.","This is my own little rock theory: In my mind, Nirvana slayed the hair bands. They shot the top off the poodles.","Canadians are often a friendly bunch.","In blues music, there's a lot of borrowing, so it's often difficult to identify the originator of a song.","It's why real men just go out in the woods and howl. I must do it and get paid.","I am neither pro- nor anti-gun. I am gun-conscious.","More guns equaling more safety is a slippery slope, and what makes it so is human blood.","If the Constitution was a movie, the Preamble would be the trailer, the First Amendment the establishing shot, the 13th the crowd pleaser and the 14th the ultimate hero scene.","Each year, every city in the world that can should have a multiday festival. More people meeting each other, digging new types of music, new foods, new ideas. You want to stop having so many wars? This could be a step in the right direction.","Hope is the last thing a person does before they are defeated.","And I laugh at myself when I screw things up, which happens all the time.","Everyone who knows me knows that I'm a hopeless romantic who listens to love ballads and doo-wop songs all the time.","Maybe I'm ego-tripping, but I don't find myself a particularly horrible person, so I don't think I need to hold back anything I think or feel.","I think a lot of Americans have never been all that hungry. They've never had war on their shore, and they've never suffered the way other cultures have suffered. I'm not saying we should go suffer. Not at all. I'm saying we should be more aware of how other cultures exist.","Music to me is mankind's greatest possible achievement because look at all the good it does.","When someone asks you, 'What's punk?' my reply is, 'If you have to ask, you're never going to know.'","I don't have a crystal ball, but I'm willing to bet one of my arms right now that as long as there's electricity, Ramones music is going to be relevant.","I'm a professional food eater.","If you want to believe that humans walked with dinosaurs and the planet is a few thousand years old, that is absolutely fine with me. If you want to teach this to your kids, I don't care. If states want to teach creationism in their schools, there is nothing I can do about it, so I don't sweat it.","Before any American points a finger at President Putin and calls him nasty names, they should recognize that a lot of Americans agree with Putin on his stance against homosexual and transgender people.","I have had a number of less-than-enviable moments in my life when dealing with other people. I won't attempt to blunt that by saying I am not the only one.","If I had to live my life in anticipation of what others thought of me, little would get done.","Watching a documentary with people hacking their way through some polar wasteland is merely a visual. Actually trying to deal with cold that can literally kill you is quite a different thing.","As a teen, I heard the second Velvet Underground album, 'White Light/White Heat,' and it was too much for my limited scope of appreciation. It was intense, but I didn't get it.","I don't need to have my convictions confirmed by a show of numbers. However, being among people in front of a band leads me to believe that all is not lost, that humans, now and then, can communicate on a higher level than the political and the practical.","America was cool with Saddam Hussein when he was killing Iranians.","The fact is, in the minds of many, Trayvon Martin received the appropriate punishment for a true crime: He was black, male and dared to walk outside. In life, young Trayvon was just a teenager; in death, he has been transformed into a scary, lurking, suspicious, prone-to-violence spook.","George Zimmerman is a foot soldier in a rapidly privatizing country. He is a new centurion of 21st-century America. Law enforcement is tied down by the strictures of, well, the law. There is only 'so much they can do' to take care of the 'problem.'","I have to do things for myself, and if those standards are set high, then it's up to me to pass or fail.","I consider any gun that can chamber a round and send a projectile down its barrel at a high rate of speed into my body - causing me injury or death - to be an assault weapon.","We humans are hard to deal with. We are a loud, complex and demanding bunch. Often, we are best dealt with from a safe distance and for only brief periods of time. This could be why a lot of marriages fail.","Life is weird, great and dangerous.","In my bright, utopian future world, they will hand out college educations like cups of water at the end of the L.A. Marathon.","The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was vigorously and vociferously opposed by the Southern states. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed it into law nonetheless.","I know that collector types can be a pain in the neck and seem perpetually frozen in time - or at least in their parents' basement - but someone has to look out for the past, lest it slip away forever.","When I am in Africa, I realize I don't know much, have not seen much, and there's a lot to be done.","For a long time, when I was very young, I went to go see arena rock bands. I was 16, and it was all I could get in to see, legally. And I saw Led Zeppelin and Ted Nugent and Van Halen and all that.","I was in Pakistan in Islamabad when Bhutto was assassinated, and the next day, you know, there's just plumes of smoke everywhere. I mean, Islamabad is on fire.","It's not lost on me that everyone dies, but some people have a kind of immortality about them, and you can't imagine that they will ever be gone.","August brings into sharp focus and a furious boil everything I've been listening to in the late spring and summer.","In many ways, America is on the receiving end of a pendulum that has been swung with great force, and for a long time, outward into the world. The impact is a wake-up call on every level.","Change is hard, but change is good.","I'm not into fame. I'm not into making money, outside of financing my books. I'm not into status. My thing is basically about time - not wasting it.","I can only write about personal stuff, about my point of view.","When a band becomes as truly iconic as the Velvet Underground, there will often be a box set released, overburdened with mediocre material that dilutes what was fine left on its own.","America sold VX nerve gas and anthrax to Iraq for years, even after the Halabja gas attack, which killed thousands of Kurds.","When a young non-white male is stopped and searched at the whim of a police officer, his idea of personal space, privacy and self esteem are shattered, to say nothing of his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment protections. The damage goes deep quickly and stays. Stop & frisk, as well as a tactic, is also an incitement.","America is a country born from semi-mythologized blood, glory and acts of selfless patriotic sacrifice.","Jazz music is as American as it gets, and so is the U.S. Postal Service. A Miles Davis stamp is a perfect marriage of two great American institutions.","For me, Memphis has always been a city that holds a great deal of meaning and also leads me to a lot of thinking. Besides Sun Studio, which helped put rock n' roll on the map all over the world, the legendary Stax Studio also called Memphis home.","You could split hairs and bring up words like 'doo-wop' and terms like 'soul' or 'R&B', but I think pop music is what you want it to be - that's why it's pop.","Seasonal change in Los Angeles is often a very subtle thing. It's not as if we finally stop having to shovel the snow out of our driveways and can put our parkas back in the closet.","If American forces leave Afghanistan, the Taliban is going to do what to America? Don't say you're worried about what they will do to the Afghan people. If that was America's concern, America's operational presence there would be much different.","So, one way or another, I found myself in a few movies. I take it seriously when I'm on the set, but I don't take myself seriously as an actor.","I don't mind The Boss. I think he's an honest guy. I have some of his records, not all of them. I've met a couple of the E-Street guys, and they seem really cool.","In the summer of '84, you just couldn't escape the Born in the USA record.","I'm most in my element on tour, with a gig that day, like today. I'm on the road where I am supposed to be. I will be where I'm supposed to be at nighttime, on stage, in front of people, doing my thing.","This is my 25th year of being on stage. A lot of people who I kind of toed up to the starting line with are no longer in this position. I feel very, very lucky.","I just get things done instead of talking about getting them done. I don't go out and party. I don't smoke, drink or do drugs and I'm not married, that leaves a lot of time for my work.","It is just that I don't want a wife and I don't want kids.","I'm 36 and if I met a woman of my own age and married her, I'd also be marrying her former life, her past. It might be OK for some people - I don't want to judge it or anything - but it's not for me. It would destroy my creativity.","I need to do things on my own, need to be left alone.","I mean I appreciate fan mail and that the people like what I am doing but I can't answer it. If I would answer 25 letters a day I would be just a guy answering mail and not an artist anymore.","I don't mean to be arrogant and I really appreciate my fans but talking about what I am doing is not something I'm good at. I do what I do and that's it. I want to get back to my work and do more of it instead of talking about it.","I want to change things for the better, just like everybody else.","I can deal with people who watch me on stage but I am not good in communicating with people any other way than through my work.","Being an artist is dragging your innermost feelings out, giving a piece of yourself, no matter in which art form, in which medium.","As long as I tell the truth I feel that nobody can touch me.","I've always seen it as the role of an artist to drag his inside out, give the audience all you've got. Writers, actors, singers, all good artists do the same. It isn't supposed to be easy.","What I don't want to do is go out there and not be able to mean it, you know?","The only difference between me and others is that they think they can change something with cute little poems, nice cards or embracing trees and being nice to little lapdogs.","I am an optimist because I want to change things for the better and I know that blood has to be spilled and disharmony and cruelty are necessary to do that.","Giving a good performance, giving it all is what it's all about. I love to perform.","I love to go on stage and sing.","The blues is losing someone you love and not having enough money to immerse yourself in drink.","Nothing brings people together more, then mutual hatred.","Sometimes the truth hurts. And sometimes it feels real good.","To hate is to show you still care, who needs that, focus on what's really important.","I think about the meaning of pain. Pain is personal. It really belongs to the one feeling it. Probably the only thing that is your own. I like mine.","I forged myself out of a vacuum. I crawl along the highway on hacked off stumps year after year. Some wonder how and why. I never do.","I don't want to pass through life like a smooth plane ride.","I'm very boring.","There's no rule that you have to like Henry Rollins the musician or the actor.","I guess, topic to topic, you could consider me a left-leaning person.","I'm not artistic nor am I all that creative.","And I love the hate mail I get, the unsigned, misspelled letters I get telling me to go back to Russia or wherever.","I have always thought that change you can see and feel is best.","I have not the smarts or patience for political office.","I never thought about getting any tattoos removed.","I think politicians get hamstrung by the nature of politics when the private sector can really do great things.","The world's a better place since I chose music.","I know I was a generic dysfunctional child, but I think a lot of people are.","Most poets are elitist dregs more concerned with proving their skill with a dictionary than communicating ideas with impact.","I get angry about stuff, I get very emotionally intense about stuff and that's how I get it out - with books, with the band, on my own onstage, but it's always kind of a wail.","War is very sad and small life is pathetically fragile at times.","There is no way you are going to be forgiven for blowing up a village and killing a bunch of people.","If I had to perform in a comedy club I would bomb; I would be trying too hard.","I'm most comfortable on stage.","Most Americans are very cool people.","I don't want to fail the audience. I don't want to let them down.","I want to learn more about the world. It makes me want to get up and go.","I'd like to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger, 'cause I live in California and I just want to see that canned, chemical filled body in my office.","You don't have to twist my arm to work.","I mean Black Flag happened. I was lucky. I don't think I could have put together something with one percent of that oomph on my own.","I take the work seriously, just not myself in it.","I was a very repressed young person. I wasn't good at school. I didn't fit in.","After I left D.C. to join Black Flag, I felt I was in a band.","When people hold you in high esteem, it's very delicate relationship. When they meet you they're putting all their chips up. It's make or break.","When the movie comes out, what anybody thinks of it doesn't really matter to me. I don't go to the wrap party. I don't go to the premiere.","Collecting records is, for many, beyond a hobby.","The scarcity of the music not only makes the music itself enjoyable but it also gives the collector a strange sense of superiority.","I have never experienced anything like walking out onto the stage of an oversold venue and, before the first note is struck, realizing that there is not going to be enough oxygen for all of us.","Every summer, around late July and into August, I find myself in Europe, performing at any festival that will have me.","Some music really does suck!","If I hear, 'Be afraid of Tehran,' I'm like, 'I'd better go to Tehran.'","If I'm in L.A. for longer than 20 days, I'm looking for work, because I don't do vacations.","To me, getting muscular was the first thing I ever achieved by working at it, and it was a game changer for me, because it was the first time I ever had confidence.","I love being a storyteller. I love telling stories.","I think young people should travel and travel often to other countries... like I do.","I'm not exactly ambitious as much as I have a very good realization of what I am and what I am capable of.","There's always going to be a need for activism; there's always going to be a need for you and me doing the right thing, being very Lincoln-sonian in looking out for each other.","I'm not a very good writer. I'm working at it.","All my big heroes are literary, writers.","If you listen to 'The Revolution Will Not Be Televised,' by Gil Scott-Heron, that album is dripping with rage.","I don't cuss in songs. It's too easy.","As a young person, I was on the road playing music, so I was getting new environments shoved in my face whether I wanted them or not.","Anything in this culture that stands still long enough eventually becomes okay if a person can derive an income from it. Eventually, pay-per-view public execution will happen, and it will be half-time entertainment.","The best compliment I get every year is that a band will write me and say, 'We were just on tour, and we had people coming to our show saying they had never heard us before they heard us on your show.'","When you are young, there is so much ahead of you, it's like the Saharan desert. You can't even see across it.","Miles Davis would have this lineup of all these amazing musicians and one day would just say, 'We're done.' After tons of great records and tickets sold, he said, 'Now I'm going to grow my hair out and play my horn through a wah-wah pedal.' Rather than play it safe, he went on.","Rarely do I do film press because I'm so low on the food chain of the movie, and for me it's just this thing I did for four weeks before the next tour started.","I find it takes a lot of strength to endure myself.","Without an education, you won't have a future.","With any advent in technology, any technological innovation, there is the good and the bad.","I'm actually on the Twitter like all those crazy young kids are, and if I'm going to do an in-store appearance or I post something on my website, I tweet these followers, a word I don't like so much, and over 50,000 people go, like, 'Okay, I got it.'","I wonder how Colin Powell sleeps at night. I would like to have a word with him because he lied. He lied. He lied to me. He lied to my face through the camera at the U.N.","A lot of Americans don't have a passport, never will have a passport. Not only will they not travel, they don't want to travel.","I'm pessimistic. I don't think that justice always gets the right person.","I'm not harmful, just introspective. You can probably think I'm weird, but it's not harmful weird.","I'd like to talk to Sean Hannity in a controlled environment and say, 'O.K., you can't interrupt and jump up and down like a professional wrestler.'","I think Naomi Klein was very astute with her book 'Shock Doctrine.' We make money on disaster.","I think the U.K. is an amazing place and has been extremely good to me. Some of my favorite and most-listened-to bands are from England. I have met many good people there and have been in front of some of the most loyal audiences I have ever encountered.","I try to be well informed. I don't know how well I do all the time, but I try nonetheless.","The idea that any performer type is owed anything is a joke to me.","I've never heard Daft Punk; I've never heard a track of theirs in my life. They're the two guys with motorcycle helmets on?","In Israel, there's a lot to learn from anyone, because to live there you've got to deal with the truth. Things happen real fast. Your day goes from cool to catastrophic in one second. Israelis know that the cafe you're in could blow up, or the shopping mall, and they rock that.","I've been on 'Jay Leno,' and everyone likes Jay, but being on that show is a really boring afternoon. I sincerely like Jay, but I wouldn't want his job, because I'd have to interview Kathy Ireland, and there's nothing there I'd want to know.","I still have dreams about CBGB's. I still miss the place.","I read a bit of Ray Bradbury when I was a younger man. I don't read a lot of fiction anymore... like, none.","I was at the first Minor Threat show, and you could tell, 'This band is going to be the king of the town.' It was obvious. They were so good.","We're at peak oil, peak water, peak resources, and so either we figure it out and let science lead or we head down a very bad, dark trail to where a lot of people aren't going to make it.","I've been in Iraq, and it never occurred to me to go, 'Hey, this war is bogus,' to some guy who's 24 hours a day trying not to get shot at or blown up.","I'm terrified of motorcycles. I've been on one a couple of times. I did not like it.","If I'm jetlagging, and I've missed some meals, and it gets to that point in a movie that you're supposed to cry, I'll let my defences down from around my inherent standing level of cynicism, and I'll cry.","Even though I am not hungry when I get up, I try to eat to get me ready for the day. Within an hour of getting up.","I'd love to talk to Janeane Garafalo or Randi Rhodes or Stephanie Miller from Air America. I'm an Air American junkie; I listen to them every day.","I thought I was gonna be in the minimum-wage working world all my life.","Seven-11 is the pulse-beat of America. I think that Bruce Springsteen should do a song about a 7-11 in Asbury Park, New Jersey, but write it in such a way that American's youth can identify and slurp along with the Boss. Hail the Boss! Hail 7-11!","I'm disappointed by bands left and right, every day.","It's hard to get people at a record company to talk about music. They don't seem to want to talk about music, it's all marketing, and that's part of a record, you gotta get it out there, people have gotta hear it, but you could do it in a way that's not repulsive.","With a book, there's no volume to turn up. You're very naked with a book.","I get along with Australians really well. Everyone's usually really cool, and it's always a drag to leave.","The Bad Seeds are a band I will travel a great distance to see whenever possible.","It's easy for me to play bad guys because it's a very linear acting. Bad guys aren't empathetic. Being a bad guy is great because you're not friendly and you don't have to do much with your face.","I contribute a large amount of money to the Southern Poverty Law Center, so I'm on their mailing list for all their Klan Watch newsletters. I'm very well aware of White Power movements in America.","I hate painting with a broad brush, but I think the birther thing, at its root, is racist. The guy was born in Hawaii. A black guy is president. It's cool. Get over it. Just deal with it. There's nothing you could show these birther people that would shut them up.","No one should die when they're 50.","Let's pretend my career in music is a bell. Whether you like my music or not is up to you. But you've got to admit I rang that bell pretty hard and pretty often.","You can't get your head around something if you're yelling.","When I see the hatred exacted at Mr. Obama - you know, he lowered your taxes, killed your number one bad guy and got your guys out of Iraq - I don't understand why he seems to inflame people so much. You know, unless, unless there's a race problem.","I'm a good authoritarian figure; I don't know why. 'Can you be a cop?' Sure. 'Can you be a Marine?' Absolutely. Well, at least in a movie.","I'm a big Germs fan; most people are.","I'm of the opinion that the Democrats have the ideas I agree with more often than not. Reenergizing the middle class and giving people a break.","I have healthy disagreements with political parties I'm not aligned with, but I don't think it should be to the point where we're cursing and trying to strangle each other.","Fish is the only kind of respirating thing that I consume. Everything else I don't want any part of.","Young, gay and stuck in Arkansas? Sounds like a horror flick.","The arts in America exist in spite of America, not because of America.","I think self-reliance and self-responsibility and self-accountability will help you as a parent, a teacher, as a citizen as a friend.","When you're holding people's attention, I feel you must give them high-quality ingredients. They deserve nothing but your best. And if they need information, get it, cross-check it, and try to be right. Do not waste their time; do not enjoy the ego trip of being onstage.","After I wrapped 'Sons of Anarchy,' I traveled by myself for ten weeks. I started in Jordan and finished in Mali, in Timbuktu.","Barack Obama's administration responded to the Haitian crisis within 24 hours. Here comes the soldiers, here comes the food, go go go... Rush Limbaugh told his multi-millions of listeners that Obama only did that to gain favour with black people in America. This is the kind of idiocy that I have to deal with in my country.","Every politician, every president gets votes by getting people that don't like him to like him. That's why politicians are slippery: because they talk out of both sides of their mouth.","If you listen to the way I speak and watch the way I conduct myself - there's nothing about me that's rock n' roll. It's like, 'Hello, I'm in a rock n' roll band'. 'No, you're a narc.'","I never thought I was right for TV or that TV was right for me.","It's hard to judge literary merit.","Someone like Ashlee Simpson, she lip-synchs on 'Saturday Night Live,' gets totally called out la Milli Vanilli, and no one really cares that much. It doesn't make me hate Ashlee; she's just taking instructions.","The first Van Halen album makes Johnny Rotten out to be what he really was and still is: a hairdresser.","When I read that Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 had disappeared - a state-of-the-art Boeing 777, said to be an incredibly safe way to travel - I waited patiently for the chance to learn what happened.","One person's disaster is another person's talking point.","More and more, journalism seems to have hopped out of Truth's pocket and crept into another.","You might as well enjoy the day - you never know when and how painfully it could all end.","I don't know if you have ever seen the Woody Allen film 'Annie Hall,' but it is, in a way, to Los Angeles and 'Hollywood' what 'This Is Spinal Tap' is to many musicians.","Scott Asheton was a brilliant drummer, a natural musician.","We are misery-making machines! Homo sapiens has perfected the art of causing suffering. Pain is humankind's collective GDP.","If you think about it, every single species is endangered. Homo sapiens at the front of the line, mosquitoes and lawyers at the back.","We spend millions of dollars to remove pain from our lives. It's why so many people get hooked on painkillers. The body becomes addicted to painlessness. That tells you a lot.","My understanding of first-degree murder is that premeditation needs to be proven.","Young African-American males: Stop existing. It could get you killed."],"Henry S. Haskins":["Good behavior is the last refuge of mediocrity.","When a thing is not worth overdoing, leave it alone!","Many a man gets weary of clamping down on his rough impulses, which if given occasional release would encourage the living of life with salt in it, in place of dust.","Each experience through which we pass operates ultimately for our good. This is a correct attitude to adopt and we must be able to see it in that light.","Treat the other man's faith gently: it is all he has to believe with.","Some people are like wheelbarrows; useful only when pushed, and very easily upset. The time to stop talking is when the other person nods his head affirmatively but says nothing."],"Henry Samueli":["Passion is what gives meaning to our lives. It's what allows us to achieve success beyond our wildest imagination. Try to find a career path that you have a passion for.","A team may have some great players, but typically, the team that works best together does the best. I look at running Broadcom in the same way. We have a culture where people have different skill sets, but they are happy to leverage their skills to help others and to help the company.","I don't know if anybody thought about how much impact the iPhone could have on society.","To succeed in hockey, you need teamwork.","For me, it's almost a 24/7 process. It's not like I only think when I'm in the office sitting at my desk.","Don't make career choices on short-term financial gain. Job satisfaction and career enjoyment are far more important.","We covered every major segment of this broadband communications world.","Analog components don't 'scale' as well as digital components, but integrating them into relatively mature 28 nm platforms will accelerate the connection of everything from watches, personal healthcare, and home appliances to automotive, transportation, agriculture, manufacturing, and industrial controls.","The owner's job is to hire the general manager. The general manager's job is to run the hockey team.","Anytime you put a challenge out there, people come up with a creative solution on the software side.","You would rather pay $50 a month for a cable modem than a free voiceband modem because of the attractiveness of that broadband connection.","We need to get smarter about hardware and software innovation in order to get the most value from the emerging Internet of Things.","Once you used a computer with a broadband connection, you knew you would never be able go back to the old voiceband modem connection - even if it was free.","It's the whole big picture that we have to look at to create an organization that wins over the long term. And to just shoot from the hip on a decision based on winning over a 10-game period. No, that doesn't make sense.","Innovators are developing the ideas and bringing them to life in amazing new applications. All we, as an industry, need to do now is focus on standardizing the interfaces to ensure interoperability - and stand out of the way.","I'm a perfectionist. And that's served me very well in my career. It allows me to handle these large, complex problems without letting things fall through the cracks... That is the mentality you have to have to attack these complex problems of chip design, for example, when you're overwhelmed with complexity.","The big advancement in our BCM7445 home gateway chip is that it uses the next-generation compression technology called HEVC - High-Efficiency Video Coding.","You're not going to see a wholesale switch over to all 4K by 2K. It will start with one, two, three, four channels, just like high definition (HD) when it was first introduced.","In the 2015 time frame, you'll probably see more mainstream adoption of set-top box technology using UltraHD. We'll start shipping it in 2014, but the volume will take off in probably 2015.","Older generations of Wi-Fi weren't quite robust enough to deliver video in the home without breaking up and losing packets and so forth. 5G Wi-Fi gives you extended reach, extended data rates, and more robust coverage.","Just getting young kids excited about hockey, then they'll want to skate, they'll want to start joining junior leagues, they'll want to play in high school, etc., so we're trying to expand at all levels. That's good for the sport, and it's good for the Ducks long term.","We're seeing a lot of major companies as well as startups coming up with smartwatches that replicate a lot of the functionality you might have in your smartphone. Will it be as big a market as smartphones? Probably not, but it still can be a very substantial market.","You can't create a mass market if you don't have a common standard.","LTE has accelerated faster than most people had anticipated. It really took off very quickly from the time it was introduced. We did have our internal development road map, but we just needed to accelerate it.","We are happy to get great technology from anywhere, and we have eyes and ears that are checking out companies all over.","When we started out, you could design a chip with a few guys in a basement.","The high-tech business, the semiconductor business, it's very competitive. You're out there every day slugging it out, no different from players slugging it out on the ice.","It is always the genuine Teemu Selanne that you're seeing. He never puts on a show. It is Teemu. And that's what we love about him.","For me, it's just a pleasure to be out in the community wearing my Ducks logo on shirts and hats and so forth in representing the team.","I don't try to try to judge people on performance in one short period of time.","You have to want to put a competitive, Stanley Cup-caliber team on the ice in contrast to wanting to hopefully someday financially break even. So you have to really balance expenses with revenue.","The Honda Center is a wonderful arena. And it's a great arena, not only for the NHL, but it would be a great arena for an NBA team.","Long-term career aspirations encompass emotional and intellectual impact of work on society.","I just took it one step at a time and let fate determine my destiny.","Chips will continue to shrink, of course. We, along with other semiconductor companies, are continuing to push toward the next goal of 10 nm, but going beyond 10 nm will require the development of new technologies, materials, and manufacturing processes that are still being perfected."],"Henry Selick":["Every kid has a toy that they believe is their best friend, that they believe communicates with them, and they imagine it being alive, their toy horse or car or whatever it is. Stop-motion is the only medium where we literally can make a toy come to life, an actual object.","What stop-motion does best is present real objects magically brought to life in a very imperfect situation; the hand of the artist is there, the electricity of someone touching, massaging and torturing themselves to get life out of an inanimate object.","CG can do anything, but it can't do everything well. What it naturally can do is special effects. But using stop-motion comes from our desire to do handmade stuff. There are always going to be kids who get out whatever it might be - clay, bits of wire, Barbie dolls, Legos. They want to tell little stories.","Underneath this tired, middle-aged exterior, I'm an 11 year old kid.","As a director, I'm not the one animating every frame, every shot. I'm moving around like a surgeon on rounds, or a farmer checking in on all the plants being grown, pruning and adjusting. For me, it's a very exciting job.","I think that one of the things that I can do is I seem to have the ability to zoom in super tight for very small details, but then jump back for sort of that big picture perspective. And I think that ultimately, that's one of my strengths, because you have - every detail matters.","Stop-motion is sort of twitchy; you can feel the life in it. If we were to remove that completely, there'd be no point in it.","Morals always sound like cliches, but usually cliches are based on things that are ultimate truths. Be grateful for what you have; appreciate what's right there in front of you.","Kids love to be scared - there's way to do it right, and ways to do it wrong.","I was influenced by Ray Harryhausen and Lotte Reiniger, with her twitchy, cutout animation, which I happened to see at a very young age, but also by the Warner Bros. cartoons, 'Tom and Jerry,' and of course Disney. And also by Fellini's 'Giulietta of the Spirits' and Kurosawa's 'Ran.' And by other American illustrators and painters.","Having to make a blockbuster every time puts unhealthy pressure on creatives. The pressure on the filmmakers is so intense, I think it stifles the creativity.","No one's ever going to make a PG-13 animated film unless David Fincher executive produces it and puts it out on Netflix, and then if it's a success everyone will change.","You know, I love stop-motion. I've done almost all the styles of animation: I was a 2D animator. I've done cutout animation. I did a CG short a few years ago, 'Moongirl,' for young kids. Stop-motion is what I keep coming back to, because it has a primal nature. It can never be perfect.","I learned my lesson that in the live-action world, you have to earn the support of people over a very, very long time. And in animation, I already have the support.","I was at Disney for about four years, so I made good friends there. It was a time of not a lot of creativity. It was the end of the first great era, with a few of the original animators. They called them the Nine Old Men. I learned a lot from them, but it wasn't going to be a future home for me.","Kids love to be scared; we all do. But there's a difference between leaving them hanging out there, with their fears, and then bringing them safely home. Kids love it when someone like them stands up against real evil, something really horrendous and frightening, and win.","Just like those little Viewmaster slides, there's a inherent magic that's captured in 3D that you can't get in drawn animation or in CG.","Puppets seem like vampires sometimes. They live, and you're depleted.","There's the animation ghetto of feature films in this country. There's this flavor at DreamWorks, and Pixar does their own thing, and generally they're safe. But if you look at Walt Disney's original films, at the time and in the context, they weren't safe. They were really dark and troubling.","Any type of animation, it could be really super crude or very sophisticated, it doesn't mean anything if we don't make this point in this shot, this one here and this one here. There's the saying, 'One shot, one thought.' It's pretty much a true way to go.","I think stop-motion has always been semi-obsolete. And stop-motion animators - people like myself - love it so much that we're always going to be looking for new ways to make our films.","My mother is a huge fan of my work. I told her about 'Coraline' long before the film was made, and she got the book and read it. She reminded me that when I was about five years old, I used to sit in the kitchen for hours and talk about my 'other' family in Africa, my other mother and father. I had totally forgotten that.","Cyclops, that's like this primal fear. I had dreams for years that the Cyclops was a small creature living in our huge fish tank at home, and at night, it was going to grow to full size and come after me.","Very few people have made the transition from animation to live-action; I'm certainly not one.","I feel I'm just meant to do stop-motion. Live-action is much more glamorous to some, but it's basically a whole army of people focused on one thing.","People are very harsh critics of animated humans.","While I was making 'Coraline' I barely got to see any films at all, so I've got a lot of catching up to do.","There's very few people who want to just make beautiful films that make money, when they can make films that make huge money.","There's always kids who become stop motion animators. I get stuff all the time. They put it on YouTube. It's exciting to see.","Unless you have kids, you actually have no idea what kids are watching on TV these days.","I think it's important that kids see another kid - Coraline - who doesn't have guns, she doesn't have super-powers, she's not a super-genius. To see a pretty normal kid - I mean, she's probably a little more curious, a little more stubborn, but she's a real kid - go up against something that's truly dark and evil and powerful. And she does win.","There's this long tradition of... even 'Where The Wild Things Are,' which many people consider the best kids' picture book of all time. It was considered revolutionary, and some libraries wouldn't carry it. But it's a classic because it taps into empowerment for kids, kids facing dangers and winning.","People are always telling me that boys won't go to girls' movies and vice versa. It's not true.","If you're drawing humans, it can be detrimental to be too naturalistic, which is like animating little corpses.","I'm meant to be an animation director. That world, and the culture of stop-motion, is where I want to live. It's more my problem than Hollywood's. I'm not attuned to Hollywood.","In all animation, if it's done quickly, you'll know it. And if you're very slow and careful with it, it's going to look a little more beautiful. It's just compressing time into seconds.","When you're writing, it's all up to you, and you don't have to make any compromises. And when you're directing, there's this intense pleasure you get from working with all these really talented people, and pooling the efforts towards a common goal. I like all the aspects of film-making.","'Coraline' is Neil Gaiman's book, it sold a lot, it has a big fan base. It was originally conceived to be live action, but I never really wanted it to be. I always thought that it would work better as an animated film.","I'm looking at some comedic horror films because I have often been accused of being too dark. I'm not dark, not compared with 'Saw' or anything like that. So I'm looking at live-action horror films, but not slasher ones - ones that have humor and maybe some social satire.","We can still do a stop motion feature for about one-third of what it costs Pixar or DreamWorks or Blue Sky to make a feature. But nobody is interested in a film that cost $50 to 60 million with the potential to do $120 million. They want to risk big money to make huge money.","I have more faith in doing something creative for a cable station or something like Yahoo or Google or Amazon. What Netflix did with 'House of Cards' and David Fincher was brilliant. That is inspiring to me. I think there is more chance for creativity in animation, it just hasn't happened there yet.","What I personally gravitate toward tends to be fantasy, medium dark - not too dark - fairy tales and sci fi. Stop-motion takes something on the page that's really dark and adds a little sweetness to it, a living toys realm.","Making 'Coraline' was one of the great filmmaking experiences of my life.","Nobody does animation better than Disney; it's just that some of us wanted out of the box. Burton was one. I was another. We were the mutual complaint society.","We are suffering from a glut of too many 3-D movies and not enough screens."],"Henry Silverman":["I'm on the Business Roundtable, the CEOs of the largest 100-odd companies in the country. Most of these people wanted very much to be the CEO of a large public company but realize that it's not exactly what they had anticipated, for lots of reasons. One is competition has gotten a lot worse, and more global.","Any dope with a checkbook can buy a company. It's what you do afterward that matters.","I've always dreamed of franchising an airline, but I haven't been able to figure out how to do it.","When you are buying companies, everyone in the company feels very good.

So it's a massive honour to be here and to be part of this team and to represent this country. So for the kids back in Fiji, if they dream big, there are no limits to what they can achieve.","The more time you can spend in sevens, the better. Time is invaluable; there's no substitute for that.","Personally, just being able to compete in an Olympics, being part of an Opening Ceremony wearing a green jacket with the rest of the Australian Olympic team, would be a more than a dream come true.","Obviously growing up, the ultimate dream is to play for Fiji. When I was growing up, everyone wanted to play for Fiji on the biggest stage, which is Hong Kong Sevens, and then the other events on the HSBC Series. So I guess the biggest moment I can have is to play against Fiji: my homeland.","I hope, for my generation and for children at high school aspiring to be rugby players, that they will hear the name Speight and associate it with rugby more than anything else.","There are certain people who aren't with me any more, but they're with me in spirit. I just want to do them proud and live up to expectations that they had."],"Henry Spencer":["Progress requires setbacks; the only sure way to avoid failure is not to try.","Testing a parachute drop of a heavy object is not simple.","My one concern is that when money gets tight, it's easy to cut R&D funding that isn't tied to a specific project - look at what's happened to NASA's aviation research.","SpaceX does seem to have had a run of bad luck, with its first three launches all failing.","Solid-fuel rockets can't easily be shut down on command.","Is manned space exploration important? Yes - not least because it simply works much better than sending robots.","Liquid oxygen is one of the cheapest manufactured substances on Earth. In large quantities, it costs pennies per kilogram - cheaper than milk or beer.","Developing expendable rockets is always going to be painful and expensive. Throwing the whole rocket away on each attempt not only costs a lot, it also hampers figuring out just what went wrong because you don't get the rocket back for inspection.","In the long run, it's impossible to make progress without sometimes having setbacks, although people who get lucky on their first attempt sometimes forget this.","The demise of Constellation is not the death of a dream. It's just the end of an illusion.","Sure, there were hopes that Constellation's systems could later be adapted to support more ambitious goals. But Apollo had those hopes, too. It didn't work in 1970, and it wasn't going to work in 2020.","Supplying fuel for a Mars expedition from the lunar surface is often suggested, but it's hard to make it pay off - Moon bases are expensive, and just buying more rockets to launch fuel from Earth is relatively cheap.","The communications delays between Earth and Mars can be half an hour or more, so the people on the ground can't participate minute by minute in Mars surface activities.","The Moon may not be quite as appealing as Mars, but it's still a complex and poorly understood world, with many questions still unanswered.","In 1960-61, a small group of female pilots went through many of the same medical tests as the Mercury astronauts and scored very well on them - in fact, better than some of the astronauts did.","NASA has never had a problem finding capable people to be astronauts. NASA's problem was, and still is, finding ways to cut the list of capable applicants down to a manageable length.","Spaceflight, especially in the Mercury spacecraft, clearly wasn't going to be much like flying an airplane.","Not until the space shuttle started flying did NASA concede that some astronauts didn't have to be fast-jet pilots. And at that point, sure enough, women started becoming astronauts.","Since SpaceX's very beginnings, they have talked about recovering and reusing at least the first stages of their rockets.","The Orion capsule uses an escape system quite like that of the Apollo spacecraft in the 1960s and 70s: an 'escape tower' containing a solid-fuel rocket that will pull it up and away from Ares I in a pinch.","Whether solid rockets are more or less likely to fail than liquid-fuel rockets is debatable. More serious, though, is that when they do fail, it's usually violent and spectacular.","Past experience, on the shuttle and the Titan rockets, suggests that large multi-segment solid rockets have a probability of failure of 0.5 to 1 per cent.","Sometimes people wonder why aeroplanes are so cheap and rockets are so expensive. Even the most superficial comparison shows one obvious difference: aeroplane engines use outside air to burn their fuel, while rockets have to carry their own oxidisers along.","Rocket engines generally are simpler than jet engines, not more complicated.","Trying to build a spaceship by making an aeroplane fly faster and higher is like trying to build an aeroplane by making locomotives faster and lighter - with a lot of effort, perhaps you could get something that more or less works, but it really isn't the right way to proceed.","As plans for the first lunar landing started to be made, nobody had really thought about who would be out first.","The original specifications for Apollo navigation called for the ability to fly a complete mission, including a lunar landing, with no help from Earth - none, not even voice communications.","On the technical side, Apollo 8 was mainly a test flight for the Saturn V and the Apollo spacecraft. The main spacecraft system that needed testing on a real lunar flight was the onboard navigation system.","Speaking of photography, while the Apollo 8 crew shot hundreds of photos, there was one that got everybody's attention: a blue-and-white Earth rising over a gray moonscape.","In a small spacecraft, it was hard for the other two guys to sleep when the on-duty man was talking to Mission Control regularly.","Claiming that solid rockets are necessary for a heavy-lift launcher is obvious nonsense.","Large solid rockets have never been a very good way to build launchers that might have crews on top, especially because of the problems in getting the crew away from a failing launcher.","It's true that Apollo 10's lander was overweight. Late in the craft's development, it became clear that its ballooning weight was endangering the whole mission.","Reusable rockets promise much easier testing because you should usually get them back, and you can debug as you go rather than having to get everything perfect the first time.","If your goal is to change the world, you can't start by doing things the same old way because it sells better.","The key virtue of orbital assembly is that it eliminates the tight connection between the size of the expedition and the size of the rockets used to launch it.","In the first few years, it was at least plausible to come in in the morning and read all the Usenet traffic that had come in, and 15 minutes later be off doing something useful.","The Apollo programme of the 1960s had some weight problems, too; in particular, the lunar lander needed some fairly drastic weight-reduction work.","An experienced designer with more freedom to act might have realised that there was just too much optimism in the Ares I concept: that a shuttle SRB was simply too small as a first stage for a rocket carrying the relatively heavy Orion spacecraft.","Historically, the U.S.'s big launchers fly seldom enough that their costs are dominated by annual upkeep of facilities and staff, not by the actual cost of each launch. The expensive part is maintaining the launch capability, not actually conducting launches.","Technically and financially, it might still make sense to give up on Ares I and simply write off the money spent on it, but politically, that's probably impossible.","Foul-ups in testing are not uncommon, especially when the test setup is being tried for the first time.","One of the headaches of high-tech test programmes is having to debug the test arrangements before you can start debugging the things you're trying to test.","Sometimes a malfunctioning test setup actually gives the tested system a chance to show what it can do in an unrehearsed emergency. During a test of an Apollo escape system in the 1960s, the escape system successfully got the capsule clear of a malfunctioning test rocket."],"Henry St. John":["Truth lies within a little and certain compass, but error is immense.","Liberty is to the collective body, what health is to every individual body.

The view from the $250,000 apartment covers a lot of ground, most of it condemned.","The only thing wrong with immortality is that it tends to go on forever.","A city is a crazy concrete jungle whose people at the end of each day somehow make a small step ahead against terrible odds.","Just two days in Manhattan and you find yourself looking for a place to wash your handkerchief after you wipe your forehead and it comes away black. Is there a dirtier or more fascinating city anywhere in the land? The answer to both parts of the question has to be positively negative.","I tend to live in the past because most of my life is there.","Cockroaches and socialites are the only things that can stay up all night and eat anything.","Logic is no answer to passion.","A man begins cutting his wisdom teeth the first time he bites off more than he can chew.","The only way to fight a thing like 50 is to stay au courant if it kills you.","San Franciscans have a bond of self-satisfaction bordering on smugness.","New Yorkers are stuck in a gloomy mucilage of mutual commiseration.","Old San Francisco - the one so many nostalgics yearn for - had buildings that related well to each other.","When a place advertises itself as 'World Famous,' you may be sure it isn't.","Satire of satire tends to be self-canceling, and deliberate shock tactics soon lose their ability to shock, especially when they're too deliberate.","Americans are pragmatic, relatively uncomplicated, hearty and given to broad humor.","A good column is one that sells paper. It doesn't matter how beautifully it is written and how much you admire the author... if it doesn't sell any papers, it's not a good column. It's a terrible yardstick to use, but in the newspaper business, that's the whole thing.","Philosophically, I don't like doing commercials."],"Herb Elliott":["Training was a time where resolutions made in the enthusiasm of an inspired moment were put to personal test.","It is the inspiration of the Olympic Games that drives people not only to compete but to improve, and to bring lasting spiritual and moral benefits to the athlete and inspiration to those lucky enough to witness the athletic dedication.","The greatest stimulator of my running career was fear."],"Herb Kelleher":["I tell my employees that we're in the service business, and it's incidental that we fly airplanes.","Your employees come first. And if you treat your employees right, guess what? Your customers come back, and that makes your shareholders happy. Start with employees and the rest follows from that.","You can't have a mid-life crisis in the airline industry because every day is a crisis.","It is my practice to try to understand how valuable something is by trying to imagine myself without it.","Keep costs low and spirits high, and the people of Southwest Airlines will keep LUV in the air.","Wild Turkey whiskey and Philip Morris cigarettes are essential to the maintenance of human life!","One piece of advice that always stuck in my mind is that people should be respected and trusted as people, not because of their position or title.","The spirit of Southwest Airlines is exuberant, it's caring, it's dedicated, it's diligent, it's fun, it's rewarding, it's a joy.","The people of Southwest have always been my pride, my joy and my love. Their indomitable dedication and esprit de corps have taken Southwest from a three-airplane dream to a 500-airplane reality.","Just because you don't announce your plan doesn't mean you don't have one.","A company is stronger if it is bound by love rather than by fear.","Power should be reserved for weightlifting and boats, and leadership really involves responsibility.","I forgive all personal weaknesses except egomania and pretension.","When I started working on Southwest Airlines, I kid you not, only people flying on business and very wealthy people ever flew.","I guess the worst moment I ever had in business was the fear that Southwest Airlines wouldn't get off the ground.","I think my greatest moment in business was when the first Southwest airplane arrived after four years of litigation, and I walked up to it and I kissed that baby on the lips and I cried.","I've found that many of the greatest ideas surface in bars because that's where many people cultivate inspiration.","The clear, unmistakable sign of a bureaucrat is somebody who worries about whether he has a window.","I'd say my mother made more of a difference to me than anyone else did. I know that's a conventional and perhaps mundane answer, but my family was blown apart at the start of World War II."],"Herb Kohl":["We cannot and will not ban the creation of violent video games. But, we can prevent the distribution of these disturbing games to children, where their effects can be negative.","It's time to stop defending a system that is clearly in dire need of reform, stop issuing reports and setting up new roadblocks, and start providing Americans with prescription drugs that are both safe and affordable.","We need to take steps to strengthen and mend Social Security so that its promise of a secure retirement is just as real for seniors in the future as it is today.","Bankruptcy is a serious decision that people have to make.","When the President makes something a priority, we see action.","Even as we pour hundreds of billions of dollars into our efforts in the Middle East, there is much that needs to be done to win the war of ideas in the Muslim world and beyond.","After a week of back and forth, and forth and back over firearms, it's good to see a consensus developing on this common-sense amendment to keep handguns away from children.","As all of us with any involvement in sports knows, no two umpires or no two referees have the same strike zone or call the same kind of a basketball game.","Before we decide to trust you with this power, we ask you to stand before the public and explain your views. Justice may be blind, but it should not be deaf.","I will vote my hopes and not my fears."],"Herb Ritts":["Within two hours of where I live, you have mountains and desert as location. I like the natural elements that abstract into light, texture, shape and shadow.","I like form and shape and strength in pictures.","I always enjoyed art history because, growing up in California, my exposure was limited, and it was a new experience. To learn the history of art opened up certain things to me, made me see. It intrigued me.","I think a lot of the time these days people are so concerned about having the right camera and the right film and the right lenses and all the special effects that go along with it, even the computer, that they're missing the key element.","Regardless of whether you speak the language or are familiar with a culture, the picture should hold up.","I'm pretty selective. I generally edit the contact sheets and then do work prints. Because I have my own lab and printers, I can afford the luxury of going through the contact sheets for black-and-white, making up work prints, seeing them big, and honing them down.","Actually, when I first started dabbling in photography, I was still working for my parents as a salesman.","For me, the most important thing I learned was just honing my eye. I think I had a good eye.","Once you develop your own style, you know when you're able to give your best. Feeling at home is part of it, and I don't think that's an L.A. thing. It's a matter of the environment and of what affects you.","When you start out, you're not really aware. I didn't have a sense of photographic history.","Even though I didn't get a business degree, I enjoyed learning about economics.","Generally, the French highly promote culture and the arts, and photography is in their blood.","I think knowing people by first names, not by what they do sexually, is really what it's about. Not being afraid. Fear is the enemy. I've always been comfortable with being gay.","I was an economics major, which I enjoyed because I had a good business sense.","I'd go down to the end of my street, to a garage that had a certain feeling about it, or a particular light; I'd take a picture of a friend who needed a head shot. That's how I learned, instead of having school assignments and learning camera techniques.","Many people who excel are self-taught.","That's why I felt so at home when I went to Africa. It didn't matter that I was halfway around the world in a foreign country, because all those elements are universal. And I think that's one thing about my work: It's universal.","The education, the cultural awareness, is different in Europe, especially in France, from that in the United States. So I think the public will be much more appreciative of many images.","Well, I liked it - that was the main thing. I liked it, but I didn't think of it in terms of a career. I didn't really know; I didn't really think about it. One thing just led to another until finally I quit my job as a salesman and found myself working as a photographer.","What I particularly liked was that, coming from California and not being involved in the New York scene, I developed my personal way, in my own way, at my own pace.","I did grow up next door to Steve McQueen, who was a very famous movie star at the time, but as a kid it didn't impress me. We always had great fun with him. He would take us out on Sundays on his motorcycles, riding around in the desert; he was like a second father."],"Herb Trimpe":["I think that most of us can identify with the change that happens to Bruce Banner. We all have a little of both inside us. I think this is an important theme in defining the character.","The Hulk is not basically violent, but only reacts violently when a threat is perceived. He has a certain passion for life. He is drawn towards kids and animals and the downtrodden.","Teaching is like flying a plane. You leave school one day feeling like you're spiraling down toward the trees, expecting that the next day the crash will come. You brace yourself for the impact, only to find that things have leveled out at treetop height, and you climb and enjoy the remainder of the flight.","In 1996, after 29 years as an artist for Marvel Comics, I got fired - 56 years old, two children still in college, and no job.","I had joined Marvel in 1967, after a year in Vietnam and three years as a student at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan. Stan Lee, then the editor-in-chief, hired me as a production assistant.","I've decided to go for a B.A. in art. It's the shortest route to a degree. I'm thinking about teaching.","There's something about dealing with government agencies that makes you feel like a criminal.","When I looked at the other artists when I first started at Marvel, I was surrounded by giants. It was very intimidating.","The only thing that remained consistent over the years was my ability and enthusiasm to tell the story."],"Herbert A. Simon":["The choices we make lead up to actual experiences. It is one thing to decide to climb a mountain. It is quite another to be on top of it.","I started off thinking that maybe the social sciences ought to have the kinds of mathematics that the natural sciences had. That works a little bit in economics because they talk about costs, prices and quantities of goods.","Anything that gives us new knowledge gives us an opportunity to be more rational.","My research career has been devoted to understanding human decision-making and problem-solving processes. The pursuit of this goal has led me into the fields of political science, economics, cognitive psychology, computer science and philosophy of science, among others.","A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.","To deal with these problems - of world population and hunger, of peace, of energy and mineral resources, of environmental pollution, of poverty - we must broaden and deepen our knowledge of nature's laws, and we must broaden and deepen our understanding of the laws of human behavior.","I was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on June 15, 1916. My father, an electrical engineer, had come to the United States in 1903 after earning his engineering diploma at the Technische Hochschule of Darmstadt, Germany.","You can love two or more women at once... but you cannot be loyal to more than one.","Whereas economic man maximises, selects the best alternative from among all those available to him, his cousin, administrative man, satisfices, looks for a course of action that is satisfactory or 'good enough'.","Among my European ancestors were piano builders, goldsmiths, and vintners but, to the best of my knowledge, no professionals of any kind.","My home nurtured in me an early attachment to books and other things of the intellect, to music, and to the out of doors.","By a combination of formal training and self study, the latter continuing systematically well into the 1940s, I was able to gain a broad base of knowledge in economics and political science, together with reasonable skills in advanced mathematics, symbolic logic, and mathematical statistics.","The density of settlement of economists over the whole empire of economic science is very uneven, with a few areas of modest size holding the bulk of the population.","Time and again, we have found the 'idle' truths arrived at through the process of inquiry to be of the greatest moment for practical human affairs.","Like Humpty Dumpty, we can make words mean anything we want them to mean.","The classical theory of omniscient rationality is strikingly simple and beautiful.","The Nobel prizes memorialize Alfred Nobel's faith in the contribution that human thought, directed to science and art, can make to human welfare.","I like to think that since I was about 19, I have studied human decision-making and problem-solving.","I realized that you could formulate theories about human and social phenomena in language and pictures and whatever you wanted on the computer, and you didn't have to go through this straitjacket, adding a lot of numbers.","When computers came along, I felt for the first time that I had the proper tools for the kind of theoretical work I wanted to do. So I moved over to that, and that got me into psychology.","Human knowledge has been changing from the word 'go,' and people, in certain respects, behave more rationally than they did when they didn't have it. They spend less time doing rain dances and more time seeding clouds.","I tried to develop some theories that took account of the uncertainty in the world and the complexity in the world.","I think those who object to my characterizing man as simple want somehow to retain a deep mystery at his core.","In arguing that machines think, we are in the same fix as Darwin when he argued that man shares common ancestors with monkeys, or Galileo when he argued that the Earth spins on its axis.","What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients.","Viewed as a geometric figure, the ant's path is irregular, complex, and hard to describe."],"Herbert Bayard Swope":["I cannot give you the formula for success, but I can give you the formula for failure - which is: Try to please everybody.","The secret of a successful newspaper is to take one story each day and bang the hell out of it. Give the public what it wants to have and part of what it ought to have whether it wants it or not.","Don't forget that the only two things people read in a story are the first and last sentences. Give them blood in the eye on the first one.","The first duty of a newspaper is to be accurate. If it be accurate, it follows that it is fair."],"Herbert Beerbohm Tree":["Ladies, just a little more virginity, if you don't mind.","People are too apt to treat God as if he were a minor royalty.","I was born old and get younger every day. At present I am sixty years young.","He is an old bore. Even the grave yawns for him.","Every man is a potential genius until he does something.","Never say a humorous thing to a man who does not possess humor. He will always use it in evidence against you.","A committee should consist of three men, two of whom are absent."],"Herbert Croly":["The average American is nothing if not patriotic.","The more consciously democratic Americans became, however, the less they were satisfied with a conception of the Promised Land, which went no farther than a pervasive economic prosperity guaranteed by free institutions.","The interest which lay behind Federalism was that of well-to-do citizens in a stable political and social order, and this interest aroused them to favor and to seek some form of political organization which was capable of protecting their property and promoting its interest.","So far I, at least, have no fault to find with implications of Hamilton's Federalism, but unfortunately his policy was in certain other respects tainted with a more doubtful tendency.","The popular will cannot be taken for granted, it must be created.","The only fruitful promise of which the life of any individual or any nation can be possessed, is a promise determined by an ideal.","Democracy may mean something more than a theoretically absolute popular government, but it assuredly cannot mean anything less.","Of course, Americans have no monopoly of patriotic enthusiasm and good faith.","The higher American patriotism, on the other hand, combines loyalty to historical tradition and precedent with the imaginative projection of an ideal national Promise.","I am not a prophet in any sense of the word, and I entertain an active and intense dislike of the foregoing mixture of optimism, fatalism, and conservatism.","American history contains much matter for pride and congratulation, and much matter for regret and humiliation.","Had it not been for the Atlantic Ocean and the virgin wilderness, the United States would never have been the Land of Promise.","To the European immigrant - that is, to the aliens who have been converted into Americans by the advantages of American life - the Promise of America has consisted largely in the opportunity which it offered of economic independence and prosperity.","Let it be immediately added, however, that this economic independence and prosperity has always been absolutely associated in the American mind with free political institutions.","The American economic, political, and social organization has given to its citizens the benefits of material prosperity, political liberty, and a wholesome natural equality; and this achievement is a gain, not only to Americans, but to the world and to civilization.","The moral and social aspiration proper to American life is, of course, the aspiration vaguely described by the word democratic; and the actual achievement of the American nation points towards an adequate and fruitful definition of the democratic ideal.","Unless the great majority of Americans not only have, but believe they have, a fair chance, the better American future will be dangerously compromised.","When the Promise of American life is conceived as a national ideal, whose fulfillment is a matter of artful and laborious work, the effect thereof is substantially to identify the national purpose with the social problem.","The Constitution was the expression not only of a political faith, but also of political fears. It was wrought both as the organ of the national interest and as the bulwark of certain individual and local rights.","In Jefferson's mind democracy was tantamount to extreme individualism.","The adoption by Jefferson and the Republicans of the political structure of their opponents is of an importance hardly inferior to that of the adoption of the Constitution by the states.","When Jefferson and the Republicans rallied to the Union and to the existing Federalist organization, the fabric of traditional American democracy was almost completely woven.","The combination of Federalism and Republicanism which formed the substance of the system, did not constitute a progressive and formative political principle, but it pointed in the direction of a constructive formula.","The first phase of American political history was characterized by the conflict between the Federalists and the Republicans, and it resulted in the complete triumph of the latter.","The years between 1800 and 1825 were distinguished, so far as our domestic development was concerned, by the growth of the Western pioneer Democracy in power and self-consciousness.","Our country was thereby saved from the consequences of its distracting individualistic conception of democracy, and its merely legal conception of nationality. It was because the followers of Jackson and Douglas did fight for it, that the Union was preserved."],"Herbert Gold":["Literature boils with the madcap careers of writers brought to the edge by the demands of living on their nerves, wringing out their memories and their nightmares to extract meaning, truth, beauty.","He carried his childhood like a hurt warm bird held to his middle-aged breast.","Diverting the internal traffic between the Writer as Angel of Light and the Writer as Hustler is that scribbling child in a grown-up body wondering if anybody is listening."],"Herbert Hoover":["Freedom is the open window through which pours the sunlight of the human spirit and human dignity.","There is no employing class, no working class, no farming class. You may pigeonhole a man or woman as a farmer or a worker or a professional man or an employer or even a banker. But the son of the farmer will be a doctor or a worker or even a banker, and his daughter a teacher. The son of a worker will be an employer - or maybe president.","Fishing is much more than fish. It is the great occasion when we may return to the fine simplicity of our forefathers.","Older men declare war. But it is the youth that must fight and die.","The use of the atomic bomb, with its indiscriminate killing of women and children, revolts my soul.","Economic depression cannot be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement. Economic wounds must be healed by the action of the cells of the economic body - the producers and consumers themselves.","When all the routines and details and the human bores get on our nerves, we just yearn to go away from here to somewhere else. To go fishing is a sound, a valid, and an accepted reason for an escape. It requires no explanation.","All men are equal before fish.","Blessed are the young for they shall inherit the national debt.","The spirit of liberalism is to create free men; it is not the regimentation of men.","Honor is not the exclusive property of any political party.","I am proud to have been born in Iowa. Through the eyes of a ten-year-old boy, it was a place of adventure and daily discoveries - the wonder of the growing crops, the excitements of the harvest, the journeys to the woods for nuts and hunting, the joys of snowy winters, the comfort of the family fireside, of good food and tender care.","About the time we can make the ends meet, somebody moves the ends.","When there is a lack of honor in government, the morals of the whole people are poisoned.","The New Deal repudiation of democracy has left the Republican Party alone the guardian of the Ark of the Covenant with its charter of freedom.","The great liability of the engineer compared to men of other professions is that his works are out in the open where all can see them. His acts, step by step, are in hard substance. He cannot bury his mistakes in the grave like the doctors. He cannot argue them into thin air or blame the judge like the lawyers.","When we are sick, we want an uncommon doctor; when we have a construction job to do, we want an uncommon engineer, and when we are at war, we want an uncommon general. It is only when we get into politics that we are satisfied with the common man.","Competition is not only the basis of protection to the consumer, but is the incentive to progress.","Public health service should be as fully organized and as universally incorporated into our governmental system as is public education. The returns are a thousand fold in economic benefits, and infinitely more in reduction of suffering and promotion of human happiness.","Peace is not made at the council table or by treaties, but in the hearts of men.","I'm the only person of distinction who has ever had a depression named for him.","In America today, we are nearer a final triumph over poverty than is any other land.","Wisdom consists not so much in knowing what to do in the ultimate as knowing what to do next.","While the crash only took place six months ago, I am convinced we have now passed the worst, and with continued unity of effort, we shall rapidly recover. There is one certainty of the future of a people of the resources, intelligence and character of the people of the United States - that is, prosperity.","Democracy is not static. It is a living force. Every new idea, every new invention offers opportunity for both good and evil.","Within the soul of America is freedom of mind and spirit in man. Here alone are the open windows through which pours the sunlight of the human spirit. Here alone is human dignity not a dream but an accomplishment. Perhaps it is not perfect, but it is more full in realization here than any other place in the world.","Economic freedom cannot be sacrificed if political freedom is to be preserved.","The slogan of progress is changing from the full dinner pail to the full garage.","Those who have a true understanding of America know that we have no desire for territorial expansion, for economic or other domination of other peoples. Such purposes are repugnant to our ideals of human freedom.","Wisdom oft times consists of knowing what to do next.","No public man can be just a little crooked.","This is not a showman's job. I will not step out of character.","It is a paradox that every dictator has climbed to power on the ladder of free speech. Immediately on attaining power each dictator has suppressed all free speech except his own.","There are only three ways to meet the unpaid bills of a nation. The first is taxation. The second is repudiation. The third is inflation.","It is just as important that business keep out of government as that government keep out of business.","We have not yet reached the goal but... we shall soon, with the help of God, be in sight of the day when poverty shall be banished from this nation.","Self-government does not and should not imply the use of political agencies alone. Progress is born of cooperation in the community - not from governmental restraints.","Next to religion, baseball has had a greater impact on our American way of life than any other American institution.","The engineer performs many public functions from which he gets only philosophical satisfactions. Most people do not know it, but he is an economic and social force.","It is the youth who must inherit the tribulation, the sorrow... that are the aftermath of war.","The glory of the nation rests in the character of her men. And character comes from boyhood. Thus, every boy is a challenge to his elders.","Children are our most valuable natural resource.","A good many things go around in the dark besides Santa Claus.","New discoveries in science will continue to create a thousand new frontiers for those who still would adventure.","The President is not only the leader of a party, he is the President of the whole people. He must interpret the conscience of America. He must guide his conduct by the idealism of our people.","Freedom does not die from frontal attack. It dies because men in power no longer believe in a system based upon liberty.","Peace can be promoted by the limitation of arms and by the creation of the instrumentality for peaceful settlement of controversies. But it will become a reality only through self-restraint and active effort in friendliness and helpfulness.","The United States fully accepts the profound truth that our own progress, prosperity, and peace are interlocked with the progress, prosperity, and peace of all humanity.","The worst evil of disregard for some law is that it destroys respect for all law.","There are only two occasions when Americans respect privacy, especially in Presidents. Those are prayer and fishing.","Prosperity cannot be restored by raids upon the public Treasury.","No greater nor more affectionate honor can be conferred on an American than to have a public school named after him.","The human animal originally came from out-of-doors. When spring begins to move in his bones, he just must get out again. Moreover, as civilization, cement pavements, office buildings, radios have overwhelmed us, the need for regeneration has increased, and the impulses are even stronger.","Self-government can succeed only through an instructed electorate.","The pause between the errors and trials of the day and the hopes of the night.","The thing I enjoyed most were visits from children. They did not want public office.","If the law is upheld only by government officials, then all law is at an end.","One civilization after another has been wrecked upon the attempt to secure sufficient leadership from a single group or class.","Freedom conceives that the mind and spirit of man can be free only if he be free to pattern his own life, to develop his own talents, free to earn, to spend, to save, to acquire property as the security of his old age and his family.","At 17, I went to Stanford University to study engineering. My time was occupied with the required reading and the extracurricular duties of managing the baseball and football teams and earning my way.","Let me remind you that credit is the lifeblood of business, the lifeblood of prices and jobs.","Once upon a time my political opponents honored me as possessing the fabulous intellectual and economic power by which I created a worldwide depression all by myself.","Words without actions are the assassins of idealism.","Many years ago, I concluded that a few hair shirts were part of the mental wardrobe of every man. The president differs from other men in that he has a more extensive wardrobe.","America - a great social and economic experiment, noble in motive and far-reaching in purpose.","With impressive proof on all sides of magnificent progress, no one can rightly deny the fundamental correctness of our economic system.","Peace can be contributed to by respect for our ability in defense.","Engineering training deals with the exact sciences. That sort of exactness makes for truth and conscience. It might be good for the world if more men had that sort of mental start in life even if they did not pursue the profession.","The Ritz Hotel has never yet provided game of such wondrous flavor as the bird plucked and half-cooked over the small boys' camp fire.","My earliest realization of the stir of national life was the torch parade in the Garfield campaign. On that occasion, I was not only allowed out that night, but I saw the lamps being filled and lighted.","I am no supporter of factory labor for children, but I have never joined with those who clamored against proper work of children on farms outside their school hours.","Upon the farm of the uncle with whom I lived, we did know of the mortgage as some dreadful damper on youthful hopes of things that could not be bought. I do have a vivid recollection that the major purpose of a farm was to produce a living right on the spot for the family.","A whole people with the ballot in their hands possess the most conclusive and unlimited power ever entrusted to humanity.","True liberal government is founded on the emancipation of men.","Free government is the most difficult of all government. But it is everlastingly true that the plain people will make fewer mistakes than any other group of men, no matter how powerful.","We must have government that builds stamina into communities and men. That makes men instead of mendicants.","America means far more than a continent bounded by two oceans. It is more than pride of military power, glory in war, or in victory. It means more than vast expanse of farms, of great factories or mines, magnificent cities, or millions of automobiles and radios.","The opportunities of America opened out to me the public schools. They carried me to the professional training of an American university.

It is the direct measure of man's spiritual vision.","It does not seem that the contradiction which exists between the aristocratic function of art and the democratic structure of modern society can ever be resolved.","I can imagine no society which does not embody some method of arbitration.","Progress is measured by the degree of differentiation within a society.","The farther a society progresses, the more clearly the individual becomes the antithesis of the group.","The sensitive artist knows that a bitter wind is blowing.","The only sin is ugliness, and if we believed this with all our being, all other activities of the human spirit could be left to take care of themselves.","The modern work of art, as I have said, is a symbol.","The characteristic political attitude of today is not one of positive belief, but of despair.","Nobody seriously believes in the social philosophies of the immediate past.","There are a few people, but a diminishing number, who still believe that Marxism, as an economic system, off era a coherent alternative to capitalism, and socialism has, indeed, triumphed in one country.","Man is everywhere still in chains.","To realize that new world we must prefer the values of freedom and equality above all other values - above personal wealth, technical power and nationalism.","The sense of historical continuity, and a feeling for philosophical rectitude cannot, however, be compromised.","I know of no better name than Anarchism.","In the evolution of mankind there has always been a certain degree of social coherence.","These groups within a society can he distinguished according as to whether, like an army or an orchestra, they function as a single body; or whether they are united merely to defend their common interests and otherwise function as separate individuals.","The point I am making is that in the more primitive forms of society the individual is merely a unit; in more developed forms of society he is an independent personality.","If the individual is a unit in a corporate mass, his life is not merely brutish and short, but dull and mechanical.","You might think that it would he the natural desire of every man to develop as an independent personality, but this does not seem to be true.","The slave may be happy, but happiness is not enough.","But the further step, by means of which a civilization is given its quality or culture, is only attained by a process of cellular division, in the course of which the individual is differentiated, made distinct from and independent of the parent group.","I have not the slightest doubt that this form of individuation represents a higher stage in the evolution of mankind.","It was Nietzsche who first made us conscious of the significance of the individual as a term in the evolutionary process-in that part of the evolutionary process which has still to take place.","Creeds and castes, and all forms of intellectual and emotional grouping, belong to the past.","Freud has shown one thing very clearly: that we only forget our infancy by burying it in the unconscious; and that the problems of this difficult period find their solution under a disguised form in adult life.","Morality, as has often been pointed out, is antecedent to religion-it even exists in a rudimentary form among animals.","My own early experiences in war led me to suspect the value of discipline, even in that sphere where it is so often regarded as the first essential for success.","The principle of equity first came into evidence in Roman jurisprudence and was derived by analogy from the physical meaning of the word.","I am not going to claim that modern anarchism has any direct relation to Roman jurisprudence; but I do claim that it has its basis in the laws of nature rather than in the state of nature.","What I do deny is that you can build any enduring society without some such mystical ethos.","It is already clear, after twenty years of socialism in Russia, that if you do not provide your society with a new religion, it will gradually revert to the old one.","We may be sure that out of the ruins of our capitalist civilization a new religion will emerge, just as Christianity emerged from the ruins of the Roman civilization.","I call religion a natural authority, but it has usually been conceived as a supernatural authority.","The assumption is that the right kind of society is an organic being not merely analogous to an organic being, but actually a living structure with appetites and digestions, instincts and passions, intelligence and reason."],"Herbert Samuel":["A library is thought in cold storage.","It is easy to be tolerant of the principles of other people if you have none of your own.","An autobiography is the story of how a man thinks he lived.","He suffered from a rush of words to the head.","The virtue of some people consists wholly in condemning the vices in others.","It takes two to make a marriage a success and only one to make it a failure."],"Herbert Simon":["One finds limits by pushing them.","One of the first rules of science is if somebody delivers a secret weapon to you, you better use it.","What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.","The proper study of mankind is the science of design.","The social sciences, I thought, needed the same kind of rigor and the same mathematical underpinnings that had made the 'hard' sciences so brilliantly successful.","I don't care how big and fast computers are, they're not as big and fast as the world.","All correct reasoning is a grand system of tautologies, but only God can make direct use of that fact.","Human beings, viewed as behaving systems, are quite simple. The apparent complexity of our behavior over time is largely a reflection of the complexity of the environment in which we find ourselves.","Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones.","Human knowledge has been changing from the word go and people in certain respects behave more rationally than they did when they didn't have it. They spend less time doing rain dances and more time seeding clouds.","Engineering, medicine, business, architecture and painting are concerned not with the necessary but with the contingent - not with how things are but with how they might be - in short, with design.","There are no morals about technology at all. Technology expands our ways of thinking about things, expands our ways of doing things. If we're bad people we use technology for bad purposes and if we're good people we use it for good purposes.","Technology may create a condition, but the questions are what do we do about ourselves. We better understand ourselves pretty clearly and we better find ways to like ourselves.","The world is vast, beautiful, and fascinating, even awe-inspiring - but impersonal. It demands nothing of me, and allows me to demand nothing of it.","No one has characterized market mechanisms better than Friedrich von Hayek.","Learning is any change in a system that produces a more or less permanent change in its capacity for adapting to its environment.","In the computer field, the moment of truth is a running program; all else is prophecy.","The engineer, and more generally the designer, is concerned with how things ought to be - how they ought to be in order to attain goals, and to function.","Forget about Nobel prizes; they aren't really very important.","Anything that gives us new knowledge gives us an opportunity to be more rational.","Maybe we ought to have a world in which things are divided between people kind of fairly.","Most of us really aren't horribly unique. There are 6 billion of us. Put 'em all in one room and very few would stand out as individuals. So maybe we ought to think of worth in terms of our ability to get along as a part of nature, rather than being the lords over nature."],"Herbert Spencer":["The wise man must remember that while he is a descendant of the past, he is a parent of the future.","The great aim of education is not knowledge but action.","Life is the continuous adjustment of internal relations to external relations.","The more specific idea of Evolution now reached is - a change from an indefinite, incoherent homogeneity to a definite, coherent heterogeneity, accompanying the dissipation of motion and integration of matter.","Love is life's end, but never ending. Love is life's wealth, never spent, but ever spending. Love's life's reward, rewarded in rewarding.","How often misused words generate misleading thoughts.","Marriage: a ceremony in which rings are put on the finger of the lady and through the nose of the gentleman.","Divine right of kings means the divine right of anyone who can get uppermost.","No one can be perfectly free till all are free; no one can be perfectly moral till all are moral; no one can be perfectly happy till all are happy.","Our lives are universally shortened by our ignorance.","Who indeed, after pulling off the coloured glasses of prejudice and thrusting out of sight his pet projects, can help seeing the folly of these endeavours to protect men against themselves? A sad population of imbeciles would our schemers fill the world with, could their plans last.","Hero-worship is strongest where there is least regard for human freedom.","Be bold, be bold, and everywhere be bold.","We all decry prejudice, yet are all prejudiced.","The Republican form of government is the highest form of government: but because of this it requires the highest type of human nature, a type nowhere at present existing.","All socialism involves slavery.","What a cage is to the wild beast, law is to the selfish man.","Marriage: A word which should be pronounced 'mirage'.","Government is essentially immoral.","When a man's knowledge is not in order, the more of it he has the greater will be his confusion.","Society exists for the benefit of its members, not the members for the benefit of society.","A living thing is distinguished from a dead thing by the multiplicity of the changes at any moment taking place in it.","The ultimate result of shielding men from the effects of folly, is to fill the world with fools.","Music must take rank as the highest of the fine arts - as the one which, more than any other, ministers to the human spirit.","Civilization is a progress from an indefinite, incoherent homogeneity toward a definite, coherent heterogeneity.","The preservation of health is a duty. Few seem conscious that there is such a thing as physical morality.","A jury is composed of twelve men of average ignorance.","In science the important thing is to modify and change one's ideas as science advances.","Those who have never entered upon scientific pursuits know not a tithe of the poetry by which they are surrounded.","An argument fatal to the communist theory, is suggested by the fact, that a desire for property is one of the elements of our nature.","Old forms of government finally grow so oppressive that they must be thrown off even at the risk of reigns of terror.","We do not commonly see in a tax a diminution of freedom, and yet it clearly is one.","Objects we ardently pursue bring little happiness when gained; most of our pleasures come from unexpected sources.","Science is organized knowledge.","Every cause produces more than one effect.","Volumes might be written upon the impiety of the pious.","Education has for its object the formation of character.","Opinion is ultimately determined by the feelings, and not by the intellect.","The behavior of men to the lower animals, and their behavior to each other, bear a constant relationship.","People are beginning to see that the first requisite to success in life is to be a good animal.","The fact disclosed by a survey of the past that majorities have been wrong must not blind us to the complementary fact that majorities have usually not been entirely wrong."],"Herbert V. Prochnow":["The trouble with opportunity is that it always comes disguised as hard work.","A city is a large community where people are lonesome together.","A visitor from Mars could easily pick out the civilized nations. They have the best implements of war.","A great many people mistake opinions for thought.","You may be sorry that you spoke, sorry you stayed or went, sorry you won or lost, sorry so much was spent. But as you go through life, you'll find - you're never sorry you were kind.","When better business decisions are made, economists won't make them.","You never have to know all the answers because you won't be asked all the questions.","If you are ignorant, you certainly can get into some interesting arguments.","The fellow who never makes a mistake takes his orders from one who does.","There is a time when we must firmly choose the course which we will follow or the endless drift of events will make the decision for us."],"Herbie Hancock":["One thing that sticks in my mind is that jazz means freedom and openness. It's a music that, although it developed out of the African American experience, speaks more about the human experience than the experience of a particular people.","It's not exclusive, but inclusive, which is the whole spirit of jazz.","Forget about trying to compete with someone else. Create your own pathway. Create your own new vision.","I think risk-taking is a great adventure. And life should be full of adventures.","It's part of life to have obstacles. It's about overcoming obstacles; that's the key to happiness.","I've had a life that has taken many interesting paths. I've learned a lot from mentors who were instrumental in shaping me, and I want to share what I've learned.","I'm always interested in looking forward toward the future. Carving out new ways of looking at things.","World peace is no longer some pie-in-the-sky thing, because no single person or country is going to solve it on their own.","Since time is a continuum, the moment is always different, so the music is always different.","Globalization means we have to re-examine some of our ideas, and look at ideas from other countries, from other cultures, and open ourselves to them. And that's not comfortable for the average person.","Jazz is about being in the moment.","One of the most important functions of jazz has been to encourage a hope for freedom, for people living in situations of intolerance or struggle.","The spirit of jazz is the spirit of openness.","You make different colors by combining those colors that already exist.","Music happens to be an art form that transcends language.","All you have to do is play one note. But it needs to be the right note.","I've been curious ever since I was a little kid.","We need to move into a culture of peace. What I hope to promote is the idea that we all need each other and that the greatest happiness in life is not how much we have but how much we give. That's a wealth that's priceless. You can't buy compassion.","I think there's a great beauty to having problems. That's one of the ways we learn.","The value of music is not dazzling yourself and others with technique.","Sometimes you have to create a vision, a path for a vision. It may not be apparent, and you may have to forge it yourself. And that will be the way to move your life forward.","The value of music is to be able to play one note at the right time in the right way.","When I was six, my best friend's parents bought him a piano. My mother noticed that every time I would go to his house, the first thing I would say to him was 'Levester' - His name was Levester - I said, 'Levester, can I go play your piano?' So, on my 7th birthday, my parents bought me a piano.","It's easy to get sidetracked with technology, and that is the danger, but ultimately you have to see what works with the music and what doesn't. In a lot of cases, less is more. In most cases, less is more.","I've always been interested in science. I used to take watches apart and clocks apart, and there's little screws, and a little this and that, and I found out if I dropped one of them, that thing ain't gonna work.","Take whatever happens and try to make it work.","One of the greatest experiences I ever had was listening to a conversation with Joni Mitchell and Wayne Shorter. Just to hear them talking, my mouth was open. They understand each other perfectly, and they make these leaps and jumps because they don't have to explain anything.","I like to present something that the people haven't seen or haven't heard before. Otherwise they might as well just stay home and play the record.","Being vulnerable is allowing yourself to trust. That's hard for a lot of people to do. They feel a lot more secure if they kind of put walls around themselves. Then they don't have to trust anybody but themselves.","I think people have learned that Herbie Hancock can be defined as someone that you won't be able to figure out what he's going to do next. The sky is the limit as far as I'm concerned.","In World War II, jazz absolutely was the music of freedom, and then in the Cold War, behind the Iron Curtain, same thing. It was all underground, but they needed the food of freedom that jazz offered.","Each human being exists because there's something they have to offer for the evolution of the universe that only they can fulfill.","Jazz has borrowed from other genres of music and also has lent itself to other genres of music.","But I have to be careful not to let the world dazzle me so much that I forget that I'm a husband and a father.","The thing that we possess, that machines don't, is the ability to exhibit wisdom.","Being a musician is what I do, but it's not what I am.","But, the truth is that everyone is somebody already.","Creativity and artistic endeavors have a mission that goes far beyond just making music for the sake of music.","Creativity shouldn't be following radio; it should be the other way around.","Getting the Oscar had the biggest impression on me.","I feel a lot more secure about the directions I take, than I might have, had I not practiced Buddhism.","I think I was supposed to play jazz.","I try stuff. I synthesize what's of value with some of the other things I have at my disposal.","I try to practice with my life.","I'm always looking to create new avenues or new visions of music.","I've been a religious, spiritual person for a long time.","In the past, there's always been one leader that has led the pack to development of the music.","It is people's hearts that move the age.","It pulled me like a magnet, jazz did, because it was a way that I could express myself.","It's not the style that motivates me, as much as an attitude of openness that I have when I go into a project.","Miles' sessions were not typical of anybody else's sessions. They were totally unique.","Music is the tool to express life - and all that makes a difference.","Nobody told me I was a child prodigy.","One thing I like about jazz is that it emphasized doing things differently from what other people were doing.","One thing that attracted me to Buddhism was the support for this larger vision of values.","See, there were certain rules I'd always used, and people like Trane, they would break those rules.","The music becomes something that is its own entity.","We are eternally linked not just to each other but our environment.","When I was coming up, I practiced all the time because I thought if I didn't I couldn't do my best.","When I was in my early teens, I remember coming to the conclusion that your life never ends.","While knowledge may provide useful point of reference, it cannot become a force to guide the future.","Without wisdom, the future has no meaning, no valuable purpose.","You can practice to attain knowledge, but you can't practice to attain wisdom.","You can practice to learn a technique, but I'm more interested in conceiving of something in the moment.","You would not exist if you did not have something to bring to the table of life.","I hope that I can make good music out of whatever genre I go into. Just to prove to myself that I can.","I'm not special, no more special than anybody else.","My father was really good with math. It's a funny thing, I don't remember my father or my mother being so mechanical-minded. My father always wanted to be a doctor, but he came from a really poor family in Georgia, and there was no way he was going to be a doctor.","Music is not the only reason that I practice Buddhism anymore because it has affected my whole life.","I don't view myself as a musician anymore - I view myself as a human being that functions as a musician when I'm functioning as a musician, but that's not 24 hours a day. That's really opened me up to even more perspectives because now I look at music, not from the standpoint of being a musician, but from the standpoint of being a human being.","Buddhism has turned me on to my humanness, and is challenging my humanness so that I can become more human.","Back in the day for me was a great time in my life - I was in my 20s. Most people refer to their experiences in their twenties as being a highlight in their life. It's a period of time where you often develop your own way, your own sound, your own identity, and that happened with me, when I was with a great teacher - Miles Davis.","I've never really been interested in doing a solo piano tour.","I like to be on the edge, on the cutting edge, or be into the unknown, into the territory where I have to depend on being in the moment and depending on my instincts.","It's not easy to play in a framework that requires simplicity and to tastefully find ways to interject the kind of freedom that we have in playing jazz.","Most people define themselves by what they do - 'I'm a musician.' Then one day it occurred to me that I'm only a musician when I'm playing music - or writing music, or talking about music. I don't do that 24 hours a day. I'm also a father, a son, a husband, a citizen - I mean, when I go to vote, I'm not thinking of myself as 'a musician.'","I got a chance to work with Miles Davis, and that changed everything for me, 'cause Miles really encouraged all his musicians to reach beyond what they know, go into unknown territory and explore. It's made a difference to me and the decisions that I've made over the years about how to approach a project in this music.","My first Grammy wasn't even in a jazz category, but of course I was really excited. 'Rockit' was the beginning of kind of a new era for the whole hip-hop movement.","Hip-hop is all over the planet.","The strongest thing that any human being has going is their own integrity and their own heart. As soon as you start veering away from that, the solidity that you need in order to be able to stand up for what you believe in and deliver what's really inside, it's just not going to be there.","I hope to use dialogue and culture as a means of bringing people of various cultures together, and using that as a way to resolve conflict.","At a certain point, I became a kind of musician that has tunnel vision about jazz. I only listened to jazz and classical music.","I just express myself in any way I feel is appropriate at the moment.","As a human being, I'm concerned about the world that I live in. So, I'm concerned about peace. I'm concerned about - about man's inhumanity to man. I'm concerned about the environment.","I don't go around, the way many musicians do, with earbuds in my ear listening to my iPod all day and just sticking my head in the music all the time.","I am not fundamentally a musician, I am fundamentally a human being.","It's part of my nature. I get excited when trying out new stuff, whether it be an idea or equipment. It stimulates my juices.","We need to put into practice the idea of embracing other cultures. We need to be shaping the kind of world we want to live in instead of waiting for someone else or some other entities to do it for us.","To my wife, I'm not Herbie Hancock the musician. I'm her husband. When I'm talking to a neighbor, I'm a neighbor. When I vote, I'm a citizen.","My hope is that the music will serve as a metaphor for the actions taken by the inhabitants of this wonderful planet as a call for world harmony on all levels.","Music truly is the universal language.","The Internet opens up a whole new range of possibilities in a wide range of areas.","I don't see how we can have both the freedoms we had before and the safety net that we all need considering the way the world is today. And that's just because human beings can't trust each other. We've given in over and over to some of the darkest elements that exist in life itself.","So much of what I create has been due to the influence of Miles Davis and Donald Byrd, and so many of those that have passed on. Their music, their legacy lives on with the rest of us because we are so highly influenced by their experience and what they have given us.","I've been practising Buddhism for forty years, and that's what has led me to this path of discovering my own humanity and recognizing the humanity in others.","When you talk about 'doing the work', that's the work I'm interested in. What can I contribute as a human being?","Clare Fischer was a major influence on my harmonic concept. He and Bill Evans, and Ravel and Gil Evans, finally. You know, that's where it really came from. Almost all of the harmony that I play can be traced to one of those four people and whoever their influences were.","The cool thing is that jazz is really a wonderful example of the great characteristics of Buddhism and great characteristics of the human spirit. Because in jazz we share, we listen to each other, we respect each other, we are creating in the moment. At our best, we're non-judgmental.","I like the idea of an eclectic approach, incorporating jazz with other forms and other genres of music.","I started off with classical music, and I got into jazz when I was about 14 years old. And I've been playing jazz ever since.","When the suggestion was made that I might consider doing music of Joni Mitchell, I thought it was a fantastic idea. Joni, I admire not only for her music but for her person, because she's a person that really stands out for what she believes in.","I'm one of the people who was a pioneer in encouraging musicians, early in the game, to get interested in technology, and now all the musicians are getting into it."],"Herbie Mann":["Being stubborn has helped, being selfish is not a bad thing.","Being selfish to me means that you have to look out for yourself and you don't have to sacrifice.","For me Brazilian music is the perfect mix of melody and rhythm. It just bubbles rhythmically. If I had to pick just one music style to play if would be Brazilian.","But when I first got cancer, after the initial shock and the fear and paranoia and crying and all that goes with cancer - that word means to most people ultimate death - I decided to see what I could do to take that negative and use it in a positive way.","By the time I'm 90, I hope to have it together.","I always say, if you keep your head in the sand, you don't know where the kick's coming from.","I had sat in one day in Central Park with Bonnie and Delaney, and Duane was playing with them, so I asked if he wanted to work on an album. You never had to say to him how to play the guitar.","I loved the Brazilian music I played. But this is finally me. For the first time I think it's really me.","I recently formed a foundation to raise awareness for prostate cancer. I feel it's very necessary that men be more aware about prostate cancer and their health in general.","I was raised in Brooklyn, and I lived there for 59 years.","If you want to play somebody's music, you'd better go into his house.","Music allows the great opportunity to play with people who turned you on and you love.","My ego is controlled enough that I don't have to be the focus.","My father's father came from Russia; my mother came from Romania.","My youngest son, who is now the drummer in my band, lives in Brooklyn. My oldest son is about to move out to California, and my daughters are both out of town.","One of the advantages of not having a record contract is that you can make your own mistakes, you don't need somebody else to organize them for you.","The music we're playing now is based on my heritage, which is Russian, Romanian and Hungarian.","The reality is that what you find out is that your head is the medicine. If your head is not in the right place and you don't think positively, all the medicine technology in the world is not going to work.","Think about it: Look at the strides of awareness and treatment and tests that women have had with breast cancer, that the gay community has had with AIDS, because they're active and they talk about it.","To most jazz critics I was basically Kenny G.","What I try to do is produce an atmosphere where musicians want to invest in what they do and give to the recording. I hire those musicians who I know will play something creative and interesting.","When you get cancer, it's like really time to look at what your life was and is, and I decided that everything I've done so far is not as important as what I'm going to do now.","Why do you have to retire at 65? Why can't you start at 70? You know, like wine. Why can't music be that way? My new band, we're playing stuff that's never been done before.","You don't have to live the blues to play the blues.","You have to be concerned with yourself because if you're not on it all the time, nobody else is going to be."],"Herman Cain":["One of the things that I did before I ran for president is I was a professional speaker. Not a motivational speaker - an inspirational speaker. Motivation comes from within. You have to be inspired. That's what I do. I inspire people, I inspire the public, I inspire my staff. I inspired the organizations I took over to want to succeed.","In order to fix Social Security, we must restructure it so that we continue to provide for our Nation's seniors that are approaching retirement age, but allow for younger taxpayers to invest a portion of their Social Security taxes in private accounts.","Whether you were talking about Pillsbury, Burger King, Godfather's, the National Restaurant Association, in each one of those situations, I had a daunting problem that I had to solve. And I used the same business principles to approach the problem and, more importantly, solve the problem in every one of the situations.","Don't blame Wall Street, don't blame the big banks. If you don't have a job and you are not rich, blame yourself!","Most of the ancestors that I can trace were born here in the United States of America. And then it goes back to slavery. And I'm sure my ancestors go all the way back to Africa, but I feel more of an affinity for America than I do for Africa. I'm a black man in America.","The endorsement process is an evolution. What you try to do is you endorse someone that you believe in and their ideas and their solutions align with yours.","Stupid people are ruining America.","My presence in the social media and on the Internet is much bigger than many of the other candidates, including Mitt Romney. So, when you take the social media and you take the Tea Party citizens movement, you have a combination there that, quite frankly, 10 years ago, I wouldn't have had a chance.","My approach to cutting spending as president, is to do a ten percent across the board cut of all federal agencies, and then ask each of my new agency heads to find another ten percent by drilling down. That's what you do in business to come up with approximately 20 percent cuts for the first fiscal year budget.","One right decision doth not a great president make.","The 9-9-9 plan would resuscitate this economy because it replaces the outdated tax code that allows politicians to pick winners and losers, and to provide favors in the form of tax breaks, special exemptions and loopholes. It simplifies the code dramatically: 9% business flat tax, 9% personal flat tax, 9% sales tax.","If I had been under ObamaCare, and a beaurocrat had been trying to tell me when I could get that CT scan, that would have delayed my treatment. I was able to get the treatment as fast as I could based upon my timetable, and not the government's timetable. That's what saved my life.","The American people, Neil, are sick and tired of excuses. They are sick and tired of the blame game. And they're sick and tired of the deception coming from this president and this administration. This is why I believe that I am doing so well in the polls.","One of the questions that I often get is, 'Why are you running to be President?'. To Be President! What did I miss? I'm not running to go to Disneyland.","I do not believe abortion should be legal.","I was Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. As you know, there are twelve banks and they have their citizens board, and I got elected to the Fed Chairmanship for the Federal Reserve Kansas City Bank back in the mid-'90s. It might have been 1995-'96.","Polls are inaccurate in my opinion, based upon anecdotal evidence, based upon people that I know.","Nobody motivates today's workers. If it doesn't come from within, it doesn't come. Fun helps remove the barriers that allow people to motivate themselves.","My motivation for running for Senate was not for the stature of being a senator, but because I wanted to make a difference on issues I feel passionate about.","Americans need accurate information in order to consider Social Security reform. Too bad the media can't be counted upon to provide it.","I didn't know I was a conservative when it didn't matter to me growing up.","The one thing that the President can do is to establish a real energy independence plan. We have all the recources we need right here in this country to establish energy independence if we had the leadership.","If the world market believed that we were serious about energy independence and we were going to utilize all of our own existing resources, the speculators would stop speculating up they start speculating down as we get our own oil out of the ground.","It's time to get real, folks. Hope and change ain't working. Hope and change is not a solution. Hope and change is not a job.","The past several months I have been able to meet with people across this country. One thing is clear: America craves for real solutions to the problems we face. That's why I'm running for President of the United States.","Most of the people who are in elective office in Washington, D.C., they have held public office before. How's that workin' for you?","Spending time at the Federal Reserve was a good learning opportunity for me. It helped me to understand economic philosophies and polices that I had not previously known about.","I started at Pillsbury as a manager in one of their analysis functions, then worked my way up the corporate ladder to become vice president. Moving to Burger King was an important moment in my career.","People who oppose Obama are said to be racists - so I guess I'm a racist.","I'm not a professional politician. I'm a professional problem solver, and I believe we should cut the salaries of senators and congressmen 10 percent until they balance the budget. I call that conservative common sense.","The thing that differs me from a lot of other people running for the President of the United States is that I focus on the problem first. Then I focus on what the solution is.","They call me racist too just because I disagree with a President who happens to be black. You are not racists - you are patriots.","I am an American. Black. Conservative. I don't use African-American, because I'm American, I'm black and I'm conservative. I don't like people trying to label me. African- American is socially acceptable for some people, but I am not some people.","The only tactic liberals have is to try to intimidate people into thinking that the Tea Party is racist.

Fifty per cent of taxpayers pay 97 per cent of the taxes. By most people's standards, that's already fair. The President is playing the class warfare card because he knows that a lot of people may never hear that particular fact.

For example, the EPA has a rule that is going to be implemented Jan. 1, 2012, where they're going to begin to regulate dust. That's right, dust. It's called PM 2.5. That is focusing on the wrong thing.","African-Americans have been brainwashed into not being open-minded, not even considering a conservative point of view. I have received some of that same vitriol simply because I am running for the Republican nomination as a conservative. So it's just brainwashing and people not being open-minded, pure and simple.","This whole notion that all African-Americans are not going to vote for Obama is not necessarily true. I believe a third would vote for me, based on my own anecdotal feedback.

This is the ultimate solution, not to just say we're going to trim around the edges, not to say that we will try to simplify a little of this and a little of that. The problem is, replace the tax code, so we can establish tax fairness for everybody.","We need to lower tax rates for everybody, starting with the top corporate tax rate. We need to simplify the tax code. The ultimate answer, in my opinion, is the fair tax, which is a fair tax for everybody, because as long as we still have this messed-up tax code, the politicians are going to use it to reward winners and losers.","That's the biggest problem, is the tax code itself.","I would have to have people totally committed to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of this United States.

Though often terrible, they are not as appalling as they were there.","This is the absolute truth: and on this truth our tactics must be based. All tactics that are not based on this are false, and lead the proletariat to terrible defeat.","What does it mean with regard to tactics, this fact that the proletariat of Western Europe stands all alone: that it has no prospect of any help whatsoever from any other class?","You should not do this, Comrade. We are only in the introductory stage yet, here in Western Europe. And in that stage it is better to encourage the fighters than the rulers.","And it is practically the same in the case of the four or five million poor peasants in France, and also for Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, and two of the Scandinavian countries. Everywhere small and medium sized industry prevails.","As farmers or owners, the poor peasants possess a piece of land. The excellent means of transport enables them often to sell their goods. At the very worst they can mostly provide their own food.","Because in Russia you were able to triumph with the help of a large class of poor peasants, you represent things in such a way, as if we in Western Europe are also going to have that help.","But the question is to find and rear leaders that are really one with the masses. This can only be accomplished by the masses, the political parties and the Trade Unions, by means of the most severe struggle, also inwardly.","Of course you know this difference as well as I do, only you failed to draw from it the conclusions for the tactics in Western Europe, at least as far as I am able to judge from your works.","The revolution in Russia was terrible for the proletariat in the long years of its development and it is terrible now, after the victory. But at the actual time of revolution it was easy, and this was due to the peasants.","The revolution in Russia was victorious with the help of the poor peasants. This should always be borne in mind here in Western Europe and all the world over. But the workers in Western Europe stand alone: this should never be forgotten in Russia.","To judge from all Communist papers, magazines and brochures, and from all public assemblies, one might even surmise that a revolt of the poor peasants in Western Europe might break out at any moment!"],"Herman Hesse":["It was as if all of the happiness, all of the magic of this blissful hour had flowed together into these stirring, bittersweet tones and flowed away, becoming temporal and transitory once more.","Wisdom is nothing but a preparation of the soul, a capacity, a secret art of thinking, feeling and breathing thoughts of unity at every moment of life.","If time is not real, then the dividing line between this world and eternity, between suffering and bliss, between good and evil, is also an illusion.","It was morning; through the high window I saw the pure, bright blue of the sky as it hovered cheerfully over the long roofs of the neighboring houses. It too seemed full of joy, as if it had special plans, and had put on its finest clothes for the occasion.","Until 1914 I loved to travel; I often went to Italy and once spent a few months in India. Since then I have almost entirely abandoned travelling, and I have not been outside of Switzerland for over ten years.","In Germany I have been acknowledged again since the fall of Hitler, but my works, partly suppressed by the Nazis and partly destroyed by the war; have not yet been republished there.","Nevertheless, whether in occurrences lasting days, hours or mere minutes at a time, I have experienced happiness often, and have had brief encounters with it in my later years, even in old age.","The world is not imperfect or slowly evolving along a path to perfection. No, it is perfect at every moment, every sin already carries grace in it.","Writing is good, thinking is better. Cleverness is good, patience is better.","Among the letters my readers write me, there is a certain category which is continuously growing, and which I see as a symptom of the increasing intellectualization of the relationship between readers and literature.","But your questions, which are unanswerable without exception, all spring from the same erroneous thinking.","It is not Kafka's fault that his wonderful writings have lately turned into a fad, and are read by people who have neither the ability nor the desire to absorb literature.","For me, however, that beloved, glowing little word happiness has become associated with everything I have felt since childhood upon hearing the sound of the word itself.","When trying to remember my share in the glow of the eternal present, in the smile of God, I return to my childhood, too, for that is where the most significant discoveries turn up.","This happiness consisted of nothing else but the harmony of the few things around me with my own existence, a feeling of contentment and well-being that needed no changes and no intensification.","It was still quiet in the house, and not a sound was heard from outside, either. Were it not for this silence, my reverie would probably have been disrupted by reminders of daily duties, of getting up and going to school.","I was out of my bed in one second, trembling with excitement, and I dashed to the door and into the adjoining room, where I could watch the streets below from the windows.","Love of God is not always the same as love of good.","Seeking means: to have a goal; but finding means: to be free, to be receptive, to have no goal.","The marvel of the Bhagavad-Gita is its truly beautiful revelation of life's wisdom which enables philosophy to blossom into religion."],"Herman J.

They reject, sometimes very emotionally, any attempts to analyze this notion.","Human and moral factors must always be considered. They must never be missing from policies and from public discussion.","To the extent that these advanced weapons or their components are treated as articles of commerce, perhaps for peaceful uses as in the Plowshare program, their cost would be well within the resources available to many large private organizations.","The widespread diffusion of nuclear weapons would make many nations able, and in some cases also create the pressure, to aggravate an on-going crisis, or even touch off a war between two other powers for purposes of their own.","The objective of nuclear-weapons policy should not be solely to decrease the number of weapons in the world, but to make the world safer - which is not necessarily the same thing.","A total nuclear freeze is counterproductive - especially now, when technology is rapidly changing and the Soviets have some important strategic advantages.","My guess is that nuclear weapons will be used sometime in the next hundred years, but that their use is much more likely to be small and limited than widespread and unconstrained.","Nuclear weapons are intrinsically neither moral nor immoral, though they are more prone to immoral use than most weapons.","Anything that reduces war-related destruction should not be considered altogether immoral.","It is immoral from almost any point of view to refuse to defend yourself and others from very grave and terrible threats, even as there are limits to the means that can be used in such defense.","A healthy and fully functioning society must allocate its resources among a variety of competing interests, all of which are more or less valid but none of which should take precedence over national security.","Only those who are ideologically opposed to military programs think of the defense budget as the first and best place to get resources for social welfare needs.","New developments in weapon systems during the 1950s and early 1960s created a situation that was most dangerous, and even conducive to accidental war.","There was no race - but to the extent that there was an arms competition, it was almost entirely on the Soviet side, first to catch up and then to surpass the Americans.","Projecting a persuasive image of a desirable and practical future is extremely important to high morale, to dynamism, to consensus, and in general to help the wheels of society turn smoothly.","For if enough people were really convinced that growth should be halted, and if they acted on that conviction, then billions of others might be deprived of any realistic hope of gaining the opportunities now enjoyed by the more fortunate.","A surprising number of government committees will make important decisions on fundamental matters with less attention than each individual would give to buying a suit."],"Herman Melville":["I am, as I am; whether hideous, or handsome, depends upon who is made judge.","It is better to fail in originality than to succeed in imitation.","A smile is the chosen vehicle of all ambiguities.","Friendship at first sight, like love at first sight, is said to be the only truth.","A whale ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.","Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.","There is a touch of divinity even in brutes, and a special halo about a horse, that should forever exempt him from indignities.","There is no dignity in wickedness, whether in purple or rags; and hell is a democracy of devils, where all are equals.","We cannot live only for ourselves.

These were learned by heart on the first day with less than half of the repetitions necessary for the shortest of the syllable series.","Out of the simple consonants of the alphabet and our eleven vowels and diphthongs all possible syllables of a certain sort were constructed, a vowel sound being placed between two consonants.","Ideas which have been developed simultaneously or in immediate succession in the same mind mutually reproduce each other, and do this with greater ease in the direction of the original succession and with a certainty proportional to the frequency with which they were together.","Meanwhile the fact that the connection with the activity of memory in ordinary life is for the moment lost is of less importance than the reverse, namely, that this connection with the complications and fluctuations of life is necessarily still a too close one.","Mental states of every kind, - sensations, feelings, ideas, - which were at one time present in consciousness and then have disappeared from it, have not with their disappearance absolutely ceased to exist.","On the basis of the familiar experience that that which is learned with difficulty is better retained, it would have been safe to prophesy such an effect from the greater number of repetitions.","One needs but to say that, in the case of an unfamiliar sequence of syllables, only about seven can be grasped in one act, but that with frequent repetition and gradually increasing familiarity with the series this capacity of consciousness may be increased.","Series of syllables which have been learned by heart, forgotten, and learned anew must be similar as to their inner conditions at the times when they can be recited.","The aim of the tests carried on with these syllable series was, by means of repeated audible perusal of the separate series, to so impress them that immediately afterward they could voluntarily be reproduced.","The constant flux and caprice of mental events do not admit of the establishment of stable experimental conditions.","The musician writes for the orchestra what his inner voice sings to him; the painter rarely relies without disadvantage solely upon the images which his inner eye presents to him; nature gives him his forms, study governs his combinations of them.","These syllables, about 2,300 in number, were mixed together and then drawn out by chance and used to construct series of different lengths, several of which each time formed the material for a test."],"Hermann Eilts":["My father had been in the German Diplomatic Service, and although he had been in the United States since World War II and out of diplomacy, it was something that was very much talked about in the family.

I'm already proud to have become the leading Austrian World Cup racer.","It was necessary to organize my career to remain at the top level until Salt Lake City.","It was really tough to race the GS a day after the downhill, but that's over now. I'm looking forward for the rest of the season which is also quite interesting.","It's funny to have become an elegant skier now. But my drive is still the same.","It's good to ski for fun, but I still want to win races as often as possible.","My attitude on skis is different now. I have learned to put less pressure on myself and on the edges of my skis when I'm racing, to be keep myself more under control.","One victory more or less doesn't make the difference for me now.","Ski racing, especially downhill, is a dangerous activity and there are many accidents. It would be really too bad to lose everything because of a crash.","The crowd is wonderful. There is always a superb atmosphere in the finish area. It's good for the World Cup. I missed it a lot when I had to rest and it's so nice to be back here.","There is no pressure on me, I can take a lot of risks in the coming weeks. I feel free to ski the way I decide on race-day because the overall title was not my main target this winter.","This time, I took it easier. I stood up before it so as not to crash again.","When I was a child, all I wanted was to enter the Austrian team and to compete on the World Cup tour. I had to fight hard to reach this. I wanted badly to win each race.","When you have won everything in your career, what's left? Why go on?"],"Hermann Oberth":["Our educational system is like an automobile which has strong rear lights, brightly illuminating the past.

This is the case, for instance, when we produce fire by striking flint against steel, or when an iron bar is worked for some time by powerful blows of the hammer.","I then endeavoured to show that it is more especially in the thorough conformity with law which natural phenomena and natural products exhibit, and in the comparative ease with which laws can be stated, that this difference exists.","Now, the external work of man is of the most varied kind as regards the force or ease, the form and rapidity, of the motions used on it, and the kind of work produced.","The law in question asserts, that the quantity of force which can be brought into action in the whole of Nature is unchangeable, and can neither be increased nor diminished.","The older view of the nature of heat was that it is a substance, very fine and imponderable indeed, but indestructible, and unchangeable in quantity, which is an essential fundamental property of all matter.","What appeared to the earlier physicists to be the constant quantity of heat is nothing more than the whole motive power of the motion of heat, which remains constant so long as it is not transformed into other forms of work, or results afresh from them.","Windmills, which are used in the great plains of Holland and North Germany to supply the want of falling water, afford another instance of the action of velocity.

And I try so many different things. I do a lot of different things. Because I think God has helped me to love myself. I know who God is, and I love God.","I don't worry about protein. I don't worry about all that. I'm from old school. I grew up in south Georgia. They didn't worry about cholesterol or protein. They went out and worked and lived a long time, so I don't put a lot of worries in my mind.","If you train hard, you'll not only be hard, you'll be hard to beat.","When I feel good about myself, things start happening for myself. When you look up, you go up.","Lets not push it under the rug, or push it to the side because, no matter what, it's going to keep coming up. You know, if you never deal with that dirt up under the carpet, it's going to get larger and larger, and it's going to keep coming up.","I never dreamed about being an actor, because that was out of reach. Coming from a small town that was big in farming, and also big in clothing factories, you don't dream about being a professional football player or an actor.","Believing that no one is better than the other. You know I grew up in the South. My senior year there was a very big racial tension.","As a born-again Christian, I believe God actively and directly influences me to action.","The hardest thing I had to overcome in life? I think racism. That's so difficult because I don't think anyone can ever understand it. It's not that people don't want to understand it, but they don't want to touch it.","MMA is my love.","P.E. was my life in school. Without it, I wouldn't be standing here. It gave me confidence when I was an overweight kid with a speech impediment.","All these older kids here, and I'm the only one from a town that's so small, if everyone breathed at the same time, you'd run out of oxygen. Man, there is nothing there.","Because my parents, growing up, they worked hard. Everyone in my family woke up early in the morning. I used to see my mother and my father go off to work, and come back and, no matter what, they had time for the kids.","Coming from a small town it was tough to dream big. When I grew up in a small town in Georgia, my biggest dream was one day to be able to go to Atlanta.","Football, that's just athletics. But in the business world - doing everything - people are competing. So you need good work ethics, and I think it helped me to develop good work ethics, being in a small town.","God, my parents, my wife. I don't have a lot of friends, because I'm always moving around. I don't drink, so I don't hang out in bars. But they've been very big in my life. Because they have helped to encourage me.","Growing up, I started developing confidence in what I felt. My parents helped me to believe in myself. I wasn't the best looking guy, I wasn't the best athlete in the world, but they made me feel good about myself.","I don't read a lot of the sports, because I think people sometimes either build it up, or you have this guy that hates sports that is going to write bad about it, so I figure I'm not going to read it. Because I'm not going to let him put an idea into my head.","I was a little different. I still say I'm a little different, because success to me is not having the most money, or having the biggest car or the biggest house.","I'd usually read the Bible a lot. Read little short Bible stories. And today, whenever I give speeches, I bring up a few of those Bible stories, because those are inspirations to me.","If I had to come up with something that just came to me, I think growing up in a small town, I want knowledge. I still think today, knowledge is one of the keys.","My favorite subject probably was math. I love math. Figures just intrigue me. I was really good at math. English probably was my worst subject. But I used to write a lot of poetry. I used to write poetry all the time.","That person has to be accountable for himself. I think that's what we have to do in society today is to be accountable for yourself. I think we have the tendency to always want to live someone else's life.","My God given talent is my ability to stick with training longer than anybody else.","When I started out as a little kid, I didn't say 'I just want to run football.' I wanted to be a great athlete.","I do this 'Walker shake.' You got to get knocked down many times, shake it off. Life is about ups and downs, and you got to keep standing up.","Without a doubt in my mind, I should be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. You look at my stats without my USFL stats, and I don't know how you can argue with that. Look at my combined yards. I'm not one to make excuses, so I'll play by their rules and not even count the USFL stats.","I told somebody once, 'You don't want the Herschel that plays football... babysitting your child. When I am competing, I am a totally different person.'","I was a fat little kid with a speech impediment. I used to get beat up, not just picked on.","I'm just not a guy that loves to eat. I love to work and love to work out. I think I go against all the nutritionists who say you need to do this or need to do that, so I'm one of the oddballs.","I just think I'm blessed. I love the Lord Jesus Christ. I have a great grandmother that passed away at 104 and two grandparents that passed away at 97 and 95, and they never worried about protein. They just enjoyed life, and that's what I'm doing.","Eat what you want to eat, but just be willing to pay the price. If you know you want to eat more cake or more cookies, be willing to work out a lil bit more. I think that's the problem people have is you want to eat bad, but yet you don't want to pay the price to work it off.","I started ballet in my early 20s. I studied for about ten years. Ballet is probably the one of the hardest things I've done, almost like MMA. People don't give it a lot of credit and think it's easy, but it's very difficult. For an athlete, you use muscles you really don't use, and ballet is something I really respect.","I wouldn't change anything about my past, because it's made me who I am today. You have to remember: You need to crack some eggs to make omelettes. And I did crack some eggs.","I told my mom the reason I started working out was because I wanted to break the necks of the people picking on me. I wanted to hurt them. I said I didn't want any teacher to put me down any more.","I had teachers who said I was not good enough. So, I said I will become good enough. So I became this guy who became obsessed to become good enough. Now I sit down and tell people who I was. Now, I say, 'Do you know who I am?'","We have the DNA of our Lord Jesus Christ.","I was determined to make Renaissance Man Food Services and Herschel's Famous 34 major players in a very tough industry.","I always said I wanted to be a great athlete, ever since I was an overweight little kid. I just love competing in any kind of athletics.","If you dedicate yourself to something, you can achieve it. It's simple, but it's true, and your age is just an excuse.","I want to prove to people who sit on a couch and don't do anything but criticize other people that, if you're a true athlete or martial artist, you're not old until you can't get up and walk around anymore.","MMA fighters are said to be some of the best athletes in the world. My plan at the age of 47 is to show the world I am still one of the best athletes as well.","One thing I've done in my life is train year-round to compete at anything, anything. I've got an invitation now to maybe be on the karate team for the Barcelona Olympics. I'm debating whether I want to do that. I just love to compete, and I want to win.","If you eat a chicken wing or a chicken tender in some parts of the country, I probably supplied it.","Our responsibility in life is not to lie around and wait for things to happen. Our responsibility in life is to work. Life is getting out and getting things done. When people say they're over-the-hill at age 50, I don't understand it.","My message is, you can accomplish anything, not just on the athletic field, if you're willing to work pay the price. It doesn't matter what your age."],"Herta Muller":["If you live with death threats, you need friends. So you have to risk that they might spy on you.","It was only against my mother's will that I attended the preparatory high school in the city. She wanted me to become a seamstress in the village. She knew that if I moved to the city, I would become corrupted. And I was. I started to read books.","The more words we are allowed to take, the freer we become. If our mouth is banned, then we attempt to assert ourselves through gestures, even objects. They are more difficult to interpret, and take time before they arouse suspicion.","We didn't have any books at home. Not even children's books or fairy tales. The only 'fantastic' stories came from religion class. And I took them all very literally, that God sees everything, and so I felt I was always being watched. Or that dead people were in Heaven right over our village.","I learned Romanian very late, when I was fifteen, in town, and I wanted to learn it. I like the language very much.","Anything in literature, including memory, is second-hand.","In writing, one searches, and that is what keeps one writing, that one sees and experiences things from another angle entirely; one experiences oneself during the process of writing.","Writing itself does not know what it looks like while one is doing it, only when it's finished.","In Romanian society, I am not particularly well-liked. I don't often receive invitations.","If, in the very first pages, I'm forced to read gratuitous phrases or banal metaphors, I won't be able to get inside the story. Only if the sentences 'sparkle' can I get hooked.","I write in order to bear witness to life.","I speak a kind of Hapsburg language.","Romanian is a very beautiful, sensual, poetic language.","Through writing, one experiences something different to what one experiences with the five senses one has because language is a different metier.","If I don't belong because of what I think and because of my opinions, then so be it. What can one do about it? One can't bend over backwards or pretend to be someone else just to belong. And in any case, it doesn't work. Once you no longer belong, it's over.","Literature speaks with everyone individually - it is personal property that stays inside our heads. And nothing speaks to us as forcefully as a book, which expects nothing in return other than that we think and feel.","Ceausescu was mad, and he made half of Romania mad. I'm mad because of him.","As a child, I perceived my mother as an old woman.","One is either destroyed by adapting or for refusing to.","I believe that literature always goes precisely there where the damage to a person has been done.","What can't be said can be written. Because writing is a silent act, a labor from the head to the hand.","Suffering doesn't improve human beings, does it?","I have always written only for myself - to clarify things, to clarify things with myself, to understand in an inner way what is actually happening.","I never wanted to be a writer.","I find any kind of 'organizing' very difficult. And that has irksome consequences when it comes to books, since I've often wound up buying books twice because I couldn't find what I already have in all my mess.","My first book, 'Nadirs,' was very important for me. I'll leave its literary worth for others to judge. But its publication in Berlin in 1984 gave me protection. As did the awards it won. The Romanian secret police could no longer treat me and my friends as though we were completely cut off from the rest of the world. And we no longer felt cut off.","Whatever I read went under my skin. I almost devoured the literature, which became like a road to discovery.","Happiness may perhaps be shared. But not luck, sadly.","I am a broken person.","Working with language requires beauty for me.","For me, each journey to Romania is also a journey into another time, in which I never knew which events in my life were coincidence and which were staged. This is why I have, in every public statement I have made, demanded access to the secret files kept on me which, under various pretexts, have invariably been denied me.","My mother tongue is German.","You can't build a future if you don't have a past."],"Herve Villechaize":["I love you all too much, it's one of just of my problems.","I'm doing what I have to do.

But worthless who call not, heed not, but rest.","If you add a little to a little, and then do it again, soon that little shall be much.","Acquisition means life to miserable mortals.","Often an entire city has suffered because of an evil man.","We know how to speak many falsehoods that resemble real things, but we know, when we will, how to speak true things.","At the beginning of the cask and the end take thy fill but be saving in the middle; for at the bottom the savings comes too late.","If you should put even a little on a little and should do this often, soon this would become big.","Potter is jealous of potter, and craftsman of craftsman; and the poor have a grudge against the poor, and the poet against the poet.","It will not always be summer; build barns.","Justice prevails over transgression when she comes to the end of the race.","Whoever, fleeing marriage and the sorrows that women cause, does not wish to wed comes to a deadly old age.","False shame accompanies a man that is poor, shame that either harms a man greatly or profits him; shame is with poverty, but confidence with wealth.","How easily some light report is set about, but how difficult to bear.","Bring a wife home to your house when you are of the right age, not far short of 30 years, nor much above; this is the right time for marriage.","Preserve the mean; the opportune moment is best in all things.","Wealth should not be seized, but the god-given is much better.","Admire a small ship, but put your freight in a large one; for the larger the load, the greater will be the profit upon profit.","Giving is good, but taking is bad and brings death.","So the people will pay the penalty for their kings' presumption, who, by devising evil, turn justice from her path with tortuous speech.","Toil is no source of shame; idleness is shame.","But they who give straight judgements to strangers and to those of the land and do not transgress what is just, for them the city flourishes and its people prosper.","Do not gain basely; base gain is equal to ruin.","For both faith and want of faith have destroyed men alike."],"Hesketh Pearson":["Misquotation is, in fact, the pride and privilege of the learned. A widely- read man never quotes accurately, for the rather obvious reason that he has read too widely.","Misquotations are the only quotations that are never misquoted.","There is no stronger craving in the world than that of the rich for titles, except that of the titled for riches.","When people are old enough to know better they are old enough to do worse.","A man's character never changes radically from youth to old age.

But I don't care if someone calls me chef or Heston, it really doesn't bother me.","At home I've got 1,500 cook books and the spines have all gone, the pages are all torn - it's chaos.","I still love doing what I do, and I'm really lucky to get up in the morning and want to go to work.","I worked 120 hours a week for eight years. That's 20 to 22 hours a day every day and one week I only got 15 hours sleep."],"Heywood Broun":["Sports do not build character. They reveal it.","Brotherhood is not just a Bible word. Out of comradeship can come and will come the happy life for all.","People who come up through life or literature the hard way must inevitably carry their scars with them into composition.","A technical objection is the first refuge of a scoundrel.","Perhaps the most startling reversal of tradition came in the case of Lefty Grove. He shattered the cruel slanders which have always followed lefthanders.","Hell is paved with great granite blocks hewn from the hearts of those who said, I can do no other.","Even the revolutionary writer will err if he fails to grasp the enormous effectiveness of occasional understatement.","Nobody talks so constantly about God as those who insist that there is no God.","The most casual examination will reveal the fact that all the jokes about the horrible results of masculine cooking and sewing are written by men. It is all part of a great scheme of sex propaganda.","The tragedy of life is not that man loses but that he almost wins.","Everybody favours free speech in the slack moments when no axes are being ground.","The great threat to the young and pure in heart is not what they read but what they don't read.","I doubt whether the world holds for any one a more soul-stirring surprise than the first adventure with ice-cream.","The ability to make love frivolously is the chief characteristic which distinguishes human beings from beasts.","'Get up and hit a home run,' has never been a part of the usable technique of any manager.","I do know that whenever a player hits the ball out of the park, I have a sense of elation. I feel as if I had done it.","Increasingly, it becomes evident that managing a ball club is a psychiatrist's job. In a short series, the mental attitude of the combatants is everything.","The editorial strategy of the 'World' is seemingly rested upon the theory that in a desperate cause, it is well to ask a little less than you hope to get. I think you should ask more.","It is ridiculous to say that Sacco and Vanzetti are being railroaded to the chair. The situation is much worse than that. This is a thing done cold-bloodedly and with deliberation. But care and deliberation do not guarantee justice.","Life is not a matter of theories. Life is a matter of facts. It calls on the young and the old alike to face these facts, even though they are hard and sometimes unpleasant.","All spiritual things must have in them a childlike quality. The belief in immortality rests not very much on the hope of going on. Few of us want to do that, but we would like very much to begin again.","We are under no delusions as to the innate goodness even of very small children. They are bad a great deal of the time, but before it has been knocked out of them, they see no limit to the potentialities of the human will. Theirs is the faith to move mountains, because they do not yet know the fearful heft of them.","Every now and then, we hear parents commenting on the fearful things which motion pictures may do to the minds of children. They seem to think that a little child is full of sweetness and of light. We had the same notion until we had a chance to listen intently to the prattle of a three-year-old.","I do not see a necessary connection between proletarian literature and some set percentage of words which bring the blushes to a maiden's cheek.","I have always held to the theory that too much chalk may be just as bad for a novel as for a knee joint."],"Hiam Abbass":["My identity was a big issue when I was a teenager, and I had a lot of questions, like: 'Who am I?' 'Who do I belong to?' But when I was still quite young, I decided that belonging is a tough process in life, and I'd better say I belonged to myself and the world rather than belonging to one nationality or another.","Laughter is a way of really letting out all this pressure that you could face in your daily life in the suffering of your people, and comedy is almost like a medicine to your soul in a way.","I very much want to do things my way, and I want to control the result.","Simple things don't interest me.","I love to take risks and see how I cope with the situation.","My tendency in life is to like movies that deal with heavy stuff, but it's my nature.","I know myself - I cannot just play a cliche. It has to be a character; it has to be written with the complexity of the human being behind. Could be bad, could be good, could be someone we would hate, but still, I need a reason for that influence, and I need to understand why.","I grew up acutely aware of the exile and distance caused by war."],"Hiawatha":["Instead of a man of peace and love, I have become a man of violence and revenge.","Every human longs for peace and love.","It was not the path I was to take. Because of my deeds, I will never know peace again.","All the other chiefs and tribes have accepted the Great Law of Peace. They now live in peace with one another.","Peace will be when you accept it in your heart."],"Hideki Tojo":["It goes without saying that when survival is threatened, struggles erupt between peoples, and unfortunate wars between nations result.","When reflecting upon it today, that the Pearl Harbor attack should have succeeded in achieving surprise seems a blessing from Heaven. It was clear that a great American fleet had been concentrated in Pearl Harbor, and we supposed that the state of alert would be very high.","I am determined to offer an apology with my death.","I would point out that Japan's proposal at the Versailles Peace Conference on the principle of racial equality was rejected by delegates such as those from Britain and the United States.","Justice has nothing to do with victor nations and vanquished nations, but must be a moral standard that all the world's peoples can agree to. To seek this and to achieve it - that is true civilization.","On October 18, 1941, I suddenly received a mandate from His Majesty to form a new cabinet. This was completely unexpected, and when I was summoned to the Imperial Palace I thought I would be questioned on the army's point of view.","The reason was the failure of both Japan and China to understand each other and the inability of America and the European powers to sympathize, without prejudice, with the peoples of East Asia.","At the Imperial Conference on December 1, it was decided to make war against England and the United States.","Therefore, if one were to consider that there was virtually no possibility of success through the US-Japan negotiations, the military and economic pressures would only force Japan into further crisis if time were allowed to pass in vain.","The main American naval forces were shifted to the Pacific region and an American admiral made a strong declaration to the effect that if war were to break out between Japan and the United States, the Japanese navy could be sunk in a matter of weeks.","With options thus foreclosed, in order to protect and defend the nation and clear the obstacles that stood in its path, a decisive appeal to arms was made.","The causes of the China Incident were the exclusion and insult of Japan throughout China, the exclusion of Japanese goods, the persecution of Japanese residents in China, and the illegal violation of Japanese rights.","To advocate a New Order was to seek freedom and respect for peoples without prejudice, and to seek a stable basis for the existence all peoples, equally, and free of threats.","We now have to see our country surrender to the enemy without demonstrating our power up to 120 percent. We are now on a course for a humiliating peace - or, rather, a humiliating surrender.","During this period, Japan's peaceful commercial relations were successively obstructed, primarily by the American rupture of commercial relations, and this was a grave threat to the survival of Japan.","In dealing with the China problem, the British and American side, which had particularly strong interests in China, should have based its judgments about the origins of the problem on direct observation of the actual circumstances at the time.","Throughout that period, Japan had made honest efforts to keep the destruction of war from spreading and, based on the belief that all nations of the world should find their places, had followed a policy designed to restore an expeditious peace between Japan and China.","The Japanese government has accepted the notion that Japan is the loser, and it appears to be going to accept unconditional surrender. Such a position frustrates the officers and soldiers of the imperial armed forces.","From the point of the view of the nation's power, it was obvious that while we were fighting the Sino-Japanese war, every effort was to be made to avoid adding to our enemies and opening additional fronts.","Nevertheless, China was unfortunately unable to understand Japan's real position, and it is greatly to be regretted that the Sino-Japanese War became one of long duration.","Despite Japan's desires and efforts, unfortunate differences in the ways that Japan, England, the United States, and China understood circumstances, together with misunderstandings of attitudes, made it impossible for the parties to agree.","However, even during the preparations for action, we laid our plans in such a manner that should there be progress through diplomatic negotiation, we would be well prepared to cancel operations at the latest moment that communication technology would have permitted.","Thus, it was to seek true civilization and true justice for all the peoples of the world, and to view this as the destruction of personal freedom and respect is to be assailed by the hatred and emotion of war, and to make hasty judgments.","Even military ministers have no more than a certain amount of control. It is customary that they have the right and the power to participate, from a political and military point of view, in the planning of actual operations.","I would point out that the cultural advance of these people has been suppressed in the past and continues to be suppressed in the present by policies designed to keep them in ignorance."],"Hideo Kojima":["Genetic engineering is a result of science advancement, so I don't think that in itself is bad. If used wisely, genetics can be beneficial, but they can be abused, too.","Games shouldn't only be fun. They should teach or spark an interest in other things.","I am tremendously excited to introduce a unique 'Metal Gear Solid' experience to a new audience of gamers as well as collaborate with my mentor in game design, Mr. Miyamoto, on 'Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes' for Nintendo GameCube.","There are so many games where you fight aliens or zombies, and they have very high-fidelity graphics, but they don't ask the question of why the events are happening.","One of my first dreams when I was a child was becoming a painter.","I always say, 'This will be my last 'Metal Gear.'","There are many museums dedicated to technology, artistic endeavors, music, and that sort of thing. From that perspective, I think games really do have a place as a kind of collaborative art or a synthesis of all these various aspects into a whole, and that, in itself, can be perceived as art.","As a creator, I always want to betray fans' expectations.","I always observe the people who pass by when I ride an escalator. I'll never see most of them again, so I imagine a lot of things about their lives... about the day ahead of them.","I have always had a fascination about what's inside a human being.","I want to show people how there are variations and different interpretations of good and evil.","Looking back, I am thankful that I didn't go into the film industry.","People nowadays don't know about the Cold War and the U.S.'s old rivalry with the U.S.S.R.","Japanese players do not like being thrown into an arena in which they are given very little instruction. You can head in any direction, 360 degrees. They say, 'What am I supposed to do? Give me hints. Provide me service instead of just throwing me into this arena.'","As far as how I create games, I'm just reflecting what I feel, the things I have in my mind. I put those out there. Some of the things that I'm going through, the things that surround me, might be reflected there. But for me, it's a natural process. I just reflect what I feel into the game.","In any game, you have an enemy coming at yourself that you have to shoot. If you go back to 'Space Invaders,' they shoot at you when they come at you, so how are you going to protect yourself? You're going to shoot, and that is a typical videogame.","I have to have a creative role; otherwise, I simply wouldn't come into work.","It's part of my ritual to watch a new film every day, no matter what. It's important to me.","I try to watch a movie a day, if not more, and through movies, I learned about so many different political themes I hadn't been interested in and cultural things I hadn't been aware of and economic factors I hadn't thought about.","'Metal Gear Solid' is, for the most part, an infiltration game. You go somewhere, you execute your mission, then you go back. Those are your actions as the player.","My games are rather stressful games, where you have to play for a long time.","I don't really want to be a celebrity.","I believe that this cooperation between Nokia and Konami will form the perfect match to share the vast potential of mobile entertainment content with users all around the world.","My goal is to make a player think, 'I want to reenter this world of lies tomorrow.'","Personally, I'm not too fond of remakes.","What I'm really trying to do is create unique characters.","Even when people abroad see me, I'm often asked about a 'Zone of the Enders' sequel.","My biggest failure is 'Metal Gear.' It's my biggest failure and my biggest success.","I don't like necessarily that people think 'Metal Gear' defines me. I love 'Metal Gear,' don't get me wrong. But as a creator, I really want to work on other projects, including new games.","Every time I make a new game, I put all of my effort completely into that game. It's like putting all your effort into a new child that's being born. Once the project is done, I can step back and look at it objectively, which is when I can see a lot of flaws. That's when I start to make a new game that tries to fix some of those flaws.","In the past, the U.S. was the centre of the world, where everything was happening. I think my stories have always sought to question this, maybe even criticise it.","Hollywood continues to present the U.S. Army as being the good guys, always defeating the aliens or foreigners.","With a movie, it's probably easier to sustain intensity and seriousness over the 90-minute duration. But in an open-world game it becomes exhausting, demotivating and even uninteresting for the player.","Stories in which the player doesn't inhabit the main character are difficult for games to handle.","As a game creator, I'm not 100% satisfied when looking back at the previous game that I released.","There are so many books and movies I like; I never mention specific ones.","Normally, when people compose for film, you give them the film, and they look at it, and they compose it.","When I was small, I was always thinking about different worlds in my head.","In Japan, there are storm channels on either side of the main roads. There were so many times when I'd fall into these ditches because I was lost in stories as I was walking along. It's still dangerous for me to drive. I've driven into the gate outside my house numerous times.","My parents were huge fans of westerns, European cinema, and horror in particular. They wouldn't just show me kids' films.","To be honest, my friends weren't really as into making films as I was. But I convinced them all to make some zombie films with me.","If it weren't for Miyamoto-san, I wouldn't be where I am.","At Disneyland, you never go 'backstage' - even when you're in the bathroom.","I won't make games with senseless violence. There has to be a reason for it, such as war.","You have to be very careful when you're working on a sequel, because it has to be a continuation of what you did before.","Many people are taking 2D games and making them into 3D games by recreating the characters in polygons. But the gameplay's still the same, and that's not what they should be doing.","My first concept was for a game in which you were a prisoner of war and simply had to escape. If you were caught, you'd be brought back to the prison. The idea was for a non-combat game.","If 'Castlevania' wasn't created next to me, and Capcom didn't release 'Ghouls n' Goblins,' then maybe there wouldn't be any 'Metal Gear,' and I would have created a horror action game, because I really like that genre.","The last remaining thing that must be communicated to the next generation is an aging figure that still continues to change.","I want to continue making things.","I believe that even today we can only tell a simple story without really interfering with gameplay. But in the future, I think it will almost be a requirement of all storytellers when they create games, how they can tell a more complex story without conflicting with the gameplay.","I believe the game should really feel what the players are feeling and change according to that.","The painter has total control over what they're showing to the viewer.","When I was a child, there really weren't very many video games, but I do have memories of 'Pong.' Maybe it was 'Pong.' It was a home system in Japan, so maybe it wasn't the real 'Pong.' It was just sort of a Japanese game that was similar to 'Pong.'","My parents were born in the 1930s, and they experienced the air raids on Tokyo."],"Hidetoshi Nakata":["The biggest lesson I've learned by living abroad for the last four years is the importance of communication.","I will never again stand on the pitch as a professional player. But I won't stop playing the game.","As a professional athlete, I believe that I need to explore my opportunities to the maximum, in order to excel and continue to play the best football I can.","I notice that teams are now more interested in Japanese players than when I first went to Europe.","I think that the World Cup is a big factor for this increased interest. I don't believe all of this is a result of just myself but also because of the others who are playing abroad.","Living in Europe, I was surprised to find out just how little everyone knows about Japan.","We had only snacks last time, I think it was OK for a day time menu. But this time it will be late night when people gather so we should add some proper meals."],"Hilaire Belloc":["Loss and possession, death and life are one, There falls no shadow where there shines no sun.","I have wandered all my life, and I have also traveled; the difference between the two being this, that we wander for distraction, but we travel for fulfillment.","When friendship disappears then there is a space left open to that awful loneliness of the outside world which is like the cold space between the planets. It is an air in which men perish utterly.","Statistics are the triumph of the quantitative method, and the quantitative method is the victory of sterility and death.","I am writing a book about the Crusades so dull that I can scarcely write it.","I'm tired of love; I'm still more tired of rhyme; but money gives me pleasure all the time.","The grace of God is courtesy.","Oh, my friends, be warned by me, That breakfast, dinner, lunch and tea, Are all human frame requires.","An institute run with such knavish imbecility that if it were not the work of God it would not last a fortnight.","Every major question in history is a religious question. It has more effect in molding life than nationalism or a common language.","All men have an instinct for conflict: at least, all healthy men.","When I am dead, I hope it may be said: His sins were scarlet, but his books were read.","There is not anything that can so suddenly flood the mind with shame as the conviction of ignorance, yet we are all ignorant of nearly everything there is to be known.","The moment a man talks to his fellows he begins to lie.","Any subject can be made interesting, and therefore any subject can be made boring.","The pilgrim is humble and devout, and human, and charitable, and ready to smile and admire; therefore, he should comprehend the whole of his way, the people in it, and the hills and the clouds, and the habits of the various cities.","It is sometimes necessary to lie damnably in the interests of the nation.","Child! Do not throw this book about; refrain from the unholy pleasure of cutting all the pictures out.","From quiet homes and first beginning, out to the undiscovered ends, there's nothing worth the wear of winning, but laughter and the love of friends.","Just as there is nothing between the admirable omelet and the intolerable, so with autobiography.","Be content to remember that those who can make omelettes properly can do nothing else.","The microbe is so very small: You cannot take him out at all.","It is the best of all trades, to make songs, and the second best to sing them.","Of all fatiguing, futile, empty trades, the worst, I suppose, is writing about writing.","Is there no Latin word for Tea? Upon my soul, if I had known that I would have let the vulgar stuff alone.","Money gives me pleasure all the time."],"Hilarie Burton":["There's something about a holiday that isn't all about how much money you spend.","Fourth of July. My birthday is July first, and my best friend's birthday is July fifth, so it's always been a favorite holiday. It's all about having a cooler full of sodas, hot dogs, and just hanging out and shooting off firecrackers, being low-key, watching the fireworks.","For me, I always wonder what's worse: an emotional betrayal or a physical betrayal? That's a really tough call.","I move around a lot. I've lived in a ton of different places - and only for a month or two at a time. I have a deep, rabid curiosity, so I like having a gypsy life.","My weekends are spent hidden in the woods, and then I have to come back and pretend to be this very upper-crust insurance investigator. But, I mean, duality's nice. You never get bored. You can't say the grass is always greener if you're in both backyards.","I don't engage in social media, which has its good and bad sides, I guess - but the good side is when people hate my guts, I'm kind of oblivious to it.","I grew up in such a macho family. I had a former Green Beret for a dad, a mom who's really rough-and-tumble, and three very macho brothers.","When you're younger, it's hard because you're finding your identity, and then for 12 hours out of the day, you have to be a different person. So that's a tricky phase - as far as figuring who you are out and then figuring out the people that you're working with.","I used to have to think about awful things to get myself emotionally connected to something.","I play damaged people a lot. I'm a Cancer. And I say that tongue and cheek, but I wear my heart on my sleeve. I'm a very emotional woman.","I grew up in the United Methodist Church, and church was always a very big part of my growing up.","I've always been very vocal about my religion. It's a big part of who I am.","I want the kids who watch 'One Tree Hill' to know that it's all pretend, and that the person at the core of that character values morals, honor and things like that. You want to inspire them to look beyond what is superficial and try to find that greater thing.","I'm from northern Virginia, but I grew up next to the West Virginia border, so it was hills and farmland. We had that sense of adventure you get from growing up around old farmhouses and lazy, rolling hills, you know?","'One Tree Hill' was my very first television audition; it was a fairytale. I feel really lucky to have that level of success right out of the gate.","Everybody wants a sensational story.","I will never say a bad word about 'One Tree Hill'. The entire shape of my world changed because of that show, so I'll always be very affectionate toward it.","'One Tree Hill' was a great learning opportunity for me, and I'm excited to go and apply that elsewhere and see where I end up.","I grew up at the base of a mountain in Virginia, so my comfort zone is that Appalachian area, where all the dudes wear Carhartt and all the women can put on a beautiful sweater with a snowman applique and nobody raises an eyebrow.","I think the first couple of times you do make-out scenes, you psych yourself out and it's really nerve racking.","I like the guy who reads. Being articulate is something that's very important to me. But you need to know how to chop wood and fix a car and do guy things. I didn't grow up with spectators. Nobody was a spectator.","In the world of Facebook and Twitter, you can treasure hunt for tidbits about somebody that you find interesting and pretty much find out everything you need to know - which is why I stay away from social media - I'm terrified of it.","Isn't Googling someone the first thing everyone does?! They meet someone new and Google them!","I've named a couple things after Edgar Allan Poe: the cat, and my garden upstate, where I only planted black flowers and purple flowers - and there's a raven statue.","I like to write paper mail - nobody does that anymore - with my pen pals.","Gardening gloves are for sissies. I always have dirt under my nails.","I like my hands. They're certainly scarred up, but they're wormy. They're knuckly. They're hands that have done stuff, and they're not going anywhere.","Subletting is great. You get to try on all these different versions of yourself. This apartment was clearly decorated by an artist - there's a great, big, huge chandelier and red fur rug, and it's all stuff that I would never, ever, ever buy."],"Hilary Duff":["The love you have for your child is so much greater than any challenge you'll face as a parent, and that's what helps you through.","I have always been interested in the paranormal and afterlife, everything from ghosts to angels. I think that everyone has that curiosity of the great unknown.","I think people assume I'm perfect. I'm not. I make mistakes. I do things I regret. I'm stubborn.","It's hard to stay true to yourself and what you want in life when there are so many distractions and so much craziness going on around you.","A part of me isn't like those women who love being pregnant. I love my baby, and I miss that feeling of being attached to him when he's kicking, but I was so ready to not be pregnant.","I'm pretty good at thinking about everything - all of my consequences - before I make a decision, and I think about everything that's going to happen because of that decision. I'm a Libra, and I'm very strategic.","My life is very crazy and busy, but I love it that way.","Mom always tells me to celebrate everyone's uniqueness. I like the way that sounds.","People are going to say what they want to say and think what they want to think, and I can't change their minds.","I stopped going to school in the middle of fourth grade. Everyone grows up with the peer pressure, and kids being mean to each other in school. I think that's such a horrible thing, but I never really dealt with it in a high school way.","Every week I read about myself in a magazine, about something that I haven't done or some place that I've never been or don't even know. It's just gossip, rumors, egos, and politics.","People talk worse about people than they talk good about people, because a lot of people like drama.","When I'm on tour, I'm in a new city every single night, and the energy and the crowds and the kids and the screaming and them knowing every single word of my music and being onstage is such an energetic feeling with a big payoff.","My mom always says, 'If you don't believe in something, you'll lose yourself completely.'","I love doing emotional scenes. As I've had a perfect life, I don't really have much to pull from. But it's really fun and not that challenging. It's almost pretty easy. The hardest thing is to try and make people laugh. That's a really hard thing.","Girls bat their eyelashes and act like they don't know anything in front of guys they like, or give a little bit of eye contact, but not too much, or a bit of touching. Or being coy. Sure, I do a bit of that.","I don't keep a journal anymore. I did when I was younger, and I think its good for young girls to try and express what they are feeling on paper; it's cathartic.","I've had a very unique path that's different from everybody else's. I was never a dater. I never went out that much. I've always had long-distance relationships. And, everything has come very fast in my life. I haven't waited for much.","No, I'm not! I'm not a tomboy! I love my makeup! That's not true! I'm not a tomboy!","I ate a bug once. It was flying around me. I was trying to get it away. It went right in my mouth. It was so gross!","Weird, but sometimes I feel more like my cartoon character than I do Lizzie because she's a little more edgy and snappy.","I started taking singing classes just two years ago. It was great. I never knew I could sing but I kind of found my voice.","Like going to my favorite restaurant, it can sometimes get hard. I just can't go to the mall.","I knew I wanted to act, and I was really driven, so I kept going for it. We moved to L.A. full-time when I was 8 or 9.","I also love Dido and Nelly Furtado and people who are really into their music like that. And I love Renee Zellweger.","Now my music is kind of pop-rock, right? If I'm 25 and singing still, I don't want to be singing music like that.","I pop gum. My parents get so annoyed with me. I know my dad wishes he never taught me how to do that.","Sometimes I just wish I had a day off. I really need to clean my room.","At first, when I got bad press and people would talk bad about my family or something like that, I would get really upset, but now it's just not worth my energy.","I love clothes. I can't control myself. I have a huge fetish for shoes and clothes and make-up. I'm the kind of person who doesn't like to wear things over and over again.","I know I can handle dramatic roles, but I don't think I should have to play a young mother on crack to prove it.","I'm drawing the gossip surrounding the celebrity, or the image the celebrity tries to push on us.","I have an older sister named Haley and she wanted to be an actress. So I wanted to be an actress. It's really funny the way that some people don't give kids enough credit for like really being driven, and really wanting to do things so badly.","I love my mom. I totally look up to her, and she just doesn't let anybody take advantage of me. People might call that a stage mom.","So many schools are getting rid of music programs and it's really sad because I know that when I started singing and stuff it was something that I always wanted to do and I never believed in myself to be able to do it.","I think I'm happy with who I am. I don't know if I learned that from other girls or just people in general.","My relationship with my mom is so amazing. We never got to have that stage that people go through, like when you're 13 and you think you're too cool for your parents. When you're embarrassed by them and stuff. We never went through that because I was constantly working and she constantly had to be there.","I love men who have a lot going on in their lives, like I do.","There definitely was a time when I was pretty obsessed with my weight, but I'm better off not stressing about my body all the time.","It's not attractive when girls get superskinny. Guys don't like it. Girls don't like you as much. You lose some happiness when that's all you think about.","When I first got my record deal, I was like, 'I just want to sing,' and I never put much thought into what really goes into a record. But as I got older, I developed a passion for writing.","Before I wasn't sure what I wanted to say, but now, I have had so many different experiences that they have given me what I want to get across in my music.","My mom taught me not to talk about money.","When I turned about 18 or 19, I was really ready to, like, stop being - stop being seen in this, like, perfect light.","I think ambition can be having something that you're good at and love to do.","I think every actor is looking for a challenge, and to play something different, and to be a part of a project with other great actors.","I love that Euro-pop dance music, but with girl power. I also listen to Janis Joplin and Bob Dylan. I have a Beatles song tattooed on my foot. I'm all over the place.","I just think that there's so much judgment in the world, whether it's coming from women in general or from men onto women - it's a lot. And when it comes to being a mom, I wish everyone could band together and realize that everyone has different beliefs, different styles, and different things that work for them and their family.","As a mom, it's so important to feel confident in what you're doing.","You don't need to push your beliefs onto other people!","Everybody always talks about it, about how you don't know love until you meet your baby, and you really feel that. There are no words. It was a really wonderful surprise. And there is no way to prepare yourself for the sleep deprivation and what comes with it.","My first crush was on John Travolta in 'Grease.'","Guys make me feel secure and comfortable when I'm scared or need attention. They bring stability. And affection. And fun. And drama. You learn so much from a boyfriend. It's hard to put into words, I guess.","I don't believe in having one partner for your whole life, but I hope I get married. I want to have a husband and two kids and a nice little life baking pies. I'm quite romantic. It's definitely important to have someone make you feel special.","Humans are very complex; I definitely have a new respect for authors that are able to write books nonstop. It's an incredible talent.","I have been writing songs and poems since I was a little girl. I started writing short scripts, which evolved into the idea for a book.","Sometimes I got scared of being too honest, because being in the public eye, I have always tried to hide my personal life. But I realized that isn't healthy.","I'm outgoing when I have to be, but usually, I'm kinda shy. I always think people don't want to talk to me. Some people might take that as being stuck-up, but I'm just shy.","I try not to look at my schedule for the week because I'll get so overwhelmed. Every day, there are multiple things to be done and 10 things I don't end up accomplishing.","I love Natalie Portman. She worked when she was younger, and she's so talented and private. She doesn't do things that are too crazy, but she pushes the envelope enough."],"Hilary Knight":["I'm a 'blue sky thinker' and dream big.","The most valuable advice I can give is plan for your success. Write down your ideal goal, creating checkpoints for yourself along the way that align with the end goal. Set up rewards for achieving both little victories and big ones.","Girls are breaking barriers and boundaries every day in everything from sports and science to business and the creative arts.","Going into a locker room that's not even yours to begin with is certainly like you're entering the lion's den.","People don't know how fantastic women's ice hockey is. People don't know how fantastic hockey is in general.","Women in general, we tend to shrink ourselves and not have as much confidence as we should in presenting ourselves and our body types. It's OK to be fit and healthy and comfortable within your body, whatever frame you have.","It's a great culture to be a part of: there are hockey players all over the world. It has taken me to an education, getting an education at Wisconsin. I've been able to travel the world.","Now I can give back and be a role model and an advocate for women in sport.","Whenever you go into a game, you want to win, and you want to come out victorious in any way.","I think my role on a team is I love to put the puck in the back of the net. If that opportunity presents itself, and it happens for me, I get really excited.","Whenever you get Brianna Decker on the ice, and Emily Field and Amanda Pelkey, people are just going to go fast and push the pace.","I think having a strong female figure in my mom as an in-house role model was huge and really motivated me to continue to pursue my passion and my dreams.","Obviously, different people identify me as the face of women's hockey and whatnot, but like my teammates, I'm just there to perform and compete.","The cool thing about a start-up - this is sort of the entrepreneur side of me - is that you can make it grow as much as you can. Or you can squander the talent as much as you want. But it's up to you.","I love my fans.","I remember coming out of college thinking, 'OK, I'm gonna get an agent, and I'm gonna make money. I'm gonna make millions of dollars.' And that never happened.","It was tough to get to where I am, to get the following that I do have on social media and all the fans out there, which I greatly appreciate, but I would love to have a template so the next girl who grows up doesn't have to go through a lot of the hardships that we faced in our generation.","I absolutely have loved my career path and everything that I've done personally, but it was tough.","I golf for my own entertainment and my teammates' entertainment.","I am extremely grateful to have had the opportunity to play hockey, especially when there weren't equal opportunities as there are now. But at times, it was challenging.","The Olympics are a completely different beast. It's the most magical moment of your career.","I would like to go back to school, potentially.","Whatever I do, I want to impact people's lives in a positive way.","Growing up on an all-boys' team wasn't the easiest thing. I'd have guys come after me on the ice and just hit me because I'm a girl. I'd have parents heckling me from the stands, other parents not wanting me on the team, not making certain teams just because I was a girl.","I'm trying to change up the pace in which I approach life so I'm not always go, go, go.","My dad was traveling a lot, but when he would come home and cook, he'd cook pizza.","When I was 5, I'm like,' I'm doing this,' whether there's women's ice hockey, men's ice hockey, whatever it was in my future.","Everything I do is for a gold medal for this country.","I saw the older kids entering the rink carrying hockey sticks and bags, and I was fascinated by the equipment. Once I started skating faster, I was attracted to the speed and dynamics of hockey. I never looked back!","I am the oldest in our family. I have three younger brothers. I needed to set a great example for them. It instilled a sense of competition in me and hunger to strive to be the best. There's a lot of pride being the only girl and the oldest.","When our world is telling girls and women who they should be or what they should look like, it is critical that we empower those girls and young women to be confident with who they are.","When I was 5 years old, I told my grandmother I was going to play hockey in the Olympics. Fifteen years later, I competed in my first Olympics.","The real answers aren't in textbooks; they can be found through experiences.","My two earliest memories - earning little buttons on our skates when we learned how to skate from one end of the ice to the other and when I first lifted the puck.","Both of my parents have loved and supported me from my very first strides.","I love going to the movies, whitewater rafting in the summer when I am home in Idaho, biking in the summer in Idaho, paddle boarding in the summer.","I try to get a well-balanced diet with a mix of greens, protein, and carbs.","I absolutely love music. Music is so powerful and can set the tone and change your mood.","The song 'I Feel the Earth Move' brings me back to those younger years when I was taking my first strides on the ice.","The songs that are on my playlist find themselves there because I can identify with the lyrics, or they have some magical transformative power in the beat.","I think, as an athlete, you tend to be cautious of your body language and what you're doing on the ice. That might be the only moment someone sees you.","As long as I still love the game and I can contribute to a team, I'd love to keep playing.","I went to a lot of Chicago Wolves games when I was growing up... They would come out of the tunnel, the pyramid would be there, and the fire would come out of the pyramid. I thought it was the coolest thing.","When I graduated from the University of Wisconsin, I was highly encouraged to move to Boston to train as a hopeful for the 2014 Sochi Olympic Games. I remember packing up my car, traveling out here to live with other teammates and share an apartment.","I believe in lifestyle changes to accommodate a healthy living.","I know there are sort of misnomers that women's hockey isn't as physical or fast as the guys, but women's hockey is very dynamic and tactful in its own ways. It's just as respectable of a sport as any male counterpart.","How do we make hockey more affordable? How do we get it into more households? How do we keep it part of the conversation? Those are things that will help us not only increase registration numbers from a grassroots level but also deepen the player pool from the senior national team and the elite level.","Whenever you step on the ice, you need to be a student of the game and try to hone your craft. You're never going to play a perfect match, but you're always chasing that perfect game.","I think you are a product of the environment you surround yourself in, and everything you've experienced is a part of you and the fabric you are in.","It was somewhere in Ohio - Cedar Point or something like that - one of those thrill rides. A few cars up, someone's sunglasses had fallen off, and we were on one of those corkscrew parts, and I saw sunglasses and just instinctively grabbed them right out of the air. I was like, 'Oh, my reaction time is really good. This is going well.'","Being surrounded by great women and amazing role models and good teammates allowed me to unfold and evolve into the person that I am today.","I wear yoga pants and get to work out all the time - it's my job. I feel a little bit different when I go into what I call 'the real world.' It's cool to be able to train as a full-time job, and it's something that I love and will continue to try to make work for the next however-many years.","I'm able to be able to achieve certain things that others aren't - whether it's a reaction time or the idea of a coffee that's about to be spilled and I'm able to grab it before anyone else or whatever it is.","Fortunately, I have some amazing partners that I work with that continue to support me and enable me to unleash the best me!","My favorite country that I have visited would have to be Sweden. I'm such a sucker for the Swedish culture, and I learned Swedish in college, so I like to try and navigate my way around.","Scoring two goals to win a game will hurt an opponent more than a punch in the face.","I like going on adventures or excursions.","I hope one day I will be able to play in a game in the NHL, not just practice.","Here I am just trying to fund myself to play a sport, but the greater picture is that I'm a female athlete really pushing the envelope for women in sports.","At first, I felt like I was put into this box because I played hockey. I thought that I was viewed a certain way, and I shouldn't wear certain clothes. Finally, I stepped aside and said, 'That's someone else's creation of me. I can be feminine and be strong.'","Social media is huge. You can give people a behind-the-scenes look at your life.","I don't think any game means less than the other ones. You always want to win.","My mantra is, 'Dare to be...' I leave it open-ended, because depending on the mood, the weather, the day, you might need a different power word. Having a power word can help steer you in the right direction, especially when things aren't going your way.","Just having the hunger to continue to learn motivates me.","For lunch, I usually have a burrito or burrito-style bowl with rice, beans, a little cheese, avocado, and tomato.","Each person on a team has a responsibility and a role, and knowing the value of each individual and what they bring to the table is something very special and unique.","I've always been sensitive to the phrase 'like a girl,' especially when I was growing up and was told I couldn't play with the boys. It really resonated with me. I was so inspired by the first #LikeAGirl video, and I wanted to be a part of such a powerful message.","'Playing like a girl' was used as a demeaning term instead of an empowering one. I am proud to be a girl and rocking the ice.","Growing up, and the way that the media portrays, you're supposed to look a certain way. Muscles aren't beautiful. Muscles aren't feminine.","Strong is beautiful. I want to shatter that stereotype that strong isn't beautiful, because it absolutely is.","In my first two world championship experiences, I barely saw the ice at all.","I have to eat a lot more in the summer because I'm burning more calories.","Cheat meals? I love cheat meals.","I love cheeseburgers; I love fries, cheese curds, the list goes on.","I think the biggest thing is people forget that we're these crazy athletes with these athlete bodies and stuff, but it's just important to feed the other side of it, and if there's a piece of cake there, have the piece of cake. You earned it. You only live once.","Equality should be a thing we don't even have to talk about anymore.","You have to lose to win a silver medal, so that's always the tough thing to wrap your head around."],"Hilary Mantel":["Novelists, it seems to me, are the very last people who should be asked to comment on the news of the day, and sooner or later, when they have been pilloried for their views, most of them recognise this.","Insights don't usually arrive at my desk, but go into notebooks when I'm on the move. Or half-asleep.","I'm one of these children who grew up at the knee of my grandmother and her elder sister, listening to very old people talk about their memories.","History offers us vicarious experience. It allows the youngest student to possess the ground equally with his elders; without a knowledge of history to give him a context for present events, he is at the mercy of every social misdiagnosis handed to him.","Once you're labeled as mentally ill, and that's in your medical notes, then anything you say can be discounted as an artefact of your mental illness.","When I wrote about the French Revolution, I didn't choose to write about aristocrats; I chose characters who began their lives in provincial obscurity.","For myself, the only way I know how to make a book is to construct it like a collage: a bit of dialogue here, a scrap of narrative, an isolated description of a common object, an elaborate running metaphor which threads between the sequences and holds different narrative lines together.","When you have committed enough words to paper, you feel you have a spine stiff enough to stand up in the wind. But when you stop writing, you find that's all you are - a spine, a row of rattling vertebrae, dried out like an old quill pen.","Imagination only comes when you privilege the subconscious, when you make delay and procrastination work for you.","Sometimes I fantasize that all my furniture has been destroyed in a cataclysm, and I have to start again with only the stationery catalogue. My entire house would become an office, which would be an overt recognition of the existing state of affairs.","History is always changing behind us, and the past changes a little every time we retell it.","I am very happy in second-hand bookshops; would a gardener not be happy in a garden?","I think it took me half a page of 'Wolf Hall' to think: 'This is the novel I should have been writing all along.'","When you write, you are not either sex. But when you're read you are definitely gendered.","As a writer, you owe it to yourself not to get stuck in a rut of looking at the world in a certain way.","It follows that if you are not a mother you are not a grandmother. Your life has become unpunctuated, whereas the lives of other women around you have these distinct phases.","I spend a great deal of time on research, on finding all the available accounts of a scene or incident, finding out all the background details and the biographies of the people involved there, and I try to run up all the accounts side by side to see where the contradictions are, and to look where things have gone missing.","Since I was a very small child, I've had a kind of reverence for the past, and I felt a very intimate connection with it.","My first two novels were very black comedies.","I've got so many ideas, and sometimes the more exhausted my body gets, the more active my mind gets.","Much historical fiction that centers on real people has always been deficient in information, lacking in craft and empty in affect.","Like a historian, I interpret, select, discard, shape, simplify. Unlike a historian, I make up people's thoughts.","Hindsight is the historian's necessary vice.","Memory isn't a theme; it's part of the human condition.","My thoughts have been the thing I can rely on.","I think if I hadn't become a writer I would just have suppressed that part of my personality. I think I would have put it in a box that I never opened.","Sometimes people ask, 'Does writing make you happy?' But I think that's beside the point. It makes you agitated, and continually in a state where you're off balance. You seldom feel serene or settled.","I'm a very organised and rational and linear thinker, and you have to stop all that to write a novel.","What fascinates me are the turning points where history could have been different.","When I was a child, there was very little money, so I've always been concerned for my financial security, which has meant that finding myself as a writer was a bad move. The practical difference the money has made is that I can support myself by fiction. That is what I have been trying to do throughout my life.","Back in my 20s, when I wrote 'A Place of Greater Safety,' the French Revolution novel, I thought, 'I'll always have to write historical novels because I can't do plots.' But in the six years of writing that novel, I actually learned to write, to invent things.","The novelist has a responsibility to adhere to the facts as closely as possible, and if they are inconvenient, that's where the art comes in. You must work with intractable facts and find the dramatic shape inside them.","I dislike pastiche; it attracts attention to the language only.","It is difficult to know how the Tudors actually spoke because we're going back before Shakespeare; much of the drama from that period is courtly, allegorical.","Psychics tap into what is collective: our regret and our sense of time going by; our common repression and anxieties.","My childhood gave me a very powerful sense of being spooked. I didn't know whether what I was seeing were sensory images of other people's unhappiness. Perhaps that was just the way the world manifested itself to me.","I spend a lot of my time talking to the dead, but since I get paid for it, no one thinks I'm mad.","Writing comes from that territory of being invalidated. But I had a sense of purpose, too. I wanted to stop apologising for my health, and I thought I might do some good.","When I was thin, I had no notion of what being fat is like. When I worked in a department store, I had sold clothes to women of most sizes, so I should have known; but perhaps you have to experience the state from the inside, to understand what fat is like.","When you get fat, you get a new personality. You can't help it. Complete strangers ascribe it to you.","If you skew the endocrine system, you lose the pathways to self. When endocrine patterns change, it alters the way you think and feel. One shift in the pattern tends to trip another.","'Wolf Hall' attempts to duplicate not the historian's chronology but the way memory works: in leaps, loops, flashes.","I am usually protective of my work, not showing it to anyone until it has been redrafted and polished.","'Show up at the desk' is one of the first rules of writing, but for 'Wolf Hall' I was about 30 years late.","When narratives fracture, when words fail, I take consolation from the part of my life that always works: the stationery order. The mail-order stationery people supply every need from royal blue Quink to a dazzling variety of portable hard drives.","Writers displace their anxiety on to the tools of the trade. It's better to say that you haven't got the right pencil than to say you can't write, or to blame your computer for losing your chapter than face up to your feeling that it's better lost.","Write a book you'd like to read. If you wouldn't read it, why would anybody else? Don't write for a perceived audience or market. It may well have vanished by the time your book's ready.","If you have a good story idea, don't assume it must form a prose narrative. It may work better as a play, a screenplay or a poem. Be flexible.","Concentrate your narrative energy on the point of change. This is especially important for historical fiction. When your character is new to a place, or things alter around them, that's the point to step back and fill in the details of their world.","If you get stuck, get away from your desk. Take a walk, take a bath, go to sleep, make a pie, draw, listen to music, meditate, exercise; whatever you do, don't just stick there scowling at the problem. But don't make telephone calls or go to a party; if you do, other people's words will pour in where your lost words should be.","Though I have never thought of myself as a book collector, there are shelves in our house browsed so often, on so many rainy winter nights, that the contents have seeped into me as if by osmosis.","Like every writer, I'm drawn by unlikely juxtapositions, precisely-dated and once-only collisions between people from different worlds.","The old always think the world is getting worse; it is for the young, equipped with historical facts, to point out that, compared with 1509, or even 1939, life in 2009 is sweet as honey.","What really disconcerts commentators, I suspect, is that when they read historical fiction, they feel their own lack of education may be exposed; they panic, because they don't know which bits are true.","I didn't cry much after I was 35, but staggered stony-faced into middle age, a handkerchief still in my bag just in case.","I once stole a book. It was really just the once, and at the time I called it borrowing. It was 1970, and the book, I could see by its lack of date stamps, had been lying unappreciated on the shelves of my convent school library since its publication in 1945.","My first career ambitions involved turning into a boy; I intended to be either a railway guard or a knight errant.","I think I would have been a reasonably good lawyer. I have a faculty for making sense of mountains of information.","I would have been a disaster as a career politician. I would never have toed a party line.","The more history I learnt, the less interested I got in winning arguments and the more interested in establishing the truth.","Sometimes you buy a book, powerfully drawn to it, but then it just sits on the shelf. Maybe you flick through it, the ghost of your original purpose at your elbow, but it's not so much rereading as re-dusting. Then one day you pick it up, take notice of the contents; your inner life realigns.","The experienced writer says to the anguished novice: 'Just do it; get something, anything, on to the screen or page, just establish a flow of words, and criticise them later.' You give this advice but can't always take it.","Fear of commitment lies behind the fear of writing.","You can control and censor a child's reading, but you can't control her interpretations; no one can guess how a message that to adults seems banal or ridiculous or outmoded will alter itself and evolve inside the darkness of a child's heart.","Like many people, I am addicted to the physical act of reading.","Fiction leaves us so much work to do, allows the individual so much input; you have to see, you have to hear, you have to taste the madeleine, and while you are seemingly passive in your chair, you have to travel.","But an experienced reader is also a self-aware and critical reader. I can't remember ever reading a story without judging it.","Novels teach you that actions have consequences. They help you grow up.","I once dreamed a whole short story. Wrapped in its peculiar atmosphere, as if draped in clouds, I walked entranced to my desk at about 4 A.M. and typed it on to the screen.","There are plenty of books that tell you how to become a writer, but not one that suggests how, if you want a normal life, you might reverse the process.","Writers do not want to think they are less rational than other people, and at the mercy of compulsions, but in their hearts they know they are like those people who are taken for walks by their dogs, towed through hedges and ditches by an untrained sub-human energy.","Life being so short, and the possible books to write so many, it's good to function by night as well as by day; but would anybody become a writer if they realised at the outset what the working hours were?","For many imaginative writers, working for the press is a fact of their life. But it's best not to like it too much.","Fiction isn't made by scraping the bones of topicality for the last shreds and sinews, to be processed into mechanically recovered prose. Like journalism, it deals in ideas as well as facts, but also in metaphors, symbols and myths.","A novel should be a book of questions, not a book of answers.","In my 20s I was in constant pain from undiagnosed endometriosis. With no prospect of a cure, I decided I needed a career - writing - that could accommodate being ill."],"Hilary Putnam":["No sane person should believe that something is subjective merely because it cannot be settled beyond controversy.","I think part of the appeal of mathematical logic is that the formulas look mysterious - You write backward Es!"],"Hilary Rhoda":["I appreciate anything thoughtful.","Since traveling is such a big part of my life when I am working, I like to vacation relatively close to home. Florida is a great place for me to go and relax. It's so close, which is perfect because it's the minimal travel time.","I always look forward to the holidays because I love dressing up in festive, shimmery evening dresses.","I feel the best after a workout - I'm sweaty and exhausted, but it also gives me an energy I really like.","I rarely use a stylist, and enjoy choosing my outfit on my own. If you know what suits your body and personality then your individual style emerges naturally.","Maxi dresses are also my best friend. They take me from my morning coffee, to the beach, to nighttime.","Wearing a breathable fabric is the most important thing for me. I also love to keep it simple and keep the number of garments I'm wearing ideally at one (a sundress for example), and then add some great jewelry.","I've never had a specific style philosophy. I wear what I know works on me and I'll play around with accessories or some other fun additions for the outfit.","When I have extra time I just go out to the Hamptons. I have a house in Southampton I go out to as much as I possibly can.","Peanut Butter M&Ms in the fridge, I always have a giant bag. Every cookie and candy I put in the fridge, it always manages to taste better when it's cold.","I imagine Heaven would have very nice weather - perfect climate where you can wear a leather jacket or shorts and a sweater.","I'm so addicted to 'Homeland' right now."],"Hilary Rosen":["Music has an intrinsic value that touches Americans - they love their music, and want more.","As a mom I know that raising children is the hardest job there is.","Everything we are doing is on the cutting edge of so many different industries and so many different interests. We're out there in the sunshine, and it feels fine.","There is no sense in owning the copyright unless you are going to use it. I don't think anyone wants to hold all of this stuff in a vault and not let anybody have it. It's only worth something once it's popular.","Working moms, stay at home moms, they're both extremely hard jobs.","Unauthorized use of these MP3 files is really creating a problem for artists in the music community.","When ATM machines came out and people were prosecuted for robbing ATM machines, I don't think anybody thought the banks were against technology because they didn't want their ATM machines lifted.","I don't have any illusions that what we are doing is sticking the the bottle. I don't think that's what we are doing. We are trying to make sure that the genie has friends, has food to eat, a way to grow.","Napster is essentially using the music to make money for themselves and that's the part that's both morally and legally wrong. That I think is more relevant than whether or not I'm losing money.","The enforcement is the flip side to the growth. And that's OK.","The innovation is going to come, and that is good for everybody.","There are some very real areas where working together is critical, whether it's talking about public policy issues, enforcement, or how to work together to facilitate new business opportunities. The RIAA has gotten much more involved in that.","This is a business built on promotion. We've been giving music away to radio stations for 30 years.","We are going after a targeted group of businesses that are creating opportunities for themselves using other people's property. The Internet has very little to do with this.","Our profile was pretty low, deliberately so. Our constituents were a relatively small audience.","As a partner in a firm full of women who work outside of the home as well as stay at home mothers, all with plenty of children, gender equality is not a talking point for me. It is an issue I live every day.","A protracted legislative fight will not move us closer to where the music industry wants to be - delivering music to fans through a variety of different, innovative Web sites.","A lot of artists are much more concerned about how their work is used and how it's disseminated. That, to artists, is as important as the money, for some people.","For music, unlike a $500 software program, people are paying a buck or two a song, and it's those dollars and pennies that have to add up to pay for not just the cost of that song, but the investment in the next song.","The Constitution wanted artists to have control over their works because they knew it would create incentive to create more works. That is clearly still the goal.","The marketplace can handle this. The laws are there. The courts have shown a consistent ability to find a balance between copyright owners and copyright users."],"Hilary Swank":["I had to fight my whole life to break out of my circumstances. That's just part of my makeup.","'Oh, the Places You'll Go!,' by Dr. Seuss, is still one of my favorite books ever.","To me, working out is literally like eating a meal or drinking water or breathing.","I don't think people should have boundaries put on them, by themselves or society or another gender, because it's our birthright to experience life in whatever way we feel best suits us.","I think about how I'm spending my money, and I like to spend on my family.","Learning how to fly, for me, was so euphoric.","I can remember crying on the set of Beverly Hills 90210 after being released from the show a few years ago.","I don't know what I did in this life to deserve all of this. I'm just a girl from a trailer park who had a dream.","I grew up in a trailer park in Bellingham, Washington.","I haven't tucked a sock in my pants for three years.","One thing I've learned: You never know where life is taking you, but it's taking you.","The truth is, after Boys Don't Cry, I realized how few and far between the great roles are. I am beyond thankful for finding Million Dollar Baby.","My relaxation has always been my animals - going to the dog park with them, going to the beach.","I really chase the things that I want.","Growing up in a lower-income family, you don't have the resources to make ends meet and you have to find creative ways to get by.","Few people know this about me, but I love baking pies.","I like to play women who blaze trails.","You only have one life and if you're not doing what you love, what's the point?","I love to travel. I'm a curious person.","It's a quality of my life that I wouldn't change for the world, having grown up with such a humble background.","I'm certainly not very book smart, but I started traveling at 16, and it has enriched me in ways I could never begin to explain.","I took 'P.S. I Love You' thinking it was going to be a little funny, and I ended up crying every day on that film.","There's so much more to life than looking a certain way.","I think that we're all continually searching for who we are, and that's ever-evolving and changing.","It's how you look at beauty. Is it only an outward appearance with hair and makeup and a hot body, or is it something deeper than that?","One of the great things about my job is I get to do all of these things that I may not experience had I not been an actor.","My job is about playing people. And I think once you lose touch with people, what do you play?","I had teachers who I could tell didn't want to be there. And I just couldn't get inspired by someone who didn't want to be there."],"Hilda Solis":["My parents raised me and my six siblings with little money... but lots of love.","Young people need the hands-on training that comes with a summer job. They need to know how to dress for success and nail job interviews. But most of all, they need mentorship, guidance, and inspiration.","People have to be reminded that unions played a very historic role in our economy.","I would hope more people would have optimism about where the Latino has come. How we have emerged, and that there will be more women, women of color especially Latinas who will get involved.","No family should have to depend on the labor of its children to put food on the table and no person should be forced to work in captivity.","I saw the prospect of serving as labor secretary as a wonderful opportunity to further the policies that I have been fighting for my whole life, and I had to seize it.","Well, I'll tell you, one of things I'm proud of is for someone from Southern California, who didn't grow up around coal mines, I learned a lot that tragic day we lost twenty-nine miners at Upper Big Branch coal mine.","At times you feel like you're the only voice speaking out to improve the working conditions of people, whether it's to be able to collectively bargain, to get adequate pay, to know that you can come home safe out of a coal mine.","My role was to bring about fairness in the workplace.

I've been to many, many beaches on many continents: Mombasa, the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas, Bermuda, Barbados, Mexico and the U.S. What's beautiful about beach communities is for whatever reason, they feel like vacation to me.","My father, obviously, and my mother were inspirations. My uncle, Frank Harper, he was an absolute mentor for me.","I believe that reality TV should be called 'not reality' TV; it's fiction.","You can live a healthy lifestyle and do the best to be aware of your body and conscious, and that's what I attempt to do.","Dr. King said, 'We are all tied together in a garment of mutual destiny.'

I'm not going to move.","We are human beings. We operate from wanting to be rewarded.","I've done romantic comedy, and I don't get to flex that muscle often.","Most people aren't honest with themselves about money.","I say 'date potential.'

You never know what's really going on behind what they present.","Money is important. It is an important resource to have to help us build the life we want, but we overvalue it.","Screening for colon cancer can stop cancer in its tracks.","I would suggest that folks who have a platform of so-called celebrity, to the extent that they don't use that platform, or if they just use it for their own self-aggrandizement, it is certainly fed in a way that it goes to waste.","I'm not the biggest star in the world, but I do have a platform, and if I can use that platform to help somebody else, why wouldn't I?","You're in a situation where you have limited education opportunities, you don't have any money, you can't get a job; what are you going to do? You're going to go back to this criminal network that you actually made while you were in prison.","I studied theater in college, and I absolutely knew that I loved acting, and I knew that I loved theater.","Roles make the actor.","I believe we all have the capacity to be masters of many things, and there's nothing that we can't do.

But somehow, life tries to convince us that we'd be lucky to do even one thing well, and I disagree.","There are so many actors that I meet that don't act enough.

It starts with writers. Writers are the most important piece of the entire puzzle.","I love making films, but the best roles are hard to come by.","Here's the deal: I believe - and I attempt to live my life this way - we all have more time than we think we do. We all waste so much time.","When I'm acting, that's all I'm doing. When I'm not acting, I'm not thinking about acting.

What happened with that is a lot of young men would reach out to me.","I'm really proud of the characters I've been able to play. Certainly, playing the character on 'CSI' as Dr. Sherman Hawkes is a wonderful stereotype-busting role.","Whenever there's an opportunity to celebrate the written word and celebrate the folks that read the written word, and, I think, to encourage other writers to write and encourage folks to read more and get connected to it in a personal way, it's a positive thing.","For me, self-esteem-building and confidence-building is the foundation for anything that we do, whether you want to be a writer, a painter, or a entrepreneur.","It's important for someone like me - who's known Obama for 20 years - to speak the truth.

So the younger you are, the more ability you have to hold money longer term.","I've read a number of relationship books out there.

It's a hard choice and it's controversial, and that's why I'm pro-choice, because I want people to make their own choices.","People can judge me for what I've done.

It puts people's lives in danger, threatens our national security, and undermines our efforts to work with other countries to solve shared problems.","In almost every profession - whether it's law or journalism, finance or medicine or academia or running a small business - people rely on confidential communications to do their jobs.

When someone breaches that trust, we are all worse off for it.","I am, you know, adamantly against illegal immigration.","Gay rights are human rights.","I used to sit on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue and wonder why the Senate was always going into recess, until in my first year I realized how intense the pressure was.","It is often when night looks darkest, it is often before the fever breaks that one senses the gathering momentum for change, when one feels that resurrection of hope in the midst of despair and apathy.","If a country doesn't recognize minority rights and human rights, including women's rights, you will not have the kind of stability and prosperity that is possible.","This is what we call smart power. Using every possible tool and partner to advance peace and security. Leaving no one on the sidelines. Showing respect even for one's enemies.

People can't say anything without offending somebody.","And to all of your supporters here and around the country: I want you to know, I've heard you. Your cause is our cause.

It was a terrible tragedy losing four Americans - two diplomats and, now it's public so I can say, two CIA operatives.","One of the great things about my mother is she really valued people's character more than what they did.","I'm undaunted in my quest to amuse myself by constantly changing my hair.","The challenges of change are always hard. It is important that we begin to unpack those challenges that confront this nation and realize that we each have a role that requires us to change and become more responsible for shaping our own future.","I'm not going to have some reporters pawing through our papers. We are the president.","The challenge is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible, possible.","Today we voted as Democrats and Republicans. Tomorrow we begin again as New Yorkers.","One day after laying a wreath at the tomb of Martin Luther King Jr., President Bush appoints a federal judge who has built his career around dismantling Dr. King's legacy.","In the aftermath of September 11, and as the 9/11 Commission report so aptly demonstrates, it is clear that our intelligence system is not working the way that it should.","The American taxpayer should not be treated more shabbily than debtors from other nations and we should be encouraging other nations to help rebuild Iraq's economy.","Many of you are well enough off that the tax cuts may have helped you. We're saying that for America to get back on track, we're probably going to cut that short and not give it to you. We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good.","I believe in a zone of privacy.","Every nation has to either be with us, or against us. Those who harbor terrorists, or who finance them, are going to pay a price.","For centuries, New York has served as the gateway for millions of people from all over the world in search of the American dream. It only makes sense that it would now serve as a gateway for the world's greatest athletes.","In too many instances, the march to globalization has also meant the marginalization of women and girls. And that must change.","We have a close, unshakable bond between the United States and Israel, and between the American and Israeli people. We share common values and a commitment to a democratic future for the world, and we are both committed to a two-state solution. But that doesn't mean that we're going to agree.","As I speak to you today, government censors somewhere are working furiously to erase my words from the records of history. But history itself has already condemned these tactics.","Both the American people and nations that censor the internet should understand that our government is committed to helping promote internet freedom.","Countries that will not tax their elite who expect us to come in and help them serve their people are just not going to get the kind of help from us that historically they may have.","I think I will serve as secretary of state as my last public position.","I feel very lucky because of my parents and then my education, the opportunities that I've had, so I would like to continue working to improve lives for others.","Every president, if you watch what they look like when they come into office, you can see their hair turn white because it's such a hard job.","I will not comment on or confirm what are alleged to be stolen State Department cables. But I can say that the United States deeply regrets the disclosure of any information that was intended to be confidential, including private discussions between counterparts or our diplomats' personal assessments and observations.","I think that we have to be constantly asking ourselves, 'How do we calculate the risk?' And sometimes we don't calculate it correctly; we either overstate it or understate it.","We would very much like to see Iran take a position as a responsible leader that doesn't intimidate or threaten or scare its neighbors and others. But the choice is really up to Iran and we're going to keep working to try to come out with the right decision.","You can't just give a speech and expect people to fall down and agree with you.","Individual consciences are fine but individual consciences have to be made manifest.","I sometimes think that I didn't leave the Republican Party, as much as it left me.","Democracy is still a radical idea in a world where we often confuse images with realities, words with actions.","Now I know that Wal-Mart's policies do not reflect the best way of doing business and the values that I think are important in America.","The importance of building relationships among colleagues, of trying to create coalitions behind the issues that you are championing, was not something I ever had much insight into until I was elected and started serving in the Senate.","I've always been intrigued by the Senate, and admired many of the people who have served there.","We know in New York we have several million at any one time who are in New York illegally.","Children today will grow up taking for granted that an African-American or a woman can, yes, become the president of the United States.","There is a hunger for the United States to be present again.","We can't go to people who have lost their job at GM and say, 'Oh, by the way, we are going to pay money to build a road here or inoculate children there,' unless we can demonstrate that it is in America's interest. I happen to think it is.","There's a certain consistency to who I am and what I do, and I think people have finally said, 'Well, you know, I kinda get her now.' I've actually had people say that to me.","It should never be a crime to be gay.","I feel like I have had the most amazing life in my public service.","When an army unit returns from service in Iraq or Afghanistan, it barely gets a breather before it begins training for its next deployment.","The truth is that sometimes it is hard even for me to recognize the Hillary Clinton that other people see.","My father was raised with brothers, he was a football player and a boxer, he was a chief petty officer in the Navy, he was a man of his times.","Going out and playing football or baseball with the boys, when I was a tomboy, was a great way to learn about winning and losing, and most girls didn't have that experience.","In my family, we were Americans, we were Republicans and we were Methodists.","I'm too old to be a yuppie.","I'm one of these very focused people when it comes to day-to-day work, and I'm trying not to think about what comes next so that I can stay very focused on what I'm doing now.","I've been really at the highest levels of American political life.","I think it's fair to say that diplomacy today requires much more of that if you're the United States of America than it did 10, 20, 30, 40 years ago.","In every country today, there is politics. It may be authoritarian politics, but there is politics.","When my hair was shorter, I used to get it done every couple of days... but I got tired of that.","I have won elections and I have lost elections.","I feel like every day, every minute I have to make the most of.","I am neither frustrated nor planning anything other than being the best Secretary of State I could be.","I love New York.","I am shocked at how much time I spend in the White House. I mean, you know, for people on the outside, the idea of going to the White House for a meeting must seem like the most important, serious, even glamorous kind of thing to do.","I always run inclusive and successful organisations.","I certainly don't read coverage of me, I read what else is going on that I need to know about to do my job.","I've had extraordinary good luck with my health, other than a broken elbow.","I won the youth vote in Massachusetts and in California. I did very well with it in Ohio.","When you're the presidential nominee you get to pick whomever you choose to be on the ticket, and that person gets to say yes or no because, obviously, it's a very important decision.","I don't think we should be about the business of denying voters in Michigan and Florida the right to be heard.","Egypt is a large, complex, very important country.","What I found when I became Secretary of State was a lot of doubts and a lot of concerns and fears from friends, allies, around the world.","Well, I think, by definition, all power has limits.","One of my goals upon becoming Secretary of State was to take diplomacy out of capitals, out of government offices, into the media, into the streets of countries.","The first lesson I've learned is that no matter what you do in your life, you have to figure out your own internal rhythms - I mean, what works for you doesn't necessarily work for your friend.","I take vitamins.","I try to read for pleasure whenever I can - it's a great way just to shut it off for a while so your brain doesn't get fried.","I always supported the women I worked with having time off to go to parent-teacher conferences and doctors' appointments or bringing their infants into the office.","You know no one will ever accuse me as having the same policies as George W. Bush.","A nuclear-weapons armed Iran is not in anyone's human-rights interests. That is a direct threat to the lives and the livelihoods and the stability not only of the region but beyond.","I am someone who hopes for the best and prepares for the worst.","Now, I know there are many Americans who say, 'Get out of Afghanistan. Bring 'em all home.' And there are others who say, 'Put in hundreds of thousands of more.'","You know, my view is that we have a big world out there.","I believe in delegating power.","I meet with people all day long.","The nuclear arsenal that Pakistan has, I believe is secure. I think the government and the military have taken adequate steps to protect that.","The safe haven that al-Qaida has found in Pakistan is very troubling.","I don't think that strategically it is smart to begin cutting your options when the other side does not move at all.","I don't have any comment on who the people of Russia choose to be their leaders.","I think we have to face the reality that in a society where there is a legitimate threat of terrorism, not being able to see one's face, not being able to have some sense of communication in that way, is for many societies a challenge.","Europe is a miracle.","Democracies have to be careful that they do not become so process-driven.","I can't stand the kind of paralysis that some people fall into because they're not happy with the choices they've made.","I'm in charge of the State Department's 60,000-plus people all over the world, 275 posts.","I mean, I'm a big believer in talking to people when you can and trying to solve problems when you can.","'Smart power' is the use of American power in ways that would help prevent and resolve conflict - not just send our military in.","When I was growing up, my parents always told me that I had to do what I thought was right and not listen to other people. That was hard for me.","I think the world would be a lot better off if more people were to define themselves in terms of their own standards and values and not what other people said or thought about them.","I want to make a difference.","When does life start? When does it end? Who makes these decisions?... Every day, in hospitals and homes and hospices... people are struggling with those profound issues.","You cannot have development in today's world without partnering with the private sector.","One of the things I have been preaching around the world is collecting taxes in an equitable manner, especially from the elites.","It is a fact that around the world the elites of every country are making money.","I just think that giving a child a chance and sharing what you have with a child is one of the greatest gifts you can give yourself, as well as a child.","Every marriage is a mystery to me, even the one I'm in. So I'm no expert on it.","At the end of the day, you know, love does not happen between two perfect people as much as we would wish.","I'm one of those people who thinks that changing one's hair is the only part of the body that you can change at will.","I wish I were taller and thinner but the hair you can do something about.","I don't ask anyone else to live my life. I have enough trouble doing that.","There is no formula that I'm aware of for being a successful or fulfilled woman today.","I mean, honestly, we have to be clear that the life for many Afghan women is not that much different than it was a hundred years ago, 200 years ago. The country has lived with so much violence and conflict that many people, men and women, just want it to be over.","It's true that America can't solve every problem, but I don't know of any major problem in the world that can be solved without us.","I was in civil society long before I was ever in politics or my husband was ever even elected president.","China is starting an English-speaking television network around the world, Russia is, Al Jazeera. And the BBC is cutting back on its many language services around the world.","I think I'm very hardheaded.","India has reduced its dependence on Iranian oil. I know their refineries have stopped asking for orders to purchase Iranian oil.","Sometimes overturning brutal regimes takes time and costs lives. I wish it weren't so. I really, really do.","Sometimes, in public life, people ask inappropriate, off-the-wall kinds of questions, don't they?","A psychologist once told me that for a boy being in the middle of a conflict between two women is the worst possible situation. There's always a desire to please each one.","Everybody has some dysfunction in their families.","I have to defend my husband.","Several people have told me that one of the most meaningful events they could attend would be something at the White House with their children.","Well I think in a marriage you have to be honest and ask yourself, you know, what is my role? What is my responsibility?","I don't think I've read any of the books that have been written about me.","I never thought that the long haired, bearded guy I married in law school would end up being President.","The people of New York took a big chance on me. And I'm well aware of that.","You know, I think of the global economy as an inverted triangle, resting on the shoulders of the American consumer. And if the American consumer cannot have enough disposable income in order to maintain a standard of living that creates more opportunities generation after generation, that's bad for everybody.","There hasn't been anybody whose life has been picked apart and distorted as much as mine.","I, for one, respect those who believe with all their hearts and conscience that there are no circumstances under which any abortion should ever be available.","Don't let anybody tell you it's corporations and businesses create jobs. You know that old theory, 'trickle-down economics.' That has been tried, that has failed. It has failed rather spectacularly.","You know, one of the things my husband says when people say 'Well, what did you bring to Washington,' he said, 'Well, I brought arithmetic.'","Great nations need organizing principles, and 'Don't do stupid stuff' is not an organizing principle.","When you're down on yourself, and when you are hunkering down and pulling back, you're not going to make any better decisions than when you were aggressively, belligerently putting yourself forward.","Israel has a right to defend itself.","I have been working or attending school full time since I was 13.","I've been in the hospital once when I had my daughter, and, oh, when I broke my elbow, but other than that, I've been very fortunate.","If you get so unequal that people believe they don't have a chance, that the field isn't level for them and their children, that puts democracy at risk.","I will read anything by Laura Hillenbrand, Walter Isaacson, Barbara Kingsolver, John le Carre, John Grisham, Hilary Mantel, Toni Morrison, Anna Quindlen and Alice Walker.","My favorite short stories are by Alice Munro, especially her collections 'Carried Away' and 'Runaway.'","Cooking, decorating, diet/self-help and gardening books are guilty pleasures and useful time fillers.","When I traveled as secretary of state, I was deluged with thick briefing books full of information about the politics, economy, and culture of each destination, so those took up most of my reading time.","I thought making speeches for money was a much better thing than getting connected with any one group or company, as so many people who leave public life do.","I've spent so many years commuting, I kind of prefer a home office.","Hard men present hard choices - none more so than Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia.","When I chose to leave a career as a young lawyer in Washington to move to Arkansas to marry Bill and start a family, my friends asked, 'Are you out of your mind?'","I was not going to attack Palin just for being a woman appealing for support from other women.","When you have armed militants, aided and abetted by a major country like Russia, able to use surface-to-air missiles to bring down a commercial airline, that is a form of terrorism.","With respect to Iraq, I did favour the continuity of American forces to work with the new Maliki government. They had enormous needs for intelligence, for training on everything from airplanes to more sophisticated ground equipment and the like.","Iran has basically propped up Assad, who has waged an absolute war of horror against the Syrian people. And he has done anything he could to stay in power with the full support of the Iranians and including Iranian troops and Hezbollah from Lebanon, which are an Iranian proxy.","You don't make peace with your friends. That's the bottom line. You end conflicts by trying to find some political resolution.","I am not going to comment on what I did or did not say back in the late '90s.","I am 100% in the camp that says forgiveness is mostly about the forgiver.","Hamas, we know, embeds missiles, embeds command-and-control units in civilian areas.","Everybody feels they have been trespassed upon, and nearly everybody has trespassed on somebody else, maybe not intentionally.","I would be delighted if the United States could have a positive relationship with Russia, and I would be thrilled if the Russian people, who are so capable, had a normal country that they could chart a different future.","When it comes to the Middle East, this is always a very difficult issue for any American president.","I learned to be far more skeptical of what I'm told by presidents, no matter who the presidents are, and also to be much more cautious, always, in any action or vote that could lead to the use of American military power and most particularly what we call 'boots on the ground.'","I helped to restore America's leadership.","I respect the Congress's oversight responsibility.","The most important questions for anybody thinking of running for president are not 'Will you run and can you win?' There is, 'What is your vision for America? And can you lead us there?'","Putin is playing the long game. He has a strategic plan in mind: the Eurasian Union, which would be in competition to Europe.","George W. Bush is very popular in Sub-Saharan Africa. Why? Because of PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Program for AIDS Relief.","I think every election is sui generis. I think it starts with where we are in the country at this time, with what Americans are thinking, feeling and hoping, and it proceeds from there. And it is always about the future.","Americans deserve to feel secure in their own lives, in their own middle-class aspirations, before you go to them and say, 'We're going to have to enforce navigable sea lanes in the South China Sea.'","When I negotiated the ceasefire in Gaza with President Morsi, he was, you know, very involved.","One of the biggest problems that Egypt faces is the lack of border security - the importation of weapons on their way to Gaza, for example, coming out of Sudan.","American politics is always an open competition.","I really get up every day and try to deal with the problems that are in front of me, and I don't really worry about history. That will work itself out over time.","There is nothing fast or easy about diplomacy. I have no illusions about that.","I want to work with my husband and my daughter on our mutual foundation interests.","I have a lot of reason to believe, as we saw in the 2012 election, most Americans don't agree with the extremists on any side of an issue, but there needs to continue to be an effort to find common ground, or even take it to higher ground on behalf of the future.","There are some people in politics and in the press who can't be confused by the facts. They just will not live in an evidence-based world. And that's regrettable.","My overall goal is to level the playing field for American businesses.","I believe that eventually, one of the next big issues that will have to be addressed globally is the role of state-owned enterprises. Because there is a disadvantage that's built in.","If you can't compete fairly, honestly, effectively, no government should intervene. Now, some governments do. They prop up failing industries.","When women participate in peace-making and peace-keeping, we are all safer and more secure.","Struggles do not end when countries attempt the transition to democracy.","I've often thought that the gauntlet of American politics is more individualistic, more expensive, more unpredictable than in many other democracies.","My father was a small-businessman, and if he didn't get up and go to work, there would be no business.","When I became secretary of state, I felt one of my primary jobs was building relationships around the world.","Women standing up for each other is critically important.","I happen to have given lots of free speeches.","I have known several presidents quite well, including my husband, and I worked closely with President George W. Bush and the White House then after 9/11, and I served with President Obama. I disagree with all three of those presidents on certain things.","I had a family that supported me.","Remember, before they called it Obamacare, they called it Hillarycare.","I represented Wall Street, as a senator from New York, and I went to Wall Street in December of 2007 - before the big crash that we had - I basically said, 'Cut it out! Quit foreclosing on homes! Quit engaging in these kinds of speculative behaviors.'","We are still living with a double standard. I know it. Every woman I know knows it, whether you're in the media as a woman, or you're in the professions or business or politics.","I am repeating the facts and the facts are I did not send nor did I receive material marked classified.","Most importantly I never sent classified material on my email and I never received any that was marked classified.","I had a personal email when I was in the Senate, as the vast majority of senators do. It was very convenient. I did all of my business on personal emails."],"Hillary Scott":["We want to stay on this tour bus together as long as we possibly can. I'm sure a lot of bands are like, 'I need my own space.' But we don't. I want to be with these guys forever.","I wanted to be a vet, a nurse, a chef - I mean, anything but the music industry. But once I hit high school, the bug really bit me. You can't deny where you come from and what's in your genes, and music definitely was. I haven't looked back since.","I love the excitement, the childlike spirit of innocence and just about everything that goes along with Christmas.","You pretty much can't get away from bacon or whiskey in the South. Put a doughnut in it and you'd be good to go.","The three of us just try put our heads down and stay creative. The awards truly are just cake. It's one of those things that you never expect, but getting the head nod from either the fans or your peers, that's the ultimate compliment.","It's like these songs are your babies and you don't want anybody to think your babies are ugly! You never really know until you throw it out there if it's gonna take. And that is a really scary and vulnerable place to be, so having those songs be embraced is the best feeling in the world. That's been our dream our whole lives.","I'm not a tanning bed person at all, but I'll get a spray tan.","Chris proposed exactly the way I've always dreamed. Our families were close by, but it was just us out on a beautiful deck overlooking a lake in East Tennessee. We had just been on a hike and - in our workout clothes - he hit the knee! We feel so blessed by God that He sent us each other, and we are looking so forward to forever together.","Being the only girl, I feel a lot of pressure. I try not to think about it, but I definitely get in the gym a lot more frequently towards awards season. The guys always look great. They're both great looking and wear a good suit and a great tie and some awesome shoes and they're good to go. I'm like, 'I don't know what to do!'","In high school I was the manager of the football team, so being around boys is natural to me!","It's like these songs are your babies and you don't want anybody to think your babies are ugly! You never really know until you throw it out there if it's gonna take.","Honestly, being in a band with two guys has prepared me so much for when it's time for me to get married!","'Need You Now' is a universal subject matter. It's something that not just country fans, not just pop fans - everybody's been there. And the production was a little left of center.","My parents traveled a lot, so my grandparents practically raised me. My grandmother and I really bonded in the kitchen. She's this amazing southern cook, and I would always help her - whether it was cracking eggs or stirring the green beans. It takes me back there.","My biggest celebrity crush is either Ryan Reynolds or Caleb Followill, the lead singer of Kings of Leon.","I'll never forget when we played Shepherd's Bush in London. We played 'I Run To You', and we put the mic out for the last chorus, and you could hear them singing the chorus with the beautiful accent that they have.","If I had to name one thing that probably causes more conflict within the band, it's probably the fact that I'm the girl, and it takes much longer with hair and makeup and wardrobe. But they've gotten used to it. It's one of those things I think they realize that when they say she'll be ready in 10 minutes, it normally means 15 or 20.","I absolutely love the fact that they are looking out for me and it's not really even just Charles and Dave. Out on the road, I'm one of very few girls out here. There's a lot of pseudo big brothers who are keeping an eye out on me.","You learn how to compromise and you learn how to read each other. Honestly, being in a band with two guys has prepared me so much for when it's time for me to get married!","When you are pushing yourself to not go back to the same well, you're gonna come up with something different, or you'll find songs that are different.","I was homeschooled on the road for kindergarten, then went to elementary school and a private Christian school while living with my grandparents until I graduated, and I loved it. But my parents were gone a lot.","There's a song called 'All We'd Ever Need,' which is actually the first song that the three of us wrote together on our first album, and when we wrote that song I didn't have any real experience to pull from.","We have a song like 'Ready to Love Again' that is really, really special to me. It's the one that I relate to the most. It's very personal, so we really allowed ourselves to go there and be vulnerable and show the fans that we feel and we hurt and we love just like anybody else does. I hope they feel that when they hear it.","I'm kind of old-fashioned, so I think the guy should always be the one to call. The girl just answers... Or doesn't answer.","Guys are really easy to get along with. It's a lot better than being on the bus with eight girls. But the worst part is being the only girl, because there's some days where you just wanna watch a chick flick.","There are so many music genres competing against each other, but I feel like country music has always been a unified front.","I've been told I'm an old soul, but I'm only 25. I have the old with the new in me, and my house reflects that."],"Hilton Als":["Boredom means you develop your own interior life.","I used to think that the feeling of alienation that I would have was just me, but I realise that it's also a symptom of the modern world.","If you have a word of encouragement, you can do anything.","Of course a magazine is shaped by its editor, and each editor is different.","People have a copyright on their own life.","Racism seduces us with its desire to categorize, shutting out the living and breathing and 'different' world all around us.","Black excellence is a thing. People - from Beyonce Knowles to Venus and Serena Williams to folks you haven't heard of - are into it. It's less a movement than a standard: believers set the bar high not only for themselves but also for others who share their vision, especially when it pertains to black history, stories, and style.","My self encompasses a lot of different things.","I never feel like I've done anything. Swear to God. I'm not kidding. So it's always a surprise when somebody asks me to do anything.","'Moonlight' undoes our expectations as viewers, and as human beings, too. As we watch, another movie plays in our minds: real-life footage of the many forms of damage done to black men, which can sometimes lead them to turn that hateful madness on their own kind, passing on the poison that was their inheritance.","I grew up in a largely black community during the '70s and '80s that scoffed at 'white' music. That music - folk, rock, some disco - was considered soulless, aberrant, just one more example of the Caucasian's desire to scream and yell and demand whatever their privilege and perpetual adolescence dictated they should demand.","I'm one of those crazy people who have to write every day. Otherwise, I feel really sort of despondent, and it's because I don't feel very happy about not learning.","Inspiration takes many forms, but it's rarely pure.","My mother reveres artists, and my sister and I have inherited her love of art and the stories about its creation.","Our wishes are our most reliable mirror, and the black-and-white movies I'm most drawn to are about artists who suffer because art is a noble thing; suffering is such a small price to pay for the imagination.","I think that Tyler Perry's genius really has been to tap into the domestic market. He knows what his audience is based on, having toured America for so long, and then giving them the blueprint for his films prior to the films coming out, and then the films have the built-in audience because they've seen it in theaters already.","Dramas about addiction can be exciting to watch. And then dispiriting. Exciting because degradation is fascinating to follow from the relative safety and smugness of an 'appropriate' life, and dispiriting because if all that sad mayhem can happen to this or that character, what's to keep it from happening to me or you?","I think that when I'm telling a story, I'm doing the best I can to tell the story as fully as I can, and if there are various fractures that happen in the story, then that's just the very thing that the story is as opposed to my looking for avenues of difference in one story. They just really do exist. For me, anyway.","I think that writers are best served by sticking to their writing. Not having loads of theories about the best way to position the writing. I think that if the writing is good and the point of view is strong, the writing is going to take care of itself.","I am always attracted to people who are not myself but are.","I have not seen 'The Lion King.' I don't do black folklore. And I'm black.","It's very hard to find artists in the history of western art who don't make portraiture ideological in some way.","I think what we're attracted to on the page is something that is very difficult to do in life, which is to examine in what seems like a moment. To examine what we can't do in life very well, which is to be as present and accountable to what an experience is. That's why life is short and art is very long.","If you want to take writing on, you should pay writing the respect it deserves, which is to say, reading it.","American musicals are, for the most part, about boys, or boyish pursuits and aspirations - the fantasy of freedom and resolve - and those dreams have little to do with the reality of most black women's lives.","I don't think that there are many, many strong, black male role models who provide a certain kind of really American, Southern-based comfort that Madea grows out of. She's a signpost in our Obama world of traditional Christian values.","I think someone like Khandi Alexander, who's now on 'Treme,' is one of the most extraordinary actresses I've seen in years. But she's dependent on someone brilliant like David Simon to realize that and to give her a forum. Tyler Perry's not interested in that kind of nuance because it doesn't sell.","It's dollars before art in Hollywood.","Julius Eastman is the kind of American genius not enough people know about.","In the contemporary world, artists are almost entirely self-referential.","Broadway is not about surprises. It's about rewarding the putrid, formulaic crap that makes Broadway Broadway.","I love writing. Writing has been very good to me.","My love of performers is not really different than my love for painters. Everyone's really high-strung and trying to do the best they can.","Women have an ability to be still in a way men don't.","I believe that one reason I began writing essays - a form without a form, until you make it - was this: you didn't have to borrow from an emotionally and visually upsetting past, as one did in fiction, apparently, to write your story.","I think writing is an act of remembrance, I think that Instagram is an act of remembrance, and I think curating a show is an act of memory, too.","I think I'm just generally more interested in figuration than abstraction. I think that painting abstraction often feels like painting colors to me, whereas portraits always feel like something connected. I like the exchange, the collaborative aspect of sitter and subject for sure.","In general, what we really want is a feeling when we read anything that the author has explored the territory as dutifully and as thoroughly as their spirit allows and as their heart allows.","I envy poets because nobody ever asks them if it's true or false.","I was an actor for a little bit. That's when I started to understand fiction - and that one of the great things about fiction is that you're dependent on the characters as much as they're dependent on you.","Nothing is more flattering for a writer than when someone knows your work.","What I feel is there are certain demands that you have to satisfy in any piece of writing. When it's just for me, it's just for me, but if it's a piece for a particular publication, I know what they're going to ask for.","If I feel like I haven't really tapped into the essence of the story when I do an assignment, I may revisit it on my own, and that's when I feel freer to add my imagination. But I think that if you feel imaginatively towards a subject, you really shouldn't do it in a journalistic context, because then you're just fabricating, and that's crazy.","One of the things I liked about writing for a magazine was a kind of anonymity. When you do books, it's different than magazine pieces because you become a 'figure.'","One of the things that's great about writing for a magazine is that every week you get to be a different person. You're writing different things all the time and not slogging along for years on something.","Eminem was someone that I discovered I liked, largely because of his relationship to language and to his mother.","When you work at a magazine, you have to tell the truth. When you're not working in that format, it's fun to see where your mind takes you when the dictates have nothing to do with anyone but yourself.","I think one of the things that started to hinder Baldwin as an artist later on was that he became really aware of power, so he wanted it, too. But if you look at the work before that, before 'The Fire Next Time' put him on the cover of 'Time Magazine,' it was much more intimate and a much more internal conversation.","I didn't like '12 Years a Slave' because it was playing to the Spielbergian model of redemption.","I'm not one of those people who's against all-black productions of Tennessee Williams plays, but there are lot more complex and natural ways to bring people of color into the theater.","There is not enough time for anything, ever.","I suppose that there are many novels that are set during the summer because it's a lonely time of year. Friends come and go, comfort comes and goes, which makes it a perfect time of year to indulge in melancholia.","I'm attracted to people who work their little plot of land and cultivate it and cultivate it.","I love Andre Leon Talley as a person.","I don't know what else teaches you as much as writing. Perhaps reading. So if I don't have one or the other in the course of the day, I feel old.","I think that you don't really want to write a book that doesn't really move people and doesn't get them to think.","I think, what's the point of writing a book that you would get in one sitting?","Although the civil-rights movement did a lot to change how black life was dramatized on the American stage in the fifties and sixties, white composers and lyricists often still rely on familiar tropes when it comes to representing black women in musicals.","For black people, being around white people is sometimes like taking care of babies you don't like."],"Hippocrates":["Healing is a matter of time, but it is sometimes also a matter of opportunity.","Wherever the art of medicine is loved, there is also a love of humanity.","Walking is man's best medicine.","Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.","Whenever a doctor cannot do good, he must be kept from doing harm.","Everything in excess is opposed to nature.","Natural forces within us are the true healers of disease.","Make a habit of two things: to help; or at least to do no harm.","Cure sometimes, treat often, comfort always.","If we could give every individual the right amount of nourishment and exercise, not too little and not too much, we would have found the safest way to health.","It's far more important to know what person the disease has than what disease the person has.","The life so short, the craft so long to learn.","There are in fact two things, science and opinion; the former begets knowledge, the later ignorance.","It is more important to know what sort of person has a disease than to know what sort of disease a person has.","Science is the father of knowledge, but opinion breeds ignorance.","A physician without a knowledge of Astrology has no right to call himself a physician.","Prayer indeed is good, but while calling on the gods a man should himself lend a hand.","Extreme remedies are very appropriate for extreme diseases.","The art is long, life is short.","Many admire, few know.","What medicines do not heal, the lance will; what the lance does not heal, fire will.","Life is short, the art long.","A wise man should consider that health is the greatest of human blessings, and learn how by his own thought to derive benefit from his illnesses.","To do nothing is also a good remedy.","Keep a watch also on the faults of the patients, which often make them lie about the taking of things prescribed.","The chief virtue that language can have is clearness, and nothing detracts from it so much as the use of unfamiliar words."],"Hippolyte Taine":["I have studied many philosophers and many cats.

I wish to see all done that can be done for their encouragement, to assist them in acquiring property, in becoming intelligent, enlightened, useful, valuable citizens.","Go to the depot here, now, and what will you see? A well-dressed colored lady, with her little children by her side, whom she has brought up intelligently and with refinement, as much so as white children, comes to the cars, and where is she shown to? Into the smoking car, where men are cursing, swearing, spitting on the floor.","Have the colored people done anything to justify the prejudice against them that does exist in the hearts of so many white persons and, generally, of one great political party in this country? Have they done anything to justify it? No, sir.","While it is desirable to build up the colored race, we must not sacrifice our best and purest white friends.","The people of the North owe to the colored race a deep obligation that is no easy matter to fulfill.","I find that the prejudice in this country to color is very great, and I sometimes fear that it is on the increase.","I stand today on this floor to appeal for protection from the strong arm of the government for her loyal children, irrespective of color and race, who are citizens of the southern states, and particularly of the State of Georgia.","While I appreciated the educational advantages I enjoyed in the school and was proud of what I could show in mental culture, I had an earnest desire for something more than a mere business education... I desired to study for a profession, and this prompted me to leave my native state.","I got colored mechanics in the United States Navy Yard for the first time.","It is evident that it is the belief of Christian people in this country and in all other enlightened portions of the world that as a nation, we have passed through a severe ordeal - that severe judgments have been poured out upon us on account of the manner in which a poor, oppressed race was treated in this country.","We are in the midst of an exciting canvass... I am working very hard in politics as well as in other matters. We are determined that Mississippi shall be settled on a basis of justice and political and legal equality.","I hold that establishing mixed schools will not harm the white race. I am their friend. I said in Mississippi, and I say here, and I say everywhere, that I would abandon the Republican party if it went into any measures of legislation really damaging to any portion of the white race, but it is not in the Republican party to do that.","I sedulously refrained from doing anything that would incite slaves to run away from their masters.","I was imprisoned in Missouri in 1854 for preaching the gospel to Negroes, though I was never subjected to violence.","The Legislature, which was elected under the Constitution framed and supported by colored men, declared that a man having more than an eighth of African blood in his veins was ineligible to office or a seat in the Legislature of the State of Georgia.","The Republican party is not inflamed, as some would fain have the country believe, against the South. Its borders are wide enough for all truly loyal men to find within them peace and repose from the din and discord of angry faction.","During the canvass in the State of Mississippi, I traveled into different parts of that state, and this is the doctrine that I everywhere uttered: that while I was in favor of building up the colored race, I was not in favor of tearing down the white race.","I maintain that the past record of my race is a true index of the feelings which today animate them. They bear toward their former masters no revengeful thoughts, no hatreds, no animosities. They aim not to elevate themselves by sacrificing one single interest of their white fellow-citizens.","The colored race saved to the noble women of New England and the middle States men on whom they lean today for security and safety. Many of my race, the representatives of these men on the field of battle, sleep in the countless graves of the South."],"Hirohito":["That most unfortunate war, which I deeply deplore.","The war has developed not necessarily to Japan's advantage."],"Hiromi Uehara":["For me, the keyboard is always an additional sound to the piano. Piano is the main instrument; I can't go anywhere without acoustic piano. It's been my best friend since I was 6 years old.","When I play music, I realize that it filters emotions. I believe that peoples' voices are expressed in their emotions, and I try to do the same with my music.","When you limit the word 'jazz' to one period of history, for the people who love that period, then maybe it can be dead because nobody plays like that anymore. But jazz is progressive music; it always has to progress, and musicians always have to find new landscapes and new ways to speak out, so of course it's always changing.","I sound like a crazy person... but I feel when a piano is happy, and I feel when they find that moment to be alive. I want them to remember me.","When there are no lyrics, people can picture what they want. It's a reflection of where they are in their lives. Music becomes a mirror.","The first time I listened to jazz was when I was 8.","You shouldn't think about technique when you play. You have to be you. It cannot be about, 'I can play this, and I can show you that.'","I don't really believe in genres. I don't want people to have any preconceptions about me. I want the first impression to be the music.","At a show, I'll look out from the stage and see a woman with a pearl necklace next to a guy in a Grateful Dead T-shirt next to a young kid with his mom. It's fun to see them all together.","I'm asked so many times why I think there aren't more female instrumentalists in jazz. But I never think about it. And I don't think it's been any harder for me to be taken seriously. The music speaks for itself.","I always have a will to write. It's organic to me.","I'm always interested in writing. I keep music in journals on an everyday basis. I'm always looking for ideas that can be music.","I'm hungry to learn, so I always have my big ears open fully, ready to learn every single minute when I play.","I feel so at home on the stage, and I love making people happy with my music. Whatever I have to go through to make that happen and get that sunshine is worth it.","I don't want to put a name on my music. Other people can put a name on what I do. It's just the union of what I've been listening to and what I've been learning. It has some elements of classical music, it has some rock, it has some jazz, but I don't want to give it a name.","'The Sound of Music' is one of my favourite old musical films.","Some people dig jazz, some people dig classical music, some people dig rock. Everyone is so concerned about who they like. They always say, 'This guy is the best,' 'No, this guy is the best.' But I think everyone is great. I really don't have barriers to any type of music. I could listen to everything from metal to classical music to anything else."],"Hiroshi Amano":["For me, it's my great honour that many people use blue LEDs or LED lightings now.

I would always fail in experiments, which I did at least three times a day."],"Hiroyuki Sanada":["It's hard for me to perform in English.","Sometimes I'm doing a big movie, or sometimes I'm doing a TV show, but as an actor, it's almost the same thing for me. If I'm doing action, or comedy, or something more heartfelt, it's a different approach, but it's all acting for me.","Action is just one of my skills.","If there is an action scene, I want to do everything myself.","I was very comfortable on the set of 'Lost'. I was so nervous when I went on to the set because I had just watched all the 'Lost' episodes. I was, like, a fan. A big fan."],"Hisham Matar":["Like all novelists, I'm interested in the filters between reality and the imagination.","Civil war is a national crisis and also a private trauma: We suffer it collectively and in isolation.","We have defeated Gaddafi on the battlefield; now we must defeat him in our imagination. We must not allow his legacy to corrupt our dream. Let's keep focused on the true prize: unity, democracy, and the rule of law. Let's not seek revenge; that would diminish our future.","I've never thought of myself in terms of an identity. I'm always baffled when I encounter someone who gives the impression about being confident about a particular defined identity.","Growing up in the Libya of the 1970s, I remember the prevalence of local bands who were as much influenced by Arabic musical traditions as by the Rolling Stones or the Beatles. But the project of 'Arabisation' soon got to them, too, and western musical instruments were declared forbidden as 'instruments of imperialism.'","One of the dark truths about dictators - and it applies to Gaddafi - is that on some level, they love their people. But it is a strange love. It says, 'I love you for me; I don't love you for you.' That rhymes with a certain kind of Libyan father who was always certain about what was good for those around him. Those fathers lose in the end.","The Arab Spring is a powerful and compelling response not only to an age of tyranny but also to the remnant chains of imperial influence.","Whenever I was encouraged by my elders to pick up a book, I was often told, 'Read so as to know the world.' And it is true; books have invited me into different countries, states of mind, social conditions and historical epochs; they have offered me a place at the most unusual gatherings.","I ultimately write for myself and the people I love.","Throughout my entire life, I have lived in the shadow of the dictatorship. It denied me safety and security.","My parents left Libya in 1979, escaping political repression, and settled in Cairo. I was nine.","In 2006, I published my first novel, 'In the Country of Men.' The publication of the book gave me a bigger platform to speak about my father's abduction and Libya's human-rights record.","In the same way that Egypt and Libya conspired to 'disappear' my father and silence writers such as Idris Ali, they made me, too, to a far lesser extent, feel punished for speaking out.","A revolution is not a painless march to the gates of freedom and justice. It is a struggle between rage and hope, between the temptation to destroy and the desire to build.","Dreams have consequences.","My earliest memory of books is not of reading but of being read to. I spent hours listening, watching the face of the person reading aloud to me.","The Arab Spring, with all of its failings and failures, exposed the lie that if we are to live, then we must live as slaves. It was an attempt to undermine not only the orthodoxy of dictatorship but also an international political orthodoxy where every activity must be approved by the profit logic of the 'ledger.'","We need a father to rage against.","Like most dictators, Col Gaddafi detests the metropolis. His vision of Libya is a kind of Bedouin romantic medievalism, suspicious of universities, theatres, galleries and cafes, and so monitors the cities' inhabitants with paranoid suspicion.","In the end, madness is worse than injustice, and justice far sweeter than freedom.","I am, by instinct, wary of revolutions. The gathering of the masses fills me with trepidation.","From before I was born, we Arabs have been caught between two forces that, seemingly, cannot be defeated: our ruthless dictators, who oppress and humiliate us, and the cynical western powers, who would rather see us ruled by criminals loyal to them than have democratically elected leaders accountable to us.","I can pinpoint the exact moment when I first began to think about what profession I should go into. It was 1978. I was seven and had just been handed over by the women of my family to the earnest and self-important gatherings of the men. I was no longer the responsibility of my aunts and older female cousins. I was now a man. This was a tragedy.","As a young boy in Libya, it was hard to escape the conclusion that the women were the most feeling and most functional part of society.","As part of the ritual of becoming a man, my maternal uncle, a judge, and his four sons, each older than me, took me deer hunting.","Over the centuries, close-knit tribes have played an important part in the cohesion of Libyan society.","Ivan Turgenev's novella 'First Love' is one of the most perfect things ever written.","The cost of Colonel Gaddafi's rule on Libyan society is incalculable.","Libyans are deeply unsettled by Gaddafi and his regime's careless contempt for human life. The dictatorship is willing to employ any methods necessary to remain in power.","We got rid of Muammar Gaddafi. I never thought I would be able to write these words.","Gaddafi tried to give a masterclass to men like the Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad, on how to crush a civilian uprising.","Turgenev's achievement lies in how he succeeded, in spite of himself, his country, and his time, in exempting his work from public duty. This has given it that unnameable quality that makes every sentence true, every silence trustworthy.","I don't remember a time when words were not dangerous.","Nothing makes you feel more stupid than learning a new language. You lose your confidence. You want to disappear. Not be noticed. Say as little as possible.","In Libya, I did well at school because I was clever. In Egyptian public school, I got the highest marks for the basest of reasons. And in the American school, I struggled. Everything - mathematics, the sciences, pottery, swimming - had to be conducted in a language I hardly knew and that was neither spoken in the streets nor at home.","Switching languages is a form of conversion. And like all conversions, whether it's judged a failure or a success, it excites the desire to leave, go elsewhere, adopt a new language and start all over again. It also means that a conscious effort is demanded to remain still.","Grenfell, the building set on fire with the help of its own face, is a scene of a complex injustice: one that is moral, economic, political, and aesthetic. Not only was the cladding unsafe, it was ugly; not only was it ugly, it was untrue both to the architecture of the building it covered and untrue to its responsibility to human safety.","One of the frustrations of prison life, which is also one of its intended consequences, is that the prisoner is made ineffective. He is unable to be of much use. The aim is to render him powerless.","When I was 12 years old, living in Cairo, my parents enrolled me in the American school. Most of the Americans there appeared oddly stifled, determined to remain, if not physically then sentimentally, back in the United States.","Books have shown me horror and beauty.","All great art allows us this: a glimpse across the limits of our self.","Nothing we read can import new or foreign feelings that we don't, in one form or another, already possess.","I get a lot of energy from making things up, which is why I feel I'm a novelist.","I am terribly interested in the paragraph: the paragraph as an object, the construction, and the possibilities of what a paragraph can do.","The space where writing happens is a unique space that's hard to define, and when you're kicked out of it because you're travelling or distracted, it seems so elusive and hard to defend because you yourself doubt whether it existed.","Great writing fills me with hopeful enthusiasm and never envy.","When a dictatorship imprisons someone or makes them disappear, it's actually a very strategic move. We forget that. It's not as senseless as it seems. It's a way to silence someone, but also it's a way to silence their family as well, out of fear, and society by extension.","I lost my father when I was 19, so the majority of my life has been under this cloud, and I have been full of the intention to find out what happened.","I used to believe that it was not possible to lose someone I loved without sensing it somehow, without feeling something shift. But it's not true. People can die, sometimes the closest people to us, without us noticing a thing.","I've never been particularly interested in genre distinctions. They seem to me more useful to a librarian than to a writer.","I used to be a keen rider. Sometimes I could sense what a horse liked or preferred to do.","I've always said - I've always said I'm not, by temperament, a romantic about revolutions or given to revolutions. I've always thought that they are not the ideal way to change.","My father, the political dissident Jaballa Matar, disappeared from his home in Cairo in March 1990.","My family settled in Cairo in 1980. I was nine. I missed Libya terribly, but I also took to Cairo. I perfected the accent. People assumed I was Egyptian.","My parents were fairly laid-back, but there were certain things about which they were very strict. My brother and I were told never to turn away a person in need. And it didn't matter what we thought of their motives, whether they were truly in need or not.","I don't believe people are interested in dates and facts. I don't think it is interesting to say what it is to be this person or that, but I do believe it is entertaining and perhaps even of value to express how it is to be that person.","I think my generation's inability to speak in absolute terms when it comes to politics is a very positive thing; it's made us more nuanced, made us more complex.","When you've been living in hope for a long time as I have, suddenly you realize that certainty is far more desirable than hope.","Some of the most powerful memories are those when you are very, very young. Adult life is seen through the reflection of complex, rational thought.","Living in hope is a really terrible thing.","There's something very bizarre about having a father who has disappeared. It's very hard to articulate.","I sometimes wonder if I would have become a writer if what happened to my father hadn't happened.","There are two voices: the first says write; the second hardly speaks, but I know what he wants. And if I let him, nothing would get done. He hovers at the edges.","I admire Turgenev, Camus, Proust and Shakespeare, but I've also learnt a lot about writing from composers and artists.","My father believed in armed struggle.","Audacity, hope, courage - the Libyans have these in abundance. But all those boring little things - like organization, building a committee - is hard; making decisions and moving ahead is hard.","From my family alone, Qaddafi had imprisoned five men.","Political dictatorships take possession not just of money and belongings but of narrative.","For an overwhelming majority of my life, my country has been a source of pain, fear, and embarrassment.","I am longing to see Libya rejoin the world as the internationalist Mediterranean country that it was.","Being my father's son is a kind of privilege.","Language is not just a code; you are writing into its history, into its tides.","To be okay with not knowing is a sign of a mature person and a mature society.","Architecture remains a passion and a subject I'm very interested in. I learned a great deal from studying it and working in it.","My best hope is that Libya turns into a peaceful, sensible country that has all the things my father and lots of others have been calling for: independence of the courts and press, a protected and democratic constitution, with different parties involved in a healthy and open debate.","My work is my shelter, particularly in these moments when things are happening fast.","One of the reasons why Gadafy's dictatorship has managed to remain in power for so long is not just because it has shown itself to be able to exact a great deal of violence, both psychological and physical, on its people, but because it has been very successful at imposing a narrative, a story.","To me, writing is like singing in the most inappropriate place, singing as beautifully as you can on a bus or in a bank, where people least expect it, and trying to get them to want to listen.","There is a tendency to over-exaggerate and over-romanticise the place of a writer in a revolution. That bothers me. I think it's inappropriate.","Making something of loss is, on some level, satisfying.","There's always a problem when you write, something you're trying to resolve, and sometimes a view can be inspiring.","I think, ultimately, I am a sensualist and an aesthete.","The romantic idea of the penniless writer is false. It's terrible. I hated being in debt. I hated the anxiety of not knowing whether we could pay our rent that month. Thankfully, I had a wife who was very supportive and had faith and shared my madness.","I've very aware of my rootlessness.","Gaddafi's ability to have survived so long rests on his convenient position in not being committed to a single ideology and his use of violence in such a theatrical way.","The laws of the lowly gangster govern Qaddafi and his sons.","It is evident that Qaddafi is mentally unwell. Like Richard III, he has barricaded himself within lies.","The Qaddafis, father and sons, speak the grammar of dictatorship: threats and bribery.","It is easy to underestimate the demands of an open heart.","I hope and pray that I'll be one of those fortunate people who have many, many books to write. I don't begrudge writing. I love the whole thing!","When I'm writing, my mood is very good - and I love life."],"Hit-Boy":["I'm trying to be like the old Roc- A-Fella and Bad Boy, influencing people culturally but having hits at the same time.","I had to learn how to think as a positive human being, before anything.","There was, like, a point where music was slow for me, like '09. I wasn't getting that much work.","Jay-Z called me onstage during my song that I produced for 'Watch the Throne?' That was surreal, man. One of those situations I'll never forget. I'll be able to show my kids the footage of when Jay-Z brought me onstage."],"Hjalmar Branting":["As a result of the World War and of a peace whose imperfections and risks are no longer denied by anyone, are we not even further away from the great aspirations and hopes for peace and fraternity than we were one or two decades ago?","But it is possible that, in the days ahead, these years we have lived through may eventually be thought of simply as a period of disturbance and regression.","The World War broke out with such elemental violence, and with such resort to all means for leading or misleading public opinion, that no time was available for reflection and consideration.","I do not overlook the fact that the appearance of these new, free nations in the European political community not only celebrates the return of the prodigal son but also creates new sources of friction here and there.","All in all, the League of Nations is not inevitably bound, as some maintain from time to time, to degenerate into an impotent appendage of first one, then another of the competing great powers.","And the annual meetings of the League's Assembly are in effect official peace congresses binding on the participating states to an extent that most statesmen a quarter of a century ago would have regarded as utopian.","Fraternity among nations, however, touches the deepest desire of human nature.","Let us return, however, to the League of Nations. To create an organization which is in a position to protect peace in this world of conflicting interests and egotistic wills is a frighteningly difficult task.","A formally recognized equality does, however, accord the smaller nations a position which they should be able to use increasingly in the interest of humanity as a whole and in the service of the ideal.","As long as the problem of world reconstruction remains the center of interest for all nations, blocs having similar attitudes will form and operate even within the League itself.","At Geneva, the neutral states were often in agreement concerning the preliminaries for Genoa, and Genoa itself was marked by a quite natural mutual exchange of ideas.","Before the war there were many who were more or less ignorant of the international labor movement but who nevertheless turned to it for salvation when the threat of war arose. They hoped that the workers would never permit a war.","It is a commonplace that the League of Nations is not yet-what its most enthusiastic protagonists intended it to be.","Last year, the Assembly of the League, as a result of the initiative taken by the Scandinavian nations, further limited and clarified all the provisions of the clause prescribing the duty of states to participate in sanctions.","No nation is so great as to be able to afford, in the long run, to remain outside an increasingly universal League of Nations.","The equality among all members of the League, which is provided in the statutes giving each state only one vote, cannot of course abolish the actual material inequality of the powers concerned.","The kind of support encouraged by such modes of expression has always arisen basically from confusing the fatherland itself with the social conditions which happened to prevail in it.","There is no reason why agreement on particular points should not be both possible and advantageous to the so-called neutrals and to one or more of the blocs, either existing or in the process of formation, within the League of Nations.","We here in the North have for many years had a natural tendency to feel that when our representatives come together at an international meeting, we embark on the quest of mutual understanding and support.","We must remember that the people for whom this change represents a first taste of freedom and a new and brighter future did not allow their resolution to falter, no matter how great the suffering by which they bought this independence."],"Hjalmar Schacht":["The economy is a very sensitive organism.","Germany stays and falls with the success of the policy of Hitler.","Only the closest collaborators of the Fuehrer know how difficult is the burden of this responsibility; how sorrowful are the hours during which decisions must be made which bear upon the well being and the fate of all of Germany.","It stands, essentially, for the application of increased energy to the efforts already undertaken by my ministry since 1934 with the results shown in the above statistics.","Instead of a weak and vacillating Government, a single, purposeful, energetic personality is ruling today.","With the aid of this credit policy, however, Germany created an armament second to none, and this armament in turn made possible the results of our policy.","Wherever my work may take me in the near future even if you should see me one day within the fortress - you can always count on me as your reliable assistant.","The very necessity of bringing our armament up to a certain level as rapidly as possible must place in the foreground the idea of as large returns as possible in foreign exchange and therewith the greatest possible assurance of raw material supplies, through exporting.","The Jews must realize that their influence in Germany has disappeared for all time.","The aim and the idea of the Four Year Plan were and remain entirely correct and necessary!","Since our economy is closely allied with that of foreign countries, not one of us can be indifferent to what consequences these disturbances can have at home and abroad.","Rules are to be initiated for the allotment of scarce raw materials etc; and their use and processing for other than war, or otherwise absolutely vital, goods is prohibited.","Material loss can be made up through renewed labor, but the moral wrong which has been inflicted upon the conquered peoples, in the peace dictates, leaves a burning scar on the people's conscience.","It has been shown that, in contrast to everything which classical national economy has hitherto taught, not the producer but the consumer is the ruling factor in economic life.","I can assure you that everything I say and do has the complete approval of the Fuehrer and that I would not say or do anything that does not have his approval.","Germany can generally only pay if the Corridor and Upper Silesia will be handed back to Germany from Polish possession, and if besides somewhere on the earth colonial territory will be made available to Germany.","But what you could perhaps do with in these days is a word of most sincere sympathy. Your movement is carried internally by so strong a truth and necessity that victory in one form or another cannot elude you for long.","But the memory of war weighs undiminished upon the people's minds. That is because deeper than material wounds, moral wounds are smarting, inflicted by the so- called peace treaties.","And this thesis is somewhat connected with general social and political observations, because it establishes the fact that the number of consumers is considerably larger than the number of producers, a fact which exercises a not inconsiderable social and political pressure.","After the many rumours that we had heard about Hitler and the published criticisms we had read about him, we were pleasantly impressed. His appearance was neither pretentious nor affected.","Allied supplies of arms to Russia, and the manpower reserves of Russia have been sufficient to bring continuous counter-attacks against our Eastern Front.","The German future lies in the hands of our Fuehrer.","The presentation of the Golden Badge of the Movement is the highest honor the Third Reich has to offer.","The repeated announcements that the Russian resistance was definitely broken have been proved to be untrue."],"Ho Chi Minh":["Nothing is more precious than independence and liberty.","It was patriotism, not communism, that inspired me.","Remember, the storm is a good opportunity for the pine and the cypress to show their strength and their stability.","You will kill 10 of our men, and we will kill 1 of yours, and in the end it will be you who tire of it.","The Vietnamese people deeply love independence, freedom and peace.

Apparently some in the Vietnamese government don't want to do that and that's their decision.","Love other human beings as you would love yourself.","I only follow one party: the Vietnamese party.","Write in such a way as that you can be readily understood by both the young and the old, by men as well as women, even by children.","But by reading them again and again finally I was able to grasp the essential part. What emotion, enthusiasm, enlightenment and confidence they communicated to me! I wept for joy."],"Hoagy Carmichael":["Never play anything that don't sound right. You might not make any money, but at least you won't get hostile with yourself.","I know Mother named me after a railroad man, but it's too late now, I'm afraid. Much, much too late.","The recollection of how, when and where it all happened became vague as the lingering strains hung in the rafters of the studio. I wanted to shout back at it, Maybe I didn't write you, but I found you.","This exploded in me almost more music than I could consume.","I don't think I'll ever be president of anything.","I'm singing the music publisher's theme song - it ain't a commercial.","In Hollywood, the rainbow hits the ground for composers.","Ragtime was my lullaby."],"Hobart Alter":["People laughed at me for setting up a surf shop.","The team we had, the Hobie Vita-Pakt Super Surfer team, you know, the Hilton boys were on there, Conrad Hilton's grandkids, and they were really good. After being around those kids, I could ride a little. Do a 360, some kick-turns, stuff like that.","In the surfing days, that was all there was for me. Sailing, starting around '68, it was kind of the same deal. I always got really into whatever it was I was doing.","On the manufacturing side, surfing was a lot harder than sailing. You had to find guys who could shape, who could glass, and you're looking for good people among all these surfers, you know. Keeping the quality up was always a problem.","Give me a few hours, and I can teach anyone how to get in and out on a Hobie. To get to the top level of competition, however, takes years. On a 16- or 18-footer, the total weight between the two people should range from 275-295, and you've gotta be a reasonably coordinated person to be any good at it.","I took Al Unser out on a Hobie the day before he became the first auto racer to go 200 mph around a closed-circuit track. We were only going about 18 mph, and you should have seen him hanging on for dear life.","In 1969, 'Life' magazine came up to me and said they wanted to do a little story on the Hobie, and I ended up getting a six-page spread. I remember Robert Redford was on the cover, and when that magazine hit the stands, it was a whole new ballgame."],"Hod Lipson":["Similar to computer technology in the '60s, 3-D printing is a universal technology that has the potential to revolutionize our life by enabling individuals to design and manufacture things.","We've seen computers play chess and beat grand masters. We've seen computers drive a car across a desert. But interestingly, playing chess is easy, but having a conversation about nothing is really difficult for a computer.","3D printing is already shaking our age-old notions of what can and can't be made.","The next episode of 3D printing will involve printing entirely new kinds of materials. Eventually we will print complete products - circuits, motors, and batteries already included. At that point, all bets are off.","If you gave kids peas that didn't look like peas and said they were a space shuttle, they're much more apt to eat them because it's now playtime.","A hexagonal piece of cheese is a lot better than a square piece of cheese.","Restrictions are difficult to enforce in a world where anybody can make anything.","I think, once recipes become digital, pirating a digital recipe and all the questions that you have with music and so forth will become pertinent to food as well.","The moment somebody is making money off the recipes, that's when you'll see digital rights management around it.","The only way to make something cheaply today is to have it mass-produced. For example, you wear the same shoes as everyone else. If you had a fabber, you could custom-make shoes that perfectly fit your feet. Three-dimensional printing will help us move away from the mass consumption that is so deeply ingrained in our culture.","Worrying about how you're going to make something is a huge constraint - most people can't make anything at home because it's too expensive.","We tend to think of science as finding equations, like E=MC2, that are simple and elegant. But maybe some theories are complicated, and we can only find the simple ones.","Basically, any material you can squeeze, melt or generate into a powder, you can print.","When it costs you the same amount of manufacturing effort to make advanced robotic parts as it does to manufacture a paperweight, that really changes things in a profound way.","So, where are the robots? We've been told for 40 years already that they're coming soon. Very soon they'll be doing everything for us. They'll be cooking, cleaning, buying things, shopping, building. But they aren't here. Meanwhile, we have illegal immigrants doing all the work, but we don't have any robots."],"Hoda Kotb":["People think that you have to do something huge, like go to Africa and build a school, but you can make a small change in a day. If you change Wednesday, then you change Thursday. Pretty soon it's a week, then a month, then a year. It's bite-size, as opposed to feeling like you have to turn your life inside out to make changes.","The days, months, and years eventually reveal, like a Polaroid, a clear picture of how significant events and decisions ultimately shape our lives.","Life is a series of baby steps along the way and if you add up these tiny little steps you take toward your goal, whatever it is, whether it's giving up something, a terrible addiction or trying to work your way through an illness. When you total up those baby steps you'd be amazed over the course of 10 years, the strides you've taken.","Tone is often the most important part of a conversation - and listening is so much more important than what you say.","I'm a huge karaoke person even though I have the worst singing voice. When you love doing something, who cares?","Sometimes when things are way too big and I can't control it, I do sort of a weird thing where I kind of check out a little bit. It's all about self-preservation for me.","If you have a friend or family member with breast cancer, try not to look at her with 'sad eyes.' Treat her like you always did; just show a little extra love.","I wake up at 4:15 A.M., get some coffee, turn on the news, see what's happening, go clickety-clack on the web to see what I missed overnight. Then I go to the gym, around 5:15, and I do what appears to be a very light workout, but who cares. I'm socializing with other nice people at the gym. Then I go into work, and I'm really awake.","'Ten Years Later' is about the journey six extraordinary people take with time. Each has experienced a game-changing event - perhaps a life-threatening illness or a catastrophic personal loss.","Having cancer empowered me to take more risks. I knew beating cancer was going to shape me, but it wasn't going to be all of me.","I have a horrible sweet tooth. It's gotten to the point where if I throw a cookie in the garbage, I have to douse it in Cascade. Otherwise, why wouldn't I take it out and eat it?","When you're a big girl like me, you want someone who makes you feel diminutive. I think fat guys are sexy.","I think after overcoming breast cancer, you sort of become fearless and somehow going up to your boss to talk about a possible promotion doesn't seem like such a daunting task anymore.","Sometimes you have to take the focus off of you and put it on someone else and it's funny what you can accomplish and how much strength you really have.","When I first came to NBC, I thought it was going to be swimming with the sharks, all men for themselves, be careful and all that. I have to tell you I learned that you can be kind and a hard worker and move up. You don't have to play dirty or do things that you think happens at big corporations.","From time to time, I'll look back through the personal journals I've scribbled in throughout my life, the keepers of my raw thoughts and emotions. The words poured forth after my dad died, when I went through a divorce, and after I was diagnosed with breast cancer. There are so many what-ifs scribbled on those pages.","I think credibility is one of those things that, if you work hard and you get it by standing in the trenches and traveling the world, people realize you're multi-faceted. Part of me is a serious journalist and I loved all of the stuff I did. And then there's another part of me that likes to let go and I think a lot of women can relate to that.","I'm an optimist, so I think everything can be worked out and fixed. But from having cancer I learned that even if you're even an optimist, sometimes you just have to face the facts that certain things are broken.","I'm a disorganized mess. My purse is gross: I once found a shoulder pad, string cheese, and a Christmas ornament in it!","I run in Central Park as the sun comes up. Some may mistake it for walking, but I swear I am running. I could not do it without my iPod.","I'm good at picking friends.","I've had weight issues all my life. I've been on all the diets: Atkins, liquid protein, Scarsdale diet. Now I go to the gym often. I'm always on the StairMaster, and I do weights.","So I go to my first book signing, and these two girls came up and gave me a piece of paper: '10 reasons you should date our dad. He climbed Mount Kilimanjaro. He's a lawyer.' He didn't know what was going on. He didn't even know me. They called him, and he came down and asked me out that day. Now I'm dating their dad!","Weight is just not a hot button. In fact, during my life, it probably should have been on my radar screen a bit more. I look back at work photos and am shocked. Was I eating the people I was interviewing?! Good Lord, I was big.","I don't cook, but I would love to learn.","One day, right after my mastectomy, I went for a walk in Central Park, and there was this mob of people blocking the road. I thought, 'Oh, great, now I'm stuck!' but then I suddenly realized that it was a breast cancer walk.","If it weren't for my breast cancer, I wouldn't be a 'Today' host. After I got better, I talked to my boss about working on the show. Six months before, I'd have been terrified to go in there and ask for what I wanted. But after what I'd been through, how could I be scared of being told no?","If we all helped one person, wouldn't the world be an unbelievable place?","My style is streamlined, sophisticated and simple, so I usually go for a dress. No matching involved. I am bad at matching! I like easy and when you're done, it looks like a second skin. I wear dresses every day for that reason. It's easy!","When my shoes are killing me, I take a maxi pad and put it in the bottom of my shoe. It is better than any Dr. Scholl's insert. That fashion tip has saved me through some long nights.","I love Jennifer Aniston's style. She is streamlined and never overdone. And Demi Moore always looks classic, gorgeous and sophisticated.","In New York City, you can walk down the street and see a girl in a trench who looks equally as cool as a girl wearing Lululemon. It's like you're watching models. You see a little of everything right by you.","To this day, my mom's unsinkable spirit is an inspiration to me. For nearly thirty years, she's worked at the Library of Congress. Everyone knows Sameha simply as 'Sami.' Along with 500 miles of shelved books, her closest friendships are cataloged in that library. They are as much the value of work to my mom as is the work itself.","I can't remember a time when my mom didn't work. She has forever been on the move: a go-getter. When my brother Adel and I had a paper route as kids, my mom would get up before us at the crack of dawn to drop off the Washington Post at different corners."],"Hodding Carter":["Television news is like a lightning flash. It makes a loud noise, lights up everything around it, leaves everything else in darkness and then is suddenly gone.","Within the last three years the amount of classified materials has doubled to 15.6 million decisions to classify documents."],"Holbrook Jackson":["Genius is initiative on fire.","Your library is your portrait.","Beware of your habits. The better they are the more surely they will be your undoing.","The time to read is any time: no apparatus, no appointment of time and place, is necessary. It is the only art which can be practiced at any hour of the day or night, whenever the time and inclination comes, that is your time for reading; in joy or sorrow, health or illness.","Patience has its limits, take it too far and it's cowardice.","Intuition is reason in a hurry.","No man is ever old enough to know better.","The poor are the only consistent altruists; they sell all they have and give it to the rich.","Those who seek happiness miss it, and those who discuss it, lack it.","The end of reading is not more books but more life.","Suffer fools gladly; they may be right.","A mother never realizes that her children are no longer children."],"Holland Roden":["Good skin is the best foundation for your makeup.","I'm a huge Michael J. Fox fan.","If you manifest your true self through nature and your normal surroundings, I find that the most eerie. Like when you see birds suddenly start flying in a different direction or when you see moths forming weird shapes, I think that's the weirdest way to let yourself be known.","I bought a car, but not just any car; I bought a Volvo, which was the safest on the road at the time. It's not any more, so I upgraded to the Mercedes.","In real life, I'm so brutally honest that it almost works against me sometimes.","I always feel like everything I shoot is a student project, and nobody else knows about it. I forget, in the moment, that other people will see it.","You get the information, and it's not your job to judge it or not judge it. You adapt, and you do it. That's what we do as actors. We're just as surprised as the viewers, sometimes.","As actors, sometimes we want our character to go somewhere different than it goes, but that's being an actor.","Most actresses are always running late - I'm no exception.","I'm not a big eye makeup girl unless there's a professional doing it - otherwise I look like I have two black eyes!","I just always wanted to sit in a casting session and see all of the train wrecks that come in.","One of my favorite movies is 'Back to the Future'.","Between Twitter and Facebook and how close you can be with your fans and how close they can be to you these days is, I think, quite miraculous. It's like getting a greeting card every single day."],"Holland Taylor":["I notice that most of the men who tease me about my hair, don't have any.","It's interesting, I had absolutely no maternal instinct. I'm much more interested in young people now.","I've had some marvelous parts, but I'm also asked to play characters who are kind of superficial people.","I've never written a play before, and I'll never write one again. You can quote me.","I've had a long life and a lot of relationships and not one of them do I wish - well, I take that back - there are a couple I could have done without.","I always did think I would be married and settled down by now but maybe I ain't ready.","I just never was the marrying kind.","I love playing someone who just skates by and does anything she wants.","I've often played very strong, flashy, kind of inadvertently mean women. I am not that way in my real life.","I've always had a hunger for realizing myself through my career.","It took a long time to get to the place in my career where I could pick and choose what I wanted to do."],"Holliday Grainger":["True love, especially first love, can be so tumultuous and passionate that it feels like a violent journey.","I come from a very loving, stable background where I've been persuaded to just be myself and anything is possible.","'The Borgias' is quite good because it does stick quite steadfastly to historical fact, so a lot of people who are interested in the historical element will love watching it, but they were also a ridiculously dramatic family.","It's always really surreal, being on a film set, but inside a beautiful, massive scene.","To be able to analyze plays and novels is so relevant to acting.","I'd love to do more independent films.","I seem to play a lot of troubled kids.","I did a year at Leeds, studying English. They basically threw me out, because I was taking too much time off to act. So I transferred to the Open University, because I could do it all online. By that point, I had admitted to myself that I had the acting bug.","I don't really have any strategy for my career.","I'm very lucky, as I've never ever felt any pressure from any producer to lose weight, whereas a lot of actresses have.","Long scenes of emotion are quite difficult - you've got to build up to them and make sure you're in the right emotional space.","The media was completely influential in the rise and fall of Bonnie and Clyde.","I love the opportunity to do lots of different kinds of projects - independent films and big studio epics as well. I'd love to be able to do a mixture.","Jack Thorne writes so well for messed-up teenage girls.","I auditioned for a musical, and I can't sing. It was a kid's film musical, not a stage show, so I thought I could get away with it.","I don't have any massive ambitions to be a movie star.","I'd like to continue acting as long as I enjoy it.","You'll always end up filling out a character. It might be with aspects of yourself.","When I was younger, I was always being told I had a period face, but 'Bel Ami' was my first shot at it.","As much as I'd love to be a successful actor, the thought of being recognised in the street is petrifying.","I've got a massive actor girl crush on Carey Mulligan, so I'd love to be buddies with her. She just oozes this joyful, natural innocence and always brings a nice emotional depth to her character.","I'm developing a little crush on Michael Fassbender. Really unoriginal.","I enjoy flitting around between hair colours. I find it fascinating when people think I'm naturally blonde, as I've only been blonde for about two seconds. People pay more attention to you as a blonde; it's also easier for people to assume you're a ditsy young actress. Of course, I am a ditsy young actress - well, maybe not ditsy.","I was so tiny when my parents split up that I can't remember them ever being together. That was never an issue, as I guess I never went through the trauma of them splitting up.","I admire my mother for being a single mum. It's ridiculously hard.","When you're a child, you take things for granted. For instance, my mum didn't have a lot of money, but I went to piano, ballet and gymnastics lessons, and tae kwon do."],"Hollie Cavanagh":["Music can help you through any kind of emotion. It can help you through a break-up, make you dance, or help you realize or understand something about yourself... and if I can sing a song and make someone feel those things then I will feel like I have made a difference.","I don't really unwind after a performance. I'm still pumped up and just want to get back on stage.","For me the voice is the most important, but making your singing believable makes a great performer.","I never want to pick an easy song. I want to continue to challenge myself vocally.","I would like my album to be on the pop side with a little bit of soul. I would like to make music that is on the top of the charts right now."],"Hollis Stacy":["I think people feel threatened by homosexuality. The problem isn't about gay people, the problem is about the attitude towards gay people. People think that all gays are Hannibal Lecters. But gay people are sons and daughters, politicians and doctors, American heroes and daughters of American heroes.","Coming from a big family, I learned a lot. Things don't have to be perfect. You can do okay with 'almost.'","Why do we work so hard to feel so terrible.","Have a blast while you last.","When I was a little girl in Savannah playing, there were never enough hours in the day or holes on the golf course. I just loved the game so much.","I have lived the American dream in every aspect, and now I hope to make a very big impact in helping the planet.","The LPGA is basically corporate America's dinner party, and they can invite whomever they want. They're not ready for people getting up and making declarations. The bottom line is corporate America is pretty homophobic.","I can't see anyone coming out, because the players feel it is no one's business. We all stick together. We're a very tight group. It would be too hard for just one person to do, too stressful. And why should it make a difference? The LPGA is about golf.","When I get on a course that's not very good, that's not tough, I fall asleep. Mentally I must be lazy, like a little kid, but I always seem to do well when there's a tough situation.","I was a hotshot as a junior. When I was 18, I really got into fiddling around. I completely lost interest in golf, and I guess all I could think about was going to college, getting married and having babies.","The Internet is a game changer. I'm hopeful I can make a contribution by providing a way to learn about the game of golf free of charge.","Women's golf definitely hit a bump in the road. We lost some tournaments due to a combination of things led by the downturn in the economy.","The competition I played against was fantastic, but golf is a different game now. The courses have shrunk because the equipment has gotten better. They're hitting the ball 10 to 15 percent farther because of the changes in the golf ball."],"Holly Black":["Into every generation comes a vampire.","What I've always loved about faeries is the way that they, unlike so many other supernatural creatures, are not human and have never been human. They have different customs and different taboos, and woe to anyone who breaks them.","There's never really been a time when vampires weren't so over that you would be crazy to write a vampire book, or so huge that you would be crazy to write a vampire book. I'm not sure there's ever going to be a time. We went from Anne Rice to Buffy to 'Twilight.'","'Twilight' passed like a fever through the sophisticated reader and the unsophisticated reader alike. People devoured those books in single sittings, over weekends, with a kind of raw intensity that is rare.","Inspiration comes from everywhere. From life, observing people, etc. From movies and books you love. From research.","I think there are a lot of really positive aspects to social media for novelists. Even though our work is pretty solitary, through Twitter and Tumblr and Facebook and Instagram and blogging in general, we're better able to connect directly with readers.","In the older folklore, faeries were frightening beings. In fact, it was such a bad idea to get their attention that people would use flattering euphemisms for them, such as 'the people of peace,' 'the little people,' and 'the good neighbors.'","I've loved vampires for a very long time. In eighth grade, I guess, my research paper was on vampires.","One of the great things about writing middle-grade books is that it's really a nice break, when you're writing super intense stuff like 'Coldtown', to be able to write something a little lighter - calm down and do something different.","I loved Anne Rice's 'Interview with a Vampire' and 'The Vampire Lestat'. I found a copy of 'Interview' when I was in seventh grade at a garage sale for 25 cents. It had a crazy cover.","Growing up, my mom was a painter, my best friend was a painter, my husband is a painter. For a long time I knew artists, and I didn't know any writers.","The problem with faerie gifts is that they always come with a price, which is why they are made by the desperate and the foolish.","Someday I would like to be the kind of writer who barrels through a draft, but I can't even seem to barrel through an interview like this, so I imagine I have a long way to go.","I am not very good at sticking to outlines, and I double back all the time to revisit scenes and change things.","I'm not a fast writer, and I find the process of writing a first draft to be painful and frustrating. Usually, I start with a character, a premise, and some image that gives me a particular feeling.","I revise a lot while I'm drafting, often going back to the beginning again and again to revise because I've changed massive things about the story. By the time I get to the end of a first draft, I've been through the beginning lots of times.","I think there's a reason that horror appeals to teens. There's a lot of useful lessons to take away from reading horror. We get to be scared in the comfort and safety of our own homes. We can put the book down if we get too scared, and no one will ever know if we decide not to pick it up again.","I read 'Sabella or The Blood Stone' by Tanith Lee, which was hugely influential to me. I love Tanith's writing. She's just really lyrical, beautiful use of language.","Vampires aren't made - they're just born that way, and no one knows why. They're sort of a race unto themselves.","I really love being a weirdo who writes a lot of different things for a lot of different ages. I have been considering doing a guide on my website so that a reader who liked one of my books could find the other books that he or she might like, because I know some of the books are really different from the rest.","Can you write 200 words a day? 100? 50? In six months, 50 words a day is 9,000 words. That's 2-3 short stories. If you did 200 words every day, in three months that's 36,000 words. That's half a short novel.","When we talk about good books, we often talk about good sentences, but what we rarely talk about is reader pleasure. Yet it is reader pleasure that is going to make a book break out into the kind of success that makes it into a household name.","When I was a kid in the U.S., 'Doctor Who' wasn't really on, but you would occasionally catch an episode. Different stations did marathons.","'Doctor Who' rewrites your brain because at first when you watch it, you think, 'That doesn't make sense.'","I wrote a book called 'Doll Bones', which was another middle-grade book, and when I was writing it, I needed a place in the U.S. that made bone china. And there are only two places in the U.S. that make bone china. They made it by grinding down actual cow bones. It was a plot point. It was a creepy doll book.","I really love the idea of the poetically mad - the character that is imbued with the romantic madness. Like River from 'Firefly' or Drusilla from 'Buffy.' Someone dangerously unhinged, where you're really not sure they're going to be reliable minute-to-minute.","I don't feel prolific. I feel like I'm plodding along. Each day you sit down, and you hope that you get your work done.","Everything scares me. I'm very easily frightened. But the thing that scares me most is zombies. I really, really don't like zombies.","Three hundred words in a day is not a lot. So much of it is thinking before writing. And then there's the cutting. But you do what you do and keep moving forward.","One of my favorite things in books is watching someone make the mistake. You know it's going to happen. You keep thinking: 'Don't do it!' But of course they're going to do it. It's riveting. You learn through them that it's okay. It's the ecstatic fall, where you watch someone make that terrible decision, and there's such pleasure in it.","Writers usually don't get to pick our own covers. I know it's surprising to hear that.","Faeries are associated with wild untamed nature, with art, and with death - so the folklore is rich with different stories to explore."],"Holly Branson":["Most families like to spend time bonding over meals out, picnics in the country, maybe weekend camping trips - we take things to the extreme!","Just imagine how different the world could be if we all spoke to everyone with respect and kindness.","When I brought my medical school friends home, Dad used to tell us that we didn't know anything about the world. He started giving me impromptu quizzes about history and current events. I quite liked that.","It's almost an impossible task to sum up all the things my parents have taught me over the years. Whether it was how to tie my shoelaces or encouragement in whatever career choice I wanted to pursue, they have both always been there to support me.","I have been lucky to meet some incredible people who do not possess what you would traditionally class as power, but through their charisma, passion, and strength of character, they are able to achieve things that 'richer or more powerful people' could only dream of.","From a young age, watching my father embark on daring, and often dangerous, adventures in the name of Virgin almost become the norm. I'm not saying it became any less nerve-wracking waiting for his safe return - but, over time, it encouraged a new way of thinking for myself and my brother Sam.","We learned not to let the fear of failure stop us from attempting to fulfil our dreams - whether that dream involved a change in career, attempting to set world records, or helping young people.","I don't think there will ever come a time that I can't learn from my parents, but there's something wonderful about getting to the age where you can role-reverse and share exciting and interesting things that you have learnt, too - even better when it's a shared passion.","Our parents are the most invaluable teachers we have, and no matter how alien it might seem to ask them to enter your 'work' world, you might just be surprised what comes out of it.","Opportunities come in all shapes and sizes but, more importantly, make way for us to make good decisions that have a roll-on effect for others.","The first We Day celebration I attended was in Vancouver, and it was the most incredible experience - there is nothing more invigorating than a buzzing room of young people who are excited to change the world.","I'm usually quite good at learning things, but I just don't find the business stuff that interesting, so it makes it harder to get my head around.","I don't really enjoy finance and accounting.","I think, the young people in the U.K., it's a vicious cycle of not feeling empowered to do anything within their community.","Our community system is completely broken down, and you need to build that back up again and make people feel that they can make a change in life and not just sit around playing video games or on their iPhones - that they can get out there and make a difference.","The Olympics was something amazing for the U.K. in bringing people together and giving the population hope.","We've grown up watching Dad setting and breaking records - my brother Sam was born when Dad was halfway across the Atlantic, going after a record.","I always thought when I left medicine it would just be a one-year timeout and I'd go back, but that's now turned into many more.","I'd be a really boring person to have cameras around all day.","I was really lucky because from a very young age, I wanted to be a doctor. So I kinda knew I had that goal for my whole life.","My mom is seriously down to earth.","Yes, my parents brought us up like anybody else. We didn't get any more presents than other people.","I want to make sure that when I walk down the aisle, I can see all my best friends, and I want to see their faces smiling back at me and not any random people.","Dad was always working in the living room. There was no distinction between work and life - it was the same thing.","I always knew I wanted to be a doctor. I saw a lot of my friends having a hard time figuring out what they wanted to do, so I'm glad I had a purpose and goal to focus on. I liked the discipline and the sense of structure.","The men in my family are the big criers.","I'm not a big cryer.","We'd have Mick Jagger round for tea one morning or Janet Jackson wandering in, but I wouldn't have been aware of it. I didn't have a clue who anyone was. They were just dad's friends popping in.","Financial reward is important, but it shouldn't be your end goal - you'll reach your dreams much sooner if you focus your efforts on more important things.","Spending time in different areas of a business and making time to understand how everyone fits together is incredibly beneficial.","I trained very hard to get into medicine, so I won't say I'll never go back to it.","When I was younger, I went with a friend of mine to Nairobi for 3 months and helped teach in an orphanage's school. It was a great experience and made me truly understand that giving back - by giving time, not just money - was so rewarding.","All businesses should have an element of social enterprise, and all social enterprises should not ignore the most important lessons from successful commercial businesses.","Businesses should encourage all their staff to come up with ideas, not be afraid to make suggestions, and then to act on those suggestions. There is nothing worse than going to a job every day were you feel like you are not making a difference to either the place you work or the world you live in.","I'm an Apple-mad person. The iPad is now such a big part of my life.","I like to be busy every day.","I'd be bored just going to parties and getting my picture taken."],"Holly Combs":["Before you have a baby, friends tell you 'sleep now,' and you laugh because you don't think that all those stories could be true. But they are.","Both my husband and I wanted a boy. I wasn't sure what I'd do with a daughter. What if she asked for a Barbie? I would have been like, 'Honey, we don't support Barbie because she isn't an accurate depiction of a woman's body.'","You need to be emotionally ready for a baby, and the best way to do that is to clean skeletons from your own closest. Deal with the baggage of your childhood, or you'll just pass it on to your kid.","I think letting babies cry it out is barbaric. Why would parenting stop when it's dark outside? You can't expect a baby to know that he's supposed to sleep just because we want to go to bed.","I was the product of very young parents, and they had wild ways. My mother was in a punk band. Rebelling would have been learning to play piano.","I have no interest in a guy who doesn't know the right end of a screwdriver.","Felicity Huffman is just flawless; she's above and beyond TV and movies and this Earth.","When Finley gets his vaccinations, it kills me, and you can't protect yourself from that. My heart is being ripped out with every shot. It's a deeper level of emotion that I wasn't prepared to feel, but it's completely amazing. It has opened me up both as a person and as an actress. Everything has a deeper meaning now.","Everyone gives 'Picket Fences' credit for being so willing to delve into issues that now would be no big deal. But it was then. It was ahead of its time.","At this point, I can almost never see myself saying no to a con or a 'Charmed' reunion, because it's so important to so many people I've already met personally."],"Holly Holm":["Aim high and don't sell yourself short. Know that you're capable. Understand that a lot of people battle with a lot of things - depression, body image or whatever else - so know that it's not just you. You're not alone.","A fighter can always recover, and you never know what they're going to come back with.","I can't even explain how blessed I am and how fortunate that I have such a great team that believes in me.","There's no single person on this planet that's worth more than the other. Know your worth. Be confident in yourself.","I still have a lot to learn, and I still have a lot to prove.","At the end of the day, you are in control of your own happiness. Life is going to happen whether you overthink it, overstress it or not. Just experience life and be happy along the way. You can't control everything in your life, but you can control your happiness.","It doesn't matter what odds are on paper or what's happened before. It matters what happens that moment.","I know there's a lot of emotion going into a fight, but everything in a fight - none of it comes out of an evil heart.","Fighting is a very emotionally draining sport. I don't want to waste time on drama beforehand.","I've been on the end of losing a fight, and there's a piece of my heart that has compassion towards that because I know how it feels.","I have MMA strengths, but I need to build on my weaknesses.","I started doing MMA and boxing at the same time - I always wanted to try an MMA fight to see what it was like. I had one fight, and I was hooked.","I'd see people being really successful, whether it was my teammates or big-name fighters like Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson, and I'd think, 'I want to be a legend like that.'","When I don't have a fight scheduled, training is even more fun. I can come into the gym and work on stuff that isn't generated for a specific game plan. I can just play around with it and have a good time. I never want to get to the point where I'm sick of it.","I'm always open to suggestions. I'm open to opportunities. Whether I take them or not, I don't know. And I would only take them if I weren't training, if I didn't have a fight scheduled. I really want to keep my focus on fighting. That's where all these doors are opening up from anyways. I don't want to lose sight of that. I love fighting.","When people are self-entitled for no reason, just with anything, that bothers me. It's like waiting for someone to cross the road, and they walk slower because they know you're waiting. I like all the credit due in the places that it's supposed to be due.","There's a ton of nerves for every fight I've been in; it doesn't matter if it was my debut.","There's a lot of criticism in this job and what we do. It's in front of everybody and for everybody to have their own opinion about what we do. Don't be in this position if you can't handle that criticism.","I'm glad people think that I can do well. I always say I would rather that be the scenario than on the other end of it saying, 'We thought she'd be real crappy.' I'll take the side that I'm on. I'll take that people think that I'm going to do well; they have faith in me and believe in me, and that makes me feel stronger.","I just want to be a fighter. I just like to win fights.","I'm going to hit you as hard as I can regardless of whether you touch my gloves or not.","A rematch is one of those things that will always be there when you remove a champion, and it's something you definitely need to give them - that chance for a rematch. That's the only way to do it.","I have a different kind of experience than other girls had. I've had to face a lot of different styles and adjust to them. I had to face a lot of bad situations and come back. I've had to fight with my eyes swollen shut and my nose broken and bloody.","Some people feel stronger in their 30s. I'm 34. I've noticed I do feel stronger now than when I was 24. But I'm also more sore in the mornings. If I have a bump or a bruise from practice, it takes me a little bit more than just an ice bath to get rid of it. At the end of the week, my body's ready for a day off.","I think sometimes in life we rush and only later look back and say, 'Wow, that was something pretty cool that I did,' and we realize we should have been more aware while it was happening.","There's days in training where everything flows and days in training where they don't. You just pray that doesn't happen the night of the fight.","I think you can get so mentally beat by kind of working yourself up too much."],"Holly Hunter":["Even very ordinary people, upon closer examination, can often look extraordinary.","In my real life, I see people who are really enjoying their lives - I mean, really enjoying their lives - and they take joy in their daily obligations; they just do. And I believe that at a certain point, you've got to choose to be that way. You choose to approach your life that way. Or it's all kind of a drag until Friday.","I like to do research. It gives me a sense of ownership. That's very powerful for me as an actor to just own it.","I'm not religious. I'm not an atheist. Would I say I'm an agnostic? Possibly. But I would say the collective unconscious is something I'm much more interested in.","I was born and raised on a farm, where boys had chores and girls did not, i.e., drive tractors, bale hay, take care of cattle.","I'm a practicing Catholic. And faith is very, very important to me. It was pounded in my head as a kid, and I hated it. And I sort of lost my way in my 20s and part of my 30s and then found my way back. And I don't know what I'd do without it. It's huge in my life.","Privacy is paradise.","The unknown makes people uncomfortable. And even living in a city that's as cosmopolitan as New York City is, there's so many things I don't know about other cultures, even though I encounter other cultures - maybe even 18 or 19 of them - when I get on a subway car every day.","I love to look at physically beautiful people, and obviously others do, too. But there's such a narrow definition of what that is; the people who are my friends in life, the more I get to know them over the years, the more beautiful they are to me.","Crazy people are my people? Really? I think that's silly. That's another one of those pigeonhole things. Lay somebody on an ironing board and put a scalding hot iron on them, get that going real good: 'Oh, this is who Holly Hunter is.'","It's a fantastic mirror to us to engage with art, to engage with paintings that are about tragedy, to go see Shakespearean comedies, to read a Greek play... We have always investigated the lightness and darkness of the human soul, in all these forms. So why not do it on television?","My sister took me as her own. My mum had a lot of help raising me. That's what happens in large families: your siblings raise you.","I'm a leading lady character actor; I don't fit in one slot simply. I've always been used to a certain amount of struggle, and that prepared me wonderfully for a mature age.","I grew up on a farm. The worst-looking chickens are the best layers. The ones that are the scraggliest... those are usually the ones that are really cooking.","I appreciate my instincts, but my instincts can be dead wrong. Circumspection can give you time.","This is why we have racism, really: because people are confronting the unknown, and they don't like that.","The self-help section of national bookstore chains in America is one of the largest sections. In a way, it's nothing new, and in another way, very new. People have always searched for answers; that's why we have religion. People have always been seeking some relief from their own mortality.","Once I hit 45, there was a real downturn. But I got an incredibly provocative, delicious lead role in a television series called 'Saving Grace,' and I loved the character.","I got a horror film, 'The Burning,' and suddenly I was making crazy money, like a thousand a week, so I moved into an apartment on Amsterdam with a guy who was also in 'The Burning,' Jason Alexander.","As we get older, people close down. We get less adaptive, less flexible - literally. Curiosity can diminish, and you want safety. You want what you know.","Do I believe in God? I don't know what that really means. I don't know what my personal connections with G-o-d are. But spirituality is soulfulness.","I object to the actual phrase 'Follow me.' You've gotta be kidding! Why would I want to follow anybody else? Nor do I want them to follow me. The machinations of my life, the banalities - they're mine. They belong to me.","I love wearing wigs because they're instantly transformational.","I guess I'm more of a direct person than an indirect one.","I get cold really quickly, but I don't care. I like weather. I never understand why people move someplace so that they can avoid weather.","I've never directed, but it must be humbling.","The rhythm of my career has always been very static, staccato and then silent, and then a lot of work, and then none.","I've never had a career of that kind of box office power. I've always learned the hard way.","I really admire people who are extraordinarily tolerant and patient.","I've never worked as much as I would've wanted to, and that's why I end up doing a lot of stage as well, because stage is a full course meal.","More and more movies have been pressured to allow reporters and TV cameras to come onto the set while you're working, and I find that a real violation.","I would love to work more - I really would - but there is not a lot of stuff around and the stuff that is around is not very complicated; it tends to lie a little flat.","I act probably a lot more than you see. I happen to choose movies that don't have much of a life, or I choose movies that are shown on cable instead of as features.","I think it's really odd, too, that the public is so privy to how much money the actors make and what movies cost. It seems to me to be beside the point. When I go to a movie I really don't want to think about the money. I want to see the story.","It's the same with people knowing absolutely everything there is to know about an actor. I actually think the more personal information you have about an actor, the more you have to carve out for yourself when you go to a movie and see them in it.","Mothers and daughters can stay very connected during teenage years. In the middle of your life, you can become very alone. Even though you're connected deeply to other family members, lovers, husbands, friends.","I don't offer advice to actors only because I've seen actors become successful through ways that would never even occur to me or that wouldn't work for me.","I've enjoyed the process of understanding who I am through my work and who I am in relation to others: the intense collaboration that acting requires and thrives in.","There's no way that anyone can know the ebb and flow of one's career. You can't know that. You can tell young actors it's going to be very difficult, but there's no way you can understand the difficulties and the rewards through description. You have to cellularly experience it.","I always had an acting crush on Philip Seymour Hoffman. He just wowed me all the time. He was just quietly so impressive and so private.","I am a huge fan of Cronenberg, all his movies.","Man, I would have loved to have been fully cognisant of the power of Janis Joplin. I would have loved to have been part of the revolution.","I reveal all of myself. I bring all of myself to my roles. You only see me. You don't see anything else but me. That is who's there. They're manifestations of my own self.","I never thought about moving to L.A.; I always wanted to be in New York. I moved there, and now I still have a kind of love affair with the city.","Most of the time I live a fully anonymous life, which is the way I like it.","It's considered a coup to become a lead on a kind of cutting-edge television series. I mean, that's a plus for your feature film career and for your career in general. There are no walls anymore between the two.","What's great about cable is that the ceiling of expectation is lowered because fewer people have to tune in for it to be a success. You don't need 23 million people a week like you do in broadcast.","For every movie that you go see, how many leading male roles are there in any given movie, and how many leading female roles are there? There may be 5 or 6 really good roles for guys and maybe one for a woman. And it doesn't even matter if you're 25. That's just the logistics.","My career has never really been a vertical kind of thing. I mean, it's always been a bit difficult for me.","I remember that when I was in my 30s, a hot age for an actress, lots of offers were coming in, but nothing was great, and I didn't work for 18 months. It was at a really fruitful age, and I wanted to work. There was nothing coming down the pipeline that I thought was good - and then I got 'The Piano.'","Sometimes it's very difficult to do a movie that's good and then have that movie make it to the light of day.","Sometimes I take a movie that I know is not great; it's not great on the page, but I need to work. Sometimes I need to make the money. I need dough. I want to work, and so I'll take something that is compromised in some arena. But it's like, actors gotta act.","The unknown makes people uncomfortable.","I heckled somebody at the U.S. Open once. And you know, tennis, it's not a good place for that.","I believe that there is good. I believe there is evil. Do I believe that they come from God who is watching us conduct myriad never-ending wars and looks benignly on because there's higher purpose to all of this? I don't think so.","I really would love to take a big break and not be photographed, not perform.","I think that, initially, I was most passionate about music and particularly about playing the piano. I started playing when I was nine, and I was obsessed with it, really. I wouldn't even go spend the night at a friend's unless they had a piano. But I didn't have the chops, the extraordinary talent to be able to play the piano professionally.","I found acting when I was 14, when I got cast in the chorus in a high school play, 'The Boyfriend.' In my high school, we did mainly musicals, so I just started doing nothing but musicals for years and loved it.","To me, being creative is a very fragile thing. The environment in which one can create is a very particular one, and somehow, I've always felt the need to be very protective of that.","Often, in the movie business, they need somebody who will garner box office because they need to pay for the movie. So the people who are in movies that make a lot of money are the people who most often get cast in studio pictures. In my career, I've never been a box office name.","'Saving Grace' was a full stretch-out - literally, physically, spiritually, psychologically. And I needed to take a year-and-a-half off when it was over.","Sometimes you have to marinate instead of making a quick decision. I appreciate my instincts, but my instincts can be dead wrong. Circumspection can give you time.","So much European cinema has open arms to stories carried by women in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. And America is a little behind in that.","With longevity comes, 'Nothing is going to kill me; I cannot irreparably damage my career.' Those days are over. The most I can sustain are fender benders.","People have always searched for answers. That's why we have religion; people have always been seeking some relief from their own mortality.","'Top Of The Lake' is a great story with a beginning, and a middle and an end, about darkness - it's like the heart of darkness. And everybody has got one. When I was reading it, I couldn't put it down, and I wanted to know what was going to happen next.","It's always been my way to move about a little more horizontally. My career has never been like a shooting star.","I can very much enjoy taking a year off. Whereas some people would feel crippled by that, I can feel enlarged by it. And then I also like to work nonstop, maybe for a year-and-a-half, and then take a year off.","I think Ada in 'The Piano' is the most interior character I've ever had the chance to play, either on the stage or in anything I've done for film or TV.","I don't mind at all venturing off to do a television movie if it's gonna give me something new to mess around in my mind, to turn around in.","The forcefulness of life is where vitality kind of intersects.","I love fiction, you know? I find it fascinating. So when film really does go into fictional places, that's the most exciting for me. And when the fiction is about the person rather than about the place, that's even more exciting.","I don't believe in angels, and I'm not a religious person.","What is God, and how do you believe in him - how do you not believe? It's a question the world continues to tussle with. People's beliefs get them in a lot of conflicts.","I've always had to move between a couple of years of unemployment, where offers are not provocative enough to take, and seasons where I work nonstop for a year. It's always been an erratic rhythm.","Feature films seem geared toward very large budgets, action, broad comedy. That seems to dominate all year where it used to be relegated to summer.","After 'Broadcast News,' I could have played that same part, but I didn't want to. So I didn't follow it up with a hit.","A play is a hard thing, particularly in L.A. It's less expensive than in New York, but there's also less of a commitment to people doing plays than in New York. So it's a strange battle.","I don't make decisions just on the character I'm supposed to play. Sometimes it's based on the director, sometimes it's based on the story, sometimes I need money, or sometimes I'm just starved to work.","My nucleus of friends or something protects me from the machinery that is Hollywood. I don't think I'm on the same quest that a lot of people are. I guess that could be a limitation.","What people have thought of me, of the turns that I've taken, has never really played into my decisions.","Is there a higher energy? I would say yes, even if the energy is collective. Even if it's kind of Jungian, or the whole thing is collective consciousness, that may be God as far as I'm concerned. So is there an energy that's higher than mine? Yes. But would I claim it as God? I would say no.","There were so many lead roles available when I was in my thirties. Once I hit 45, there was a real downturn. But I got an incredibly provocative, delicious lead role in a television series called 'Saving Grace,' and I loved the character.","Some actors say they don't know themselves at all, and that's why they act: because they can disappear into other people.","I'm not a classically beautiful person, but hopefully it increases my longevity as an actress that my career isn't dependent on my great, great good looks.","Helen Mirren is, I think, one of the fascinating actresses. Period. She captivates people and has tremendous power and charisma because she has never cashed in on being an exquisite beauty, even though I think she is. I can't say I'm anything like her, but I hope something similar will happen with me.","People think I disappear sporadically, but I just do projects that don't get international acclaim.","Characters never live with me in film the way they do on stage, and they have certain ramifications that movies just never have.","In many parts, I start from the outside and then it triggers things within. For 'The Piano,' I went, 'I'm going to learn these piano pieces. I'm going to learn this sign language, and I'm going to do them all day every day, five days a week.' It was a totally physical thing.","As an actor, I always like some tension, some distance, between me and the character I'm playing.","I like the South: Southern literature and that relationship between grotesqueness and living below the Mason-Dixon line. But I also understand that people view it as a limitation - as an actor and as a person - perceptions that are really wrong: that you are ignorant and possibly illiterate, or that it's cute.","People don't come to New York out of resignation. They come here with a dream. Mine was to be an actress.","If you've had intimacy in your life, you can be intimate onscreen. I mean, come on - I didn't know how to hold a gun, but I could play a cop.","The whole idea of death is something that we tend to kind of really not deal with at all.","There's a tremendous amount of humor... in very unexpected places.","I've worked with a lot of female directors over the course of my career: Martha Coolidge, Catherine Hardwicke, Jodie Foster.","I don't offer advice to actors only because I've seen actors become successful through ways that would never even occur to me or that wouldn't work for me. But this has worked for me: Never memorizing a scene.","I liked to carry the script into an audition because, for me, it reminded people that this was not the final performance. I'm still a work in progress.","You can tell young actors it's going to be very difficult, but there's no way you can understand the difficulties and the rewards through description. You have to cellularly experience it. It's a very difficult career in the long run, but at the same time, there's no long-haul career I'd rather be involved with.","Minibars are very appealing, especially when someone else is paying.","I bring all of myself to my roles. You only see me. You don't see anything else but me. That is who's there. They're manifestations of my own self.","There was a drama club in our high school, and I just did plays.","I'm not a media personality, I'm an actress. I want to protect that thing: the suspension of disbelief. The rest of it is just distraction.","In the life of a director - these days in particular - when it really does take so long to do a movie, with a few exceptions, actors may never work with a director again, even if they're great friends."],"Holly Johnson":["This hype word bothers me though It always sounds like an accusation, what does it mean, advertising, column inches in the press? Bands themselves are never really responsible for all of that. That is something that happens to you when you sell millions of records.","We have such a high drop-out rate from musicians, said the head of the college. He was right - I dropped out before I even dropped in. Months later they were still asking what had happened to me, not realising that I was on a UK tour.","Although we were The Spice Girls of 1984 in Europe, My work has never been widely promoted in the U.S.","I always saw being in a band a full time job.","I always saw myself as a multi media artist.","I am financing the recording myself. So I have no big names to drop.","I wanted to make the kind of records that I heard in the discos that I danced in at that time. Funky, electronic sounds, while the musicians in the band were more rock oriented. This I suppose created the sound we know as Frankie Goes To Hollywood.","Let's face it I am not Joan Collins or Boy George.","One U.S. hit single and a hit T Shirt in 1985 does not a celebrity make.","What can I tell you? I continue to be creative, but have only been commercially successful outside of the U.S.","Writing is a creatively rewarding occupation but for me very time consuming.","I think it's been the topic of conversation for every one... If the U.S. is hit again, how are we going to handle it? Our troops are all over the place.","To see a player dunk in women's college basketball is just amazing. It's great to see that the game has reached that level now."],"Holly Lisle":["I earned my writing stripes with a large man's shoebox overflowing with rejection slips... more than 100 before I got my first, 'Yes, we want this,' accompanied by a check.","I always wrote, you know, but it was just this thing I did; what I intended was to become a terribly famous artist, perhaps with a stopover as a singer.","Writing, for all that it's harder than nursing ever was, is also more joyous and more fun and a lot less dangerous. And the major themes of my life have become the major themes of my writing, too - so it has all worked out pretty well.","I started writing with intent to publish on January 1st, 1985, when, as my New Year's resolution, I resolved to finish a book before I turned 25. It's one of only a few New Year's resolutions I remember keeping - I finished that one with a couple weeks to spare.","Don't talk about writing. Write. Don't show unfinished work to anyone. Don't show finished work to non-writers. Get your opinions, not from friends and family, but by sending your work out to editors. An endless stream of rejection slips means you need to learn more. So learn more.","Writing is a puzzle you'll spend your lifetime unlocking. You will never know it all; you will never know enough. You can always be better, and figuring out how to be better is part of the thrill and joy of the job."],"Holly Madison":["I'd rather be overweight and curvy than super thin with no curves. I'm proud of my body.","I like food too much to go on some crazy diet. French fries are my favorite downfall.","Truthfully, being pregnant is changing me as a person. Each day is part of this amazing journey that has completely shifted the focus of my life and made me reevaluate my personal and professional goals.","I would love to meet my soul mate. I'm always kind of keeping my eyes open for somebody.","Growing up in Alaska, they don't really teach you to swim there. I learned to swim just a few summers ago with Olympic gold medalist Amanda Beard. She did great, and right after that I went to get scuba certified. I had fun with it. I didn't really get scared, but some people thought that was a risk.","You don't have to just shop in the maternity section when you are pregnant - you can shop anywhere, just be shape and size savvy!","I could live a normal life. My motivation is only to take on new challenges.","I'm a curvy girl and that will never change.","I don't want to be too strict, because I think kids can get rebellious, but I want to raise my daughter to be passionate about doing good things and pursuing real things and hobbies instead of frivolous materialistic stuff.","I'm happy single, but I'm happy in both cases. I feel like I definitely thrive more as a human and I'm more successful when I'm single.","Aside from performing in 'Peepshow,' I do yoga once a week and I like Pilates. I'm more into toning exercises over aerobics. I like working with a trainer at a private gym, but I also like going with friends because you don't get bored or distracted.","I don't know why this is, maybe because I am 33 or what, but I didn't think it would be that easy for me to get pregnant. But it was.","I've always wanted to be a mom.","I don't get jealous of other girls, because I was... raised in a cloning lab to be the perfect woman for Hugh M. Hefner, so, other than the fact that my I.Q.'s probably a little higher than he would like, I have nothing to worry about.","I have cellulite - and had it even when I was at my absolute thinnest. I'm never not going to have cellulite. People need to just accept that it's there and maybe dress accordingly or use body makeup to cope with it.","I always wanted to be ambidextrous, ever since I was a little girl. I wanted to be able to use both hands, and I still use my left hand a lot.","I want six kids. We'll see how it goes, but I want a big family.","My main motivation for staying in the spotlight at all is, I don't want to just be known for being involved in 'Playboy,' or having been Hugh Hefner's girlfriend - I hate that. I like to show I can do other things and take on other challenges. That's my main motivation.","After becoming pregnant, I had to makeover my pantry just a little to make the proper adjustments to support the baby. I've found some staples that will stick around after the baby is here, too.","I moved on from the whole 'Playboy' thing five years ago and really never looked back. I'm not one of those girls who goes back to all the parties and things.","I want my daughter to be proud of me and look up to me. I think early on in my pregnancy I realized that to be the mom I want to be, I had to change my life, and that's what I'm doing.","I want to work on projects that I feel passionate about and do things that are fun and challenging. I would love to do a live musical. I'm not interested in doing the same thing over and over or the fame and exposure that comes with it. When people keep doing that, they just end up doing the same dumb stuff again and again.","You know, 'Peepshow,' in retrospect that seems like a good fit for me, but in the beginning, I'm sure you remember, nobody was sure if the show was going to last. Everybody was like, 'What are you doing? You can't sing, and you can't dance. What are you doing in this show?'","Once I decide I want to do something, I just work really hard and I do it, and I just know it's going to work. I think really positively.","I love performing in Las Vegas.","In L.A., I don't really want to go out because traffic sucks so bad. I'm sorry, I'm not going to spend five hours a day in my car, so you have to choose where you live very carefully.","Having a child on the way changes your perspective. You want to do things that will make them proud of you.","I'm thrilled to start my family with a little girl! My boyfriend and I couldn't be happier!","I was always obsessed with being famous. I had Marilyn Monroe paper dolls as a child, and I was always obsessed with her. I've just been really driven in that direction, and none of my friends were. So, I don't know what put that bug in me at a young age.","I want to get into producing. I really learned a lot from 'Girls Next Door.' Kevin Burns is a great producer. He's really talented, and he taught me a lot. I'm just looking forward to spreading the wings a little bit. Five seasons on 'Girls Next Door' was great, but it gets a little repetitive.","I was the Playmate editor for 'Playboy' for two years. I produced two years' worth of centerfolds. I did everything on that, from picking the girls to designing the sets to picking the wardrobe, coming up with themes, assigning the photographer, down to editing the photos and approving the retouching.","I'd rather go naked than wear fur.","I am a bookworm.","I wish ghosts were real!","I've had two romances since moving to Las Vegas. One was with somebody 12 years older than me, and the other was the same age, and neither worked out. I know people still think of me as one of Hugh Hefner's girlfriends, and he of course was much older than me, but that was a whole different lifestyle and a different kind of dating.","The last couple relationships I had were long distance. It's not like I can make much of an effort to travel and see anybody. The guy had to do all the work, unfortunately.","I work hard and I don't come from a rich family.","I'm not entirely sure what my end goal is, but I'd love to get involved in city politics and broadcast TV.","Like, if you look at Heidi Montag, who got 10 surgeries she didn't need, I think that's unfortunate. I've always been voluptuous with a big butt, but didn't have boobs, so I wanted my body balanced out. My nose was fine in real life, but it didn't photograph well, so I had it tweaked for my line of work. I'm very happy with it.","I started a trial period a couple of weeks ago as a correspondent for 'Extra,' and now it's become full time.","I shoot for 'Extra' three times a week, and that's great for Las Vegas, too. In addition to interviewing stars who are here for shows, parties and premieres, I'll also get peoples' reactions to different news items and topical gossip.","Since I've been pregnant, I've lost my taste for fast food. I used to be the biggest McDonald's junkie and now I don't like it anymore. I used to be the biggest fast-food connoisseur, and now I've really lost my taste for it.","But when you have a baby inside you, you're like 'Whoa!' Anything can happen here, I've got to give this baby all the nutrients it needs and really take care of myself, so this is definitely the healthiest I've ever been in my life.","I love chicken fingers, I love French fries. I love desserts. I'm not just into dessert or just into savoury food. I love it all. I'm a pig. I love food. So it takes a lot of discipline to eat healthy.","If I could have a Barbie body, which has no cellulite, I totally would. I would like to have a flatter stomach, but that won't happen either. That is never going to happen. No matter how much weight I lose, my stomach, below the belly button, always pooches out.","I think someone like Carmen Electra would be great in 'Peepshow.' Really, though, I think anyone who can sing and dance would be great.","I've started the adoption process... I really want to be a mommy."],"Holly Marie Combs":["I'm definitely a sushi person. I know I can eat a lot and still be fairly healthy.","The WB never treated us well, so we didn't expect a lot of farewell wishes and flowers or cards.","Orca family members belong together at home in the ocean, not isolated in tiny tanks at SeaWorld. If you believe that a mother should never have to know the pain of having her child torn away from her, boycott SeaWorld.","At this point, I can almost never see myself saying no to a con or a 'Charmed' reunion because it's so important to so many people I've already met personally.","A lot of my snacks are healthy. I love things like hummus, carrots, and celery, but I will never give up potato chips.","To travel America and see everything it has to offer, with my best friend, sounds like the perfect road trip.","Your faith in yourself is all you will ever have. Don't let anyone take it away from you, ever.","My mother's very proud of the name she gave me. She thought it sounded rhythmically better. It doesn't really make a difference to me what people call me, but since my mother calls me Holly Marie when she's angry, I prefer just my first name.","There are tons of people I'd like to freeze for all of eternity, but we won't go into that!","To stop smoking was actually really easy because I had already started to cut down. My husband is asthmatic, and he just can't for the life of him imagine why anybody would put smoke in their mouth, so he really helped me to start cutting down.","I had a few fibroids removed, and they left me with a Grand Canyon of scar tissue in my uterus. The doctors weren't sure I'd be able to reproduce. I was prepared for a rough road, and then out of nowhere we conceived.","I printed a list of Irish names from the Internet and my husband, Dave, saw Finley on the list. I really liked it but didn't want to scare Dave off with my enthusiasm. So I used a little reverse psychology and let him think it was his idea.","In between my first and second child, Pilates helped my body a lot.","I was a vegetarian through many of my teen years and easily revert back to that occasionally, but my immune system is usually happier with a bit of real meat.","Beets just aren't my thing. I can't get into them.","TV's a wonderful medium: this intimate way of observing how a successful family operates and deals with each other.","Everyone wants to be a writer, director, producer. I don't have the imagination for that, but, hopefully, I can continue to act.","In this industry there's this ridiculous connotation with women shows that's it's got to be difficult, and it's not true.","Before you have a baby, friends tell you, 'Sleep now,' and you laugh because you don't think that all those stories could be true. But they are.","I was worried - I wasn't sure I had the maternal instinct. But the minute my son came out, he was my favorite person on earth. I was crazily in tune with him, and I knew we were going to be fine.","I think letting babies cry it out is barbaric. Why would parenting stop when it's dark outside? You can't expect a baby to know that he's supposed to sleep just because we want to go to bed.","You need to be emotionally ready for a baby, and the best way to do that is to clean skeletons from your own closest. Deal with the baggage of your childhood, or you'll just pass it on to your kid.","It's funny, because even though on a drama like 'Picket Fences' those long monologues would stress me out, doing special effects where there's a green screen and there's nobody there to to react to and you have to recite all this dialogue, it's so much more difficult.","Everyone gives 'Picket Fences' credit for being so willing to delve into issues that now would be no big deal. But it was then. It was ahead of it's time.","You never feel like you're 100 percent at either one. I don't ever feel like I'm the best actress I can be or the best mother I can be.","My husband is very supportive - he wants me to work but understands I also want to be with the kids.","Personally, I have nothing to fall back on, and that creates a weird ambition that you have to be good at acting because you can't be good at anything else. I wish I had gone for my degree - that acting wasn't this be-all-and-end-all.","Life as an only child can be a bit lonely, and when I had Finley, I decided that if I could give him a big family, I wanted to as much as possible.","Growing up in any sort of spotlight is difficult. Everything is magnified."],"Holly Near":["If you have the guts to keep making mistakes, your wisdom and intelligence leap forward with huge momentum.","The war on drugs is a war against the communities.","Why do we kill people who are killing people to show that killing people is wrong?","My creativity and my political work are linked. I don't do this work out of guilt or out of responsibility.","I like this life. I like it when it's hard, and I like it better when it's not, but I know you don't get the sweet part without the bitter.","White middle- and upper-class men have a longer journey to go than many people.","Part of being an artist is being willing to be shocked, being willing to be surprised, being willing to be hurt.","To be always in a state of wonder is a kind of sensitivity that can sometimes be an extraordinary blessing and sometimes a real pain.","People love to hear the mistakes you've made.","When an audience comes to one of my concerts, I hope they'll see themselves, somewhere, in one of the songs.","I'm not allowing my perspective to be dictated by the dominant culture.","My parents encouraged thought. You'll get through life better if you learn how to think.","You just keep feeding hogwash to people, and pretty soon they'll eat it.","It is essential that men start being interested in and excited by how women think.","We who are interested in relative truth have to keep digging for it and not let ourselves be sucked under.","Language is like songs, like food, like dance-it is the expression of what we think.","You can't just leave out one part; the bread won't rise if the yeast isn't there.","The women's movement completely changed attitudes all over the world in ways we'll never be able to count.","A lot of artists say, I'm not political. People are afraid of this word.","When we make mistakes, say, I'm blessed that I have an opportunity to learn from this.","Leaping away from my mistakes has propelled me forward. It has great force behind it. It makes for great storytelling.","To come to a concert and hear a lot of songs from a female perspective should not make men say, 'Oh well, that's for women'.","If I didn't think and feel the way I think and feel, I couldn't sing the way I sing. And I like singing the way I sing.","When the students were killed at Kent State, the cast voted to do a demonstration from the stage, and I abstained.","Once women are not excluded, I don't think any of us will give a damn what pronouns are used. That wasn't the point.","My parents had been involved in the labor movement; if we'd grown up in the city, we would have been red-diaper babies.","To my great surprise and pleasure, I have had dinner with most of the people living with whom I would like to have dinner.","I don't believe in nirvana. If nirvana was handed to us on a silver platter, this would be the first day of our struggle to keep it.","Music can be used against us as much as it can be used for us. Muzak can put a whole nation to sleep, whereas a lullaby is intended to put a child to sleep in a sweet way.","Part of keeping space open is not to try to choose a form - to spend more time thinking about content, and let form take care of itself.","It's been important to me to be a good activist, a good thinker, a good musician, a good singer, and a good entertainer. You can't do it all, but I have walked those delicate lines as best I know how."],"Holly Robinson Peete":["As a mom, you worry about protecting your kid. But there are extra added layers of fears when you're talking about a kid with autism or who has some special needs issue.","Being a typical teenager isn't easy. When you have autism, it can be extra difficult. We need more public awareness about these hurdles as well as compassion towards these young people.","I loved football even before I married a quarterback; it's not for every woman, but I like it.","I'm a football fan in general. I'm always pulling for a good game.","I'm not a doctor or scientist. I'm just a mom. But I do think there's a genetic predisposition, and there are environmental triggers. I feel like that combination, in my child's case, is what resulted in autism."],"Holly Valance":["I never kill insects. If I see ants or spiders in the room, I pick them up and take them outside. Karma is everything.","I've got such a disgusting, wide, smug grin on my face all the time that my friends just want to slap me. I've never been so happy.","The Neighbours cast is like a second family.","I'll just be sitting down having dinner with girlfriends or something and people come up and ruin the dinner.","I just want to do something risque for my debut, purely because I didn't want to make an entrance being the pretty, sweet type that I've been seen as for the last 3 years.","I don't want to be 35 years old and still popping out songs in miniskirts and la-la-la.","Whether you've done anything wrong or not people will write whatever they want, so it's just a matter of not reading it, not buying into it, and hopefully the people that do read it realise that it's just fictional stories for entertainment.","I'm dying to get back in front of the cameras. I miss it like crazy.","Well the press and things like that are pretty hard core, but I don't pay too much attention to that.","Money was tight and Mum used to do two jobs to support us.","I never felt hard done by and never wanted for anything, but I grew up in a wealthy area where I saw people being handed things on a plate. So it made me want to earn some money and be able to buy things for myself.","When I was younger, things got to me more, but not now."],"Holt McCallany":["I love boxing. I really respect the guys and admire the guys who do it. But, I'm very, very happy with my career as an actor. I made the right choice and things are really working out for me right now, but I won't pretend that there isn't a part of me that always secretly wanted to be a boxer.","I love boxing, and boxing has always been my favorite sport. I was always into it, and I boxed recreationally all of my life.","I always wanted to play a boxer because some of my favorite films, as a boy, were those great boxing movies, like 'Raging Bull', 'Rocky', 'The Set Up', 'Fat City and Hard Times'. I just loved those films.","I had been in the gym training for many, many years, but I definitely stepped it up when it was time to get into shape to play 'Lights'. I began trying to live the life of a boxer, and that means everything that you would expect.","I love the whole world of boxing and the sense of community that exists there.","I take my hat off to my friend, Mark Wahlberg, because I know that it took him a long time to make 'The Fighter', and he overcame a lot of obstacles to do it, and now the film is an unqualified success.","The greatest gift that an actor can have is good scripts because then you're relieved of the responsibility of trying to elevate the material.","I would say that one of the really special gifts about playing an athlete is that it's the best motivation you'll ever have to get in top shape and stay in top shape because you know that you're going to be expected to deliver.","Not all television scripts are created equal. And the process is ridiculous. They send you a script and want you in the next morning. That's not how acting works. You can do anything to me as an actor; I'm a very resilient guy. Just don't rush me. If you ask me to do it immediately with no time to prepare, I know you have contempt for actors.","I've always believed my success in the entertainment business is an inevitability. You have to believe that; you have to be an optimist.","You've got to wake up every morning and believe, 'I was born to do this.'","I've done a lot of fight scenes, and I always find that it's better that they be meticulously choreographed. You want them to look as real as possible, but you don't want anyone to get hurt. So I believe in really working it out in rehearsal, and when you get to the set, just go for it 100 percent.","When I do a movie, I have the script. I know how it begins and how it ends. I know what my character does and where he's going. If I have ideas I want to express or changes I want to make, there's one guy: the director. It's different in television."],"Homaro Cantu":["The significance of the cherry blossom tree in Japanese culture goes back hundreds of years. In their country, the cherry blossom represents the fragility and the beauty of life. It's a reminder that life is almost overwhelmingly beautiful but that it is also tragically short.","Most of us have fond memories of food from our childhood. Whether it was our mom's homemade lasagna or a memorable chocolate birthday cake, food has a way of transporting us back to the past.","The cherry blossom tree is truly a sight to behold, especially when it is in full riotous bloom. There are several varieties of the cherry blossom tree, and while most of them produce flowering branches full of small pinkish-hued flowers, some of them produce actual cherries.","Cooking classes are a great way to hone your skills, learn new recipes, and meet like-minded friends. Spending time in the kitchen with people who love to cook as much as you do is fun and educational.","You know, I want to eat junk food. My kids love junk food.","If you could eat portions of pine trees, you could eliminate corn in many ways.","Every month, about 20 tons of paper are wasted in restaurant menus alone, and so, you know, by that rationale, if you just ate your menu that was made from organic, local products, you could eliminate that paper waste.","I was bored at school and bored in a lot of the kitchens. It seemed like all I was doing was putting things into saute pans.","From food trucks to hot dog stands to county fair favorites, 'street food' has enjoyed a rich and storied history in American cuisine. However, street food has been around for thousands of years. In fact, street food is believed to have originated as far back as Ancient Rome.","When we think of classic American desserts, we tend to imagine apple pie and ice cream. However, the most classic American dessert of all might be the chocolate chip cookie.","In time, foods such as hamburgers and ice cream became more than just meals. They became part of American history and culture, touchstones that are almost immediately nostalgic and sentimental no matter how old you are or what part of the country you are from.","The world is full of challenges, but with those come opportunity, and I'm an opportunist.","According to the supermarkets, there is no such thing as 'out of season.' Berries in the middle of February? Why not? Seafood flown in from Japan? Sure. While it all adds up to appetizing and varied meals throughout the year, regardless of the weather, it comes with a price tag - both ethical and financial.","I am a firm believer that if you can explain it to a kid, you're on the right track.","Whether you are new to the scene or a long-time grillmaster, everyone has unique preferences when it comes to their cooking method of choice. From propane to charcoal to wood, people take their method of grilling quite seriously, and some argue quite passionately about the pros and cons of each method.","A food's value is based on how good it tastes.","With a little more tweaking, we could make orange juice in the orange without any packaging or processing.","The only projects that excite me have to be tied to some aspect of social change. No matter how beautiful, a coffee book doesn't exactly move you to change the way you cook or eat.","Gastronomy has to catch up to the evolution in technology.","The cow, basically, eats three basic things in their feed: corn, beets, and barley, and so what I do is I actually challenge my staff with these crazy, wild ideas. Can we take what the cow eats, remove the cow, and then make some hamburgers out of that?","Sitting down and sharing a meal together combines two of my favorite loves: eating great food and talking about great food.","If you have time-release pills, you could have time-release expanding cheesecakes.","If you look at, you know, the limitations of creating new products, you're only limited by the technology that you have to work with.","We could eliminate sugar across the board for all confectionary products and sodas, and we can replace it with all-natural fresh fruit.","There's just a certain fear that people have when they put meat coming out of a printer in their mouth.","I was just taught very early that if I didn't solve problems, I was headed for a very dark path. Problems were everywhere. Now, even if there are no problems, I look for problems. I'm like, 'You know what? I don't like the way this spoon works. I want to design a new spoon.'","I can't think of a time in the history of man when food was in excess. We're dealing with the same old problems we've dealt with for 60,000 years.","Algae is the perfect food plant. It doubles cell mass every twelve hours, depending on the strain.","The Japanese have a long lifespan in part because they eat different forms of algae.","We can create any sort of flavor on a printed image that we set our minds to.","From a very young age, I liked to take apart things. All of my Christmas gifts would wind up in a million pieces. I actually recall taking apart my dad's lawnmower three times to understand how combustible engines work.","A molecular gastronomist is really just someone who explores the world of science and food.","My wife and I are always concerned about how long it's going to take to eat out. You just don't know.","All of the plants that we do not consider food that are safe for the human body to digest, we don't eat because they're sour and bitter. The reason why you don't eat Kentucky bluegrass or crabgrass is because it tastes sour and bitter.","The interesting thing about the miracle berry in chemo patients is that it actually straightens out their taste buds, whereas for you and I, it blocks our bitter and sour receptors. For them, it straightens them out to taste food as it normally tastes.","My goal is to spread ideas. Trends always start at the top.","Any idea's a great idea as long as it tastes great.","What is cooking? 'Cooking' is a loose term. It's understanding energy or the lack thereof.","Lots of the cooking classes open to non-professionals are too low-level for experienced foodies, or don't offer enough hands-on training.","Previous generations used to eat locally out of necessity. Without options like flash-freezing and worldwide export services, communities had to rely on local farms for all of their meals. In many ways, this was beneficial. People ate fresh, seasonal foods that were naturally flavorful and nutritious, and farmers and communities prospered.","Most Americans live on a diet that includes processed fare that is neither fresh nor natural.","Urban farming is not only possible, it is crucial. But it can't be like the farming techniques of yore.","Almond Joys are a childhood favorite, but most of us could do without all those grams of sugar, especially when trying to instill healthy habits in our kids.","I love a great conspiracy story. Who doesn't?","Nobody likes it when someone calls in sick.","People often think that losing your job is one of the worst things that can happen to someone. And, in some cases, that might be true. But for me, unemployment can be the time and the motivation to finally go after my goals.","Things that are ultimately complex must have a simple end user experience if they are to be successful.","Food trucks give creative entrepreneurs the ability to cook with freedom and make what they love, meaning that they can create highly specialized meals without having the high overhead costs of running a restaurant.","Unlike charcoal grills, which take up to 30 minutes or more to heat up, wood pellet grills can give off an even heat quite quickly. And, unlike propane grills which heat up quickly but lack flavor, foods cooked on pellet grills are rich in smokiness and succulence.","Wood pellet grilling could potentially have a lower risk of cancer when compared to other forms of grilling, as some people say that it leads to the creation of fewer carcinogens.","Sweet treats are as much a part of our culture as they are our taste palettes, and it can sometimes seem as though sugary snacks are everywhere."],"Home Run Baker":["It's better to get a rosebud while you're alive than a whole bouquet after you're dead.","The farmer doesn't care for the pitchers' battle that resolves itself into a checkers game. The farmer loves the dramatic, and slugging is more dramatic than even the cleverest pitching.","I hope I never do anything to hurt baseball."],"Homer Hickam":["To be a great nation and a great people, you have to do great things.","Remember, it isn't the dreamers who have good lives - it's the doers. Remember also what I call the three Ps of success: passion, planning, and perseverance.","I have always found the best way to live is to be optimistic and energetic and willing to work hard for my dreams as well as the dreams of others.","Tired of burning fossil fuel and polluting the planet? The moon is covered with helium 3, an isotope from the sun that is the perfect fuel for clean fusion reactors.","A memoir is not an autobiography. It's a true story told as a novel, using techniques of novelization. The author is allowed to compress events, combine characters, change names, change the sequence of events, just as if he's writing a novel. But it's got to be true.","Persevere with a plan to reach your passion, and life will be good.","NASA's charter is to give Americans the means to get into the wild, black yonder, beyond even the grasp of the federal government that funded it.","The mining towns I describe in the 'Helium-3' novel series are not unlike Coalwood, but there is one major difference: Those towns, rather than being located in the Appalachian coalfields, are on the moon.","Glenn's 1962 Mercury flight was fraught with dramatics, from his 'Zero G and I feel fine!' exultation upon entering orbit to his reentry with what was feared was a faulty heat shield. After he safely splashed down, the nation erupted with applause and gratitude not seen since Charles Lindbergh's solo flight across the Atlantic.","Interestingly, 'October Sky' is an anagram of 'Rocket Boys', the same letters just moved around. This was discovered by director Joe Johnston using an anagram program on his computer.","Rational thought will always trump medieval dogma.","After I'd gotten a year under my belt in college, I thought I'd outgrown my home.","After marketing surveys by Universal Studios indicated that 'Rocket Boys' as a movie title would not attract the female over-age-thirty demographic, the film was retitled and released as 'October Sky.'","My father lost an eye to a snapped cable while trying to rescue trapped miners, though he kept on working for fifteen years afterward.","When I began to write my books about Coalwood, I was surprised to discover, upon reflection, that it wasn't an ordinary place at all.","My father use to say if coal died, the country died. He was right. Our economy rests on the back of the coal miner. If we did not have the black diamonds of the mountains to burn, we would lose more than half of the nation's energy reserves.","When I was a boy, one of my favorite places to go was a pine-filled hollow high on the mountain behind our house. It was a place where the industrial song of Coalwood subsided. I would sit on a dead log and listen to nothing except the beating of my own heart and the thoughts racing through my head.","One thing we've learned about space is that the human body starts to fall apart after relatively short exposures to microgravity.","I've seen the government up close and personal, and for the most part, it's inefficient and hidebound, and it stifles creativity in any industry it clutches within its well-meaning but slimy tentacles.","Boeing, LockMart, and hundreds of other companies, large and small, work in the space business, and they also create new techniques and technology; but they'd be nowhere if NASA and the Department of Defense hadn't shown the way by funding the first big rockets and satellites.","Rather than being an impediment, NASA can and should be the driver of commerce, the provider of the technology necessary to make some big money in space. The truth is that private enterprise already has a huge presence up there.","What kind of country just recycles its old money, reminisces about what used to be, and doesn't know how to weld, to machine, to cast or to bolt things together? Not one that's on a path to future greatness, that's for certain.","I want to make the conquest of the moon the United States' goal for the 21st century and, through that goal, to make us a great and good and happy country for generations to come.","For a country like ours that needs to stay ahead of the world or go under, we must do great, ambitious things - like going to the moon - to survive.","Personally, I've got bigger hopes for NASA. I will stipulate it should keep putting telescopes in space so we can figure out where we fit in the universe, and it should also keep building those little robots that can and do.","Throughout my childhood, when I raised my blanket in the morning, I saw a black, sparkling powder float off it. My socks were always black with coal dirt when I took off my shoes at night.","All my life, everything important that had ever happened had always happened somewhere else. But Sputnik was right there in front of my eyes in my backyard... I felt that if I stretched out enough, I could touch it.","Coalwood, West Virginia, is the little coal-mining town where I grew up, and it was there that five other teenage boys and I famously built and launched rockets. I recounted this story in my memoir, 'Rocket Boys.'","When the moon was first visited in 1969, the astronauts brought back a treasure trove of unique minerals. Contained within specimens was an isotope called Helium-3, which turns out to be the perfect fuel for fusion reactors.","Of all the federal agencies created by Congress, one of the true success stories is the 'Mine Safety and Health Administration', which grew out of a bipartisan effort in 1977.","I grew up listening to my dad, a miner who rose through the ranks to be the mine superintendent in Coalwood, W.V. , yelling orders into his black company phone. He wanted to get coal out of the ground and into coal cars and on its way to steel mills.","When legislators do something that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, there's always the suspicion that they're in somebody's pocket.","If politicians want to save money, that's fine. They can look for all the wasteful spending they want, but not where the lives of miners are involved.","The time frame is summer 1961, a year after the gold medal in the National Science Fair. I always saw my 'Coalwood' books as a trilogy. This book finishes the story of my life in Coalwood. I think it's the best of the three.","I always give a little talk before I sign books and ask for questions. I love the Q&A sessions. We have a lot of fun at my book signings. I make sure of that!","I have the best fans of any author in the country and they deserve the best from me, too!","When I was a West Virginia lad of 17, I met a Massachusetts lad of 42 by the name of John F. Kennedy. At the time, I was in a bright orange suit that I had just purchased to wear to the 1960 National Science Fair, where I hoped my home-built rockets would win a medal. Kennedy was in West Virginia trying to win the state's presidential primary.","Until I began to build and launch rockets, I didn't know my hometown was at war with itself over its children and that my parents were locked in a kind of bloodless combat over how my brother and I would live our lives.","I ate supper after Dad saw the evening shift down the shaft, and I went to sleep to the ringing of a hammer on steel and the dry hiss of an arc welder at the little tipple machine shop during the hoot-owl shift.","'Rocket Boys,' for one reason or the other, just happened to strike a chord across country and across world, maybe because it's set in a little coal-mining town. That's why NASA likes it - most of the engineers come from towns very similar.","My dad was a miner, but he was very much an intellectual. He loved to read.","The best way to learn to write is to read in the genre you might be interested in; then, you need to actually sit down and write. In a lot of cases, the first book you write will not get published. Do not get hung up on that. Start a second book."],"Homer":["A sympathetic friend can be quite as dear as a brother.","Yet, taught by time, my heart has learned to glow for other's good, and melt at other's woe.","Wise to resolve, and patient to perform.","There is nothing nobler or more admirable than when two people who see eye to eye keep house as man and wife, confounding their enemies and delighting their friends.","Hateful to me as are the gates of hell, Is he who, hiding one thing in his heart, Utters another.","Without a sign, his sword the brave man draws, and asks no omen, but his country's cause.","There is a time for many words, and there is also a time for sleep.","Words empty as the wind are best left unsaid.","The charity that is a trifle to us can be precious to others.","And what he greatly thought, he nobly dared.","Be still my heart; thou hast known worse than this.","To have a great man for an intimate friend seems pleasant to those who have never tried it; those who have, fear it.","For rarely are sons similar to their fathers: most are worse, and a few are better than their fathers.","True friends appear less moved than counterfeit.","Hunger is insolent, and will be fed.","Nothing shall I, while sane, compare with a friend.","But curb thou the high spirit in thy breast, for gentle ways are best, and keep aloof from sharp contentions.","The difficulty is not so great to die for a friend, as to find a friend worth dying for.","Hateful to me as the gates of Hades is that man who hides one thing in his heart and speaks another.","Light is the task where many share the toil.","Two urns on Jove's high throne have ever stood, the source of evil one, and one of good; from thence the cup of mortal man he fills, blessings to these, to those distributes ills; to most he mingles both.","In youth and beauty, wisdom is but rare!","How vain, without the merit, is the name.","A decent boldness ever meets with friends.","It is not good to have a rule of many.","Even were sleep is concerned, too much is a bad thing.","Two friends, two bodies with one soul inspired."],"Honeysuckle Weeks":["Of course, it's wonderful to film any period piece - but especially 'Foyle's War' because the art direction is so imaginative and yet at the same time so real. You can open a drawer on set, and even though the camera never sees what's inside, it'll be filled with genuine 1940s documents.","The coral that grows at the edge of the reef is always the strongest and most colourful because it faces the greatest battering. It's the same if you're called Honeysuckle. I'd have had a totally different life if I'd been called Mary.","I tried doing yoga, but I have dislocating shoulders, one of which has been pinned, so I find things such as yoga and pilates, where you have to stretch quite high up with your arms and things, quite difficult.","London is not a healthy place. I feel much healthier when I'm living in the countryside or, indeed, anywhere out of London. When I go back to the countryside to visit my mother, I get out of the car, and suddenly there's great wafts of fresh air.","My parents wanted to be actors. They tried for years but didn't get anywhere. Then Mum got pregnant with me and they decided to make actors out of their children. You need your parents' support if you're going to do it. Otherwise who's going to ferry you to castings?","I loved the energy of Dublin and the fact that it's so close to the sea, with beauty spots such as Howth so close to hand.","I think to be a good actor you need either a good experience of life or education, or both.","I've had a wonderful time in 'Foyle's War' and I don't mind being typecast. But I'm not prim. I'm chaotic, happy, and desperate to have some laughs. I'd love to do a comedy next, or something modern.","I used to run ten miles every other day and eat very little. I was living in London on my own for the first time and no one was checking on me. I wasn't anorexic but lost three stone. I weighed around seven. It lasted six months until I ran out of willpower.","Size zero doesn't make you happy, and I'm not sure I have the discipline for Hollywood. I'm too much of a fan of chocolate and crisps.","When 'Foyle's War' ended in 2010 after seven series, I was sad but not despondent. After all, ITV had already axed the show once in 2007, then brought it back due to public demand.","Politics is not a game for naive thinkers. You may go in as an idealist, but you certainly won't come out as one.","From the very start, if there was a spotlight, I would step into it. My parents wondered what to do with this insufferable show-off. They chose acting for me, and I'm very grateful I can still make a living from it.","I'm looking forward to sproglets but, as I'm the main breadwinner, I feel I ought to capitalise on my career for a bit longer. Mother keeps telling me I should go and freeze some eggs. Not terribly romantic, is it?","'In many ways, I was born a hundred years too late. I often feel out of kilter with the modern world.","It's really good to have so distinctive a name as an actress. No one ever forgets it. My sister and brother are called Perdita and Rollo. Actually, my family calls me 'Hollyhocks.'","If you live in the countryside, you understand that hunting isn't just for toffs. It's for the farmers. It's for everyone's enjoyment.","Acting's incredibly enjoyable, but sometimes it doesn't feel quite enough. I've also written a script about the life of Eleanor of Aquitaine. This will make me sound like a female Kenneth Branagh, but I can't think of anything nicer than directing myself from a script I wrote.","'Foyle's War' made me realise that Churchill actually had questionable morals; his decisions meant that good people died. It must have weighed heavily on his soul, but he never let his personal demons get in the way of what was best for our country.","I have always been a fan of Jim Henson, and I love his Creature Shop creations, the skill of the puppets and the characters he creates.","My father was a tyrant about reading, and that put me off books when I was little.","My health is important to me. I run with my dog, twice or three times a week.","I do cook a lot for myself. I tend to cook from scratch, a lot of stews and things, lots of beans, because beans have got lots of protein in them but not fat. I am partial to a bit of cheese - I try to limit myself in my cheese intake, but I do enjoy a good smelly cheese. Stinking Bishop is a good one.","My dad had a small suitcase stuffed with photos, mementoes from wherever he'd traveled as a Royal Navy gunner. Not that he gunned very much, as it turned out. I'd haul it out and go through it time and time again.","All my grandparents and great aunts and uncle love 'Foyle's War.' They all lived through the war and love to see it reconstructed so authentically.","My uncle worked in emergency wards dealing with people who came in with terrible injuries. He talked about the sketch shows they would put on to lighten the atmosphere. You often find this sense of grim humor in hospitals. The injuries people are suffering are ghastly. You have to laugh at something or you'd otherwise cry.","WI played a young Helena Bonham Carter in a BBC film called 'A Dark Adapted Eye,' and I thought she was a completely spellbinding person. Totally unmoved by other people's expectations, fashions or opinions. She's probably the coolest English actress there is. Incredibly idiosyncratic.","I think Emily Blunt is definitely our finest young female English export. She has an uncanny grace."],"Hong Chau":["I fell into acting because I was really shy, and so at night after work, I took public speaking and improv classes, and I started going to auditions sort of as a dare. That was my version of 'Fear Factor.'","My first job out of college was at PBS as an administrative assistant. I thought I would be on the production side of things.","Giving people the opportunity to sit in a dark theater together and have emotions in public, whether they're laughing or crying - that's what makes me happy.","I love films that aren't just speaking to certain moments in the culture but are something that people can revisit.","Public libraries were a huge source of comfort and joy for me when I was growing up. I still spend time there.","I'm really into ghost towns. I've driven cross-country the past few summers, and I would stop at some ghost towns along the way. They're like a microcosm of America as a whole.","If anyone has to leave their homeland by boat, they all have difficult stories. But my parents had a difficult journey, and their story always seems like a movie to me.","I don't want anyone to think I took this role in 'Downsizing' because it was the only role available to me. I'm not a passive participant in it.","I did a regional car commercial and an internet potato chip commercial. I was seriously thinking I needed to quit and get a serious job where I can feed myself and it doesn't kill my soul.","In life, we are all more than one thing, but for some reason in movies, you're either this or that. It reduces the complexity of a human being in so many ways.","That's what I want to continue to do: really odd films, with interesting filmmakers.","For a good part of my childhood, we were super poor and lived in government housing. I don't characterize the American dream as being successful and having a lot of material wealth to show for it. I did fine without it for a really long time.","I think that a lot of actors of color have said that it's a wonderful thing to play a role that doesn't have a race and that is kind of open to any sort of interpretation. I completely understand that, but at the same time, I just want Asian characters that are well-written.","I don't want to put on any gimmicky layers just to give the character more definition. I just want to play good characters. It doesn't matter to me if it's 'open ethnicity' or 'specifically Asian.'","I grew up around Vietnamese refugees, around people who don't speak English as a first language.","Part of me, even when I was trying to get acting jobs, I was still kind of thinking, 'Oh I should do something else with my life.'","My parents speak with an accent. A lot of people that I know speak with an accent. I have friends who speak with an accent. Accents in a vacuum aren't a problem; it's how you portray those characters and how well they're served in a script.","Americans have a wonderful way of just butchering everyone's names.","I never like to sit and discuss my character, the other character, our relationship, or anything like that. I feel like if I did my job and I trust that the other person has done theirs, you just go on set, play around with it, chew the scene for a little bit; then we roll, and that's it.","I walk on eggshells, and I care too much about what people think, and I'm afraid to ask for things.","My parents are Vietnamese refugees; they left Vietnam after the war. They were part of the boat people, and they ended up in a refugee camp in Thailand after being on the water for three days, and I was born at that refugee camp in Thailand.","I grew out of the habit of thinking or worrying about being seen as the typical Asian. I don't even know what that means anymore. I'm not really concerned with it.","Asian-Americans, we're not a monolithic group. There might be some Asians who are second-generation, third-generation, who may not speak the language that their parents or their grandparents spoke.","We are surrounded by people with accents because America is a nation of immigrants. Beyond that, the people who made your iPhone and the shirt on your back are probably Asians, and we're really not that disconnected from each other; we have very intimate relationships with the world, whether or not we realize it.","I grew up speaking Vietnamese - that was my first language because my parents didn't speak any English, and I didn't learn English until I started school.","Growing up the way I did, being an actor in Hollywood was definitely never a plausible career choice at all.","With 'Downsizing,' a lot of the discussion hasn't been about the film itself, but about cultural and political conversations happening outside of it. It's being digested in the context of the time.","People who I've encountered who have had more given to them, they tend to be more disappointed and unable to carry on when something doesn't go their way, and that's not my parents.","In Hollywood, there's not a ton of roles for Asian people. So a lot of it is waiting and waiting and waiting.","I love public transportation! Who wants to sit in a car and be angry at other drivers for eight hours? I'd rather sit on a bus or train and read a book.","I like to be very simple in my lifestyle. My only extravagance is... I buy lots of toys and meats for my dog.","When you see something that needs to be done, you do it.","I think one in five Americans has a disability of some sort. That's 20% of the population, and yet we rarely ever see people with disabilities on-screen, and their stories and their resilience and their zest for life and their humor and their humanity.","When British or Australian actors perform American characters, we laud them and talk about how great it is they are able to do this other accent that is not their own. Americans have different relationships with other accents.","For me, I do my best work when I feel completely relaxed and not being judged.","I appreciate people who sway to the beat of their own tambourine, like Iris Apfel and Helena Bonham Carter.","I'm never concerned about being first or on trend. I only want to feel like my most rad 'me.'","I love Chicago for several reasons, but one of the best is that I was so intrigued that you have wild rabbits running around in the city. I never had seen bunnies in such a large urban environment before.","The first time I went to Chicago was on a family road trip. We had our dog with us, and when we hit Chicago, I couldn't believe how many people kept coming up to us, telling us how handsome our dog was! He's a Rottweiler-Australian Shepherd mix, and he is a good-looking dog, but obviously Chicago is very dog-friendly.","I really want to work on characters that have a lot of complexity and you don't always get that in comic book movies because they're not character explorations. I have nothing against movies like that, but I do see them as kind of like a cheeseburger.","It's nice to have a quiet movie to give you time to meditate on an idea. A lot of movies don't give you the space to feel anything.","I don't like being watched, and I don't like being told what to do, so acting is a very poor professional choice.","I don't have any special skills or any hidden talents. I don't.","On 'Downsizing,' I had a trailer, and I got to bring my dog to work, and I thought, 'I've made it: I'm bringing my dog to work.'"],"Honor Blackman":["I'm told leather drives men up the wall. I like wearing it because it because it feels nice.","Apart from anything else, I find boots are too hot except in wintry weather. At home I usually wear a sweater, shirt and slacks.","In fact, I'll be taking a lot of Cathy Gale with me. I expect that was why I was chosen for the part.","No More Avengers! There's nothing new to get out of it - I want to go forward, not backward.","My father was in the civil service. I can remember standing in a bus shelter in the pouring rain, and that we were allowed candy floss at the end of the holiday if we had behaved.","I'm very fond of Norfolk. My husband came from there and the kids love it. Devon is beautiful, too.","I hate everything about airports from getting there to taking off.","I've travelled around the UK a lot recently and have discovered that I really like trains. If you're in the quiet carriage, nobody can get hold of you and you can relax.","I'm the slowest reader in the world, because I perform it all in my head.","South Africa is the most beautiful country I have been to. Canada is also hugely underrated.","There have been plenty of very bare hotels with couples humping next door. I don't stay in very grand hotels.","Female television viewers paid attention to Catherine Gale.","Really, in a way, I took over the male role."],"Honor Harger":["We've been surrounded by images of space our whole lives, from the speculative images of science fiction to the inspirational visions of artists to the increasingly beautiful pictures made possible by complex technologies. But whilst we have an overwhelmingly vivid visual understanding of space, we have no sense of what space sounds like.","My job as artistic director at the Brighton digital agency Lighthouse is all about trying to show that digital culture is about more than just tools and gadgets - it's about perceiving the societal transformations being brought about by technology.","Our technologised society is becoming opaque. As technology becomes more ubiquitous and our relationship with digital devices ever more seamless, our technical infrastructure seems to be increasingly intangible.","Radio astronomers study radio waves from space using sensitive antennas and receivers, which give them precise information about what an astronomical object is and where it is in our night sky. And just like the signals that we send and receive here on Earth, we can convert these transmissions into sound using simple analog techniques.","The study of celestial phenomena at radio wavelengths, radio astronomy came into being after the accidental discovery of cosmic radiation by radio engineer Karl Jansky in 1933.","Solar bursts typically last from half a minute to a couple of minutes and often sound like a rapid hissing noise followed by a gradual decrease back to the original audio level.","Radio astronomy reflects our fascination with how audio can be used to understand information or ideas. Just as scientists visualize data through charts and pictures, we can use 'data sonification' to translate radio signals into sound that help us better understand some of our most enigmatic planetary systems."],"Honore de Balzac":["The heart of a mother is a deep abyss at the bottom of which you will always find forgiveness.","One should believe in marriage as in the immortality of the soul.","A mother's happiness is like a beacon, lighting up the future but reflected also on the past in the guise of fond memories.","Clouds symbolize the veils that shroud God.","A woman knows the face of the man she loves as a sailor knows the open sea.","Laws are spider webs through which the big flies pass and the little ones get caught.","True love is eternal, infinite, and always like itself. It is equal and pure, without violent demonstrations: it is seen with white hairs and is always young in the heart.","If we could but paint with the hand what we see with the eye.","A young bride is like a plucked flower; but a guilty wife is like a flower that had been walked over.","A good husband is never the first to go to sleep at night or the last to awake in the morning.","Nobody loves a woman because she is handsome or ugly, stupid or intelligent. We love because we love.","The motto of chivalry is also the motto of wisdom; to serve all, but love only one.","There is no such thing as a great talent without great will power.","Behind every great fortune lies a great crime.","The more one judges, the less one loves.","Love is the poetry of the senses.","Bureaucracy is a giant mechanism operated by pygmies.","It is easy to sit up and take notice, What is difficult is getting up and taking action.","The art of motherhood involves much silent, unobtrusive self-denial, an hourly devotion which finds no detail too minute.","Love has its own instinct, finding the way to the heart, as the feeblest insect finds the way to its flower, with a will which nothing can dismay nor turn aside.","Great love affairs start with Champagne and end with tisane.","Finance, like time, devours its own children.","Conscience is our unerring judge until we finally stifle it.","No man should marry until he has studied anatomy and dissected at least one woman.","Equality may perhaps be a right, but no power on earth can ever turn it into a fact.","A flow of words is a sure sign of duplicity.","We exaggerate misfortune and happiness alike. We are never as bad off or as happy as we say we are.","A lover always thinks of his mistress first and himself second; with a husband it runs the other way.","There is something great and terrible about suicide.","Unintelligent persons are like weeds that thrive in good ground; they love to be amused in proportion to the degree in which they weary themselves.","Society bristles with enigmas which look hard to solve. It is a perfect maze of intrigue.","It is only in the act of nursing that a woman realizes her motherhood in visible and tangible fashion; it is a joy of every moment.","It is easier to be a lover than a husband for the simple reason that it is more difficult to be witty every day than to say pretty things from time to time.","All humanity is passion; without passion, religion, history, novels, art would be ineffectual.","Nothing is a greater impediment to being on good terms with others than being ill at ease with yourself.","When women love us, they forgive us everything, even our crimes; when they do not love us, they give us credit for nothing, not even our virtues.","The most virtuous women have something within them, something that is never chaste.","Our most bitter enemies are our own kith and kin. Kings have no brothers, no sons, no mother!","In diving to the bottom of pleasure we bring up more gravel than pearls.","There are some women whose pregnancy would make some sly bachelor smile.","Between the daylight gambler and the player at night there is the same difference that lies between a careless husband and the lover swooning under his lady's window.","Nothing so fortifies a friendship as a belief on the part of one friend that he is superior to the other.","The smallest flower is a thought, a life answering to some feature of the Great Whole, of whom they have a persistent intuition.","Modesty is the conscience of the body.","Wisdom is that apprehension of heavenly things to which the spirit rises through love.","Small natures require despotism to exercise their sinews, as great souls thirst for equality to give play to their heart.","Children, dear and loving children, can alone console a woman for the loss of her beauty.","Study lends a kind of enchantment to all our surroundings.","A man is a poor creature compared to a woman.","The duration of passion is proportionate with the original resistance of the woman.","The habits of life form the soul, and the soul forms the countenance.","When Religion and Royalty are swept away, the people will attack the great, and after the great, they will fall upon the rich.","Excess of joy is harder to bear than any amount of sorrow.","Thought is a key to all treasures; the miser's gains are ours without his cares. Thus I have soared above this world, where my enjoyment have been intellectual joys.","Courtesy is only a thin veneer on the general selfishness.","Love is a game in which one always cheats.","An unfulfilled vocation drains the color from a man's entire existence.","Virtue, perhaps, is nothing more than politeness of soul.","It is as absurd to say that a man can't love one woman all the time as it is to say that a violinist needs several violins to play the same piece of music.","Power is action; the electoral principle is discussion. No political action is possible when discussion is permanently established.","The man as he converses is the lover; silent, he is the husband.","What is a child, monsieur, but the image of two beings, the fruit of two sentiments spontaneously blended?","Death unites as well as separates; it silences all paltry feeling.","It is the mark of a great man that he puts to flight all ordinary calculations. He is at once sublime and touching, childlike and of the race of giants.","Women are tenacious, and all of them should be tenacious of respect; without esteem they cannot exist; esteem is the first demand that they make of love.","For passion, be it observed, brings insight with it; it can give a sort of intelligence to simpletons, fools, and idiots, especially during youth.","Men die in despair, while spirits die in ecstasy.","What is art? Nature concentrated.","Lovers have a way of using this word, nothing, which implies exactly the opposite.","Love may be or it may not, but where it is, it ought to reveal itself in its immensity.","The fact is that love is of two kinds, one which commands, and one which obeys. The two are quite distinct, and the passion to which the one gives rise is not the passion of the other.","The majority of husbands remind me of an orangutan trying to play the violin.","Power is not revealed by striking hard or often, but by striking true.","Marriage must incessantly contend with a monster that devours everything: familiarity.","If those who are the enemies of innocent amusements had the direction of the world, they would take away the spring, and youth, the former from the year, the latter from human life.","I do not regard a broker as a member of the human race.","Nature makes only dumb animals. We owe the fools to society.","A mother who is really a mother is never free.","Vocations which we wanted to pursue, but didn't, bleed, like colors, on the whole of our existence.","First love is a kind of vaccination which saves a man from catching the complaint the second time.","Passion is universal humanity. Without it religion, history, romance and art would be useless.","Solitude is fine, but you need someone to tell you that solitude is fine.","To kill a relative of whom you are tired is something. But to inherit his property afterwards, that is genuine pleasure.","Political liberty, the peace of a nation, and science itself are gifts for which Fate demands a heavy tax in blood!","Those who spend too fast never grow rich.","Suicide, moreover, was at the time in vogue in Paris: what more suitable key to the mystery of life for a skeptical society?","Manners are the hypocrisy of a nation.","At fifteen, beauty and talent do not exist; there can only be promise of the coming woman.","Ideas devour the ages as men are devoured by their passions. When man is cured, human nature will cure itself perhaps.","To those who have exhausted politics, nothing remains but abstract thought.","Towns find it as hard as houses of business to rise again from ruin.","A husband who submits to his wife's yoke is justly held an object of ridicule. A woman's influence ought to be entirely concealed.","The country is provincial; it becomes ridiculous when it tries to ape Paris.","A grocer is attracted to his business by a magnetic force as great as the repulsion which renders it odious to artists.","When law becomes despotic, morals are relaxed, and vice versa.","The man whose action habitually bears the stamp of his mind is a genius, but the greatest genius is not always equal to himself, or he would cease to be human.","Chance, my dear, is the sovereign deity in child-bearing.","A mother's life, you see, is one long succession of dramas, now soft and tender, now terrible. Not an hour but has its joys and fears.","But reason always cuts a poor figure beside sentiment; the one being essentially restricted, like everything that is positive, while the other is infinite.","Old maids, having never bent their temper or their lives to other lives and other tempers, as woman's destiny requires, have for the most part a mania for making everything about them bend to them.","The life of a man who deliberately runs through his fortune often becomes a business speculation; his friends, his pleasures, patrons, and acquaintances are his capital.","Many men are deeply moved by the mere semblance of suffering in a woman; they take the look of pain for a sign of constancy or of love.","Love or hatred must constantly increase between two persons who are always together; every moment fresh reasons are found for loving or hating better.","It would be curious to know what leads a man to become a stationer rather than a baker, when he is no longer compelled, as among the Egyptians, to succeed to his father's craft."],"Honoré Daumier":["I care more about my pipe than about fame and honors.","Photography imitates everything and expresses nothing.","I start everything 25 times over.","One must be of one's own time."],"Honus Wagner":["In all my years of play, I never saw an ump deliberately make an unfair decision. They really called them as they saw 'em.","I never have been sick. I don't even know what it means to be sick. I hear other players say they have a cold. I just don't know what it would feel like to have a cold - I never had one.","I won't play for a penny less than fifteen hundred dollars.","There ain't much to being a ballplayer, if you're a ballplayer."],"Hooman Majd":["I grew up thinking of myself as an American but also, because of my parents and the Iranian culture that was in our home, as an Iranian. So if there's any such thing as dual loyalty, then I have it - at least culturally.","I was born in Iran, left at a very young age - less than a year old - and grew up and was educated in the West.","Inside Iran, people are actually quite well-educated about America. There are things they don't understand, particularly in the government, but the people, by and large, know the American sensibility quite well, and the reverse is not true.","There's a lack of knowledge about Iran and the Iranian people.","I know that my cell phone in Iran... is bugged, and they listen in, and my emails, I'm sure, are monitored inside Iran. They have my email address; it's not like they can't snoop on it.","The city of Tehran is a very modern metropolis, and there's an emphasis in the Islamic republic on science and advancement and technology.","This sounds like a cliche, but I always wanted to write. After college, I did some writing and realized very quickly that it's hard to make a living as a writer. At that point, I was more interested in fiction writing.","I got a couple of stories published, but the kind of money you were making for publishing a short story, I could see I wasn't going to make a living at it.","As a child, I was always very interested in music and had friends who were in the music business. I kind of accidentally fell into it and loved it. There was no reason not to - it was a great career.","Foreign journalists have to have an approved interpreter assigned them, which they have to pay for, who also acts as guide. As an Iranian, even writing for foreign media, I've been mercifully unrestricted.","The wrong Democratic reaction to a stupid Republican utterance is to play hurt.","A popular bumper sticker post-9/11, and pretty faded these days, proclaims drivers of the cars to be 'Proud to be an American.' It really should say 'Lucky to be an American,' for I doubt very much that the drivers had much say in having been born here, and are not old enough to have participated in the drafting of the Constitution."],"Hope Davis":["The older you get, the more you realize that the way you look is a reflection of how you treat yourself.","I'm not at a point in my life when I'm analyzing too much.","I feel like I'm one of the happiest people I know.","Every summer my husband and I pack our suitcases, load our kids into the car, and drive from tense, crowded New York City to my family's cottage in Maine. It's on an island, with stretches of sea and sandy beaches, rocky coasts, and pine trees. We barbecue, swim, lie around, and try to do nothing.","Storytelling is what lights my fire.","There's nothing I love more than a good cry.","I like to work. I enjoy once a year, doing a film.","I'm usually called upon to play the dreary suicidal girl.","I get to play a lot of hysterics.","You know how a lot of people say they could go crazy? Well, I feel I live very close to that line.","I'm not really high-strung now, but I was a very high-strung child.","I just love to make a whole roomful of people laugh.","I'm a New Yorker, and I rarely get to work at home.","I travel all the time, and I have two small children.","I haven't frequented a nail salon in a long time.","I have a husband and children, and it affects me deeply that somebody could be taken away in a second.","When my dad needed a shirt ironed, he would yell downstairs to my mother, who would drop everything and iron his shirt.","I have not spent years in therapy; I tried therapy in my mid-twenties, and it did not go very well. I just thought, 'This is so not for me. I would rather talk to one of my girlfriends.'","I'm way too disorganized.","I've seen a lot of the United States, having stayed in so many different cities and towns for work.","I love stories that give me a perspective on how easy American life has become in the 21st century.","It's too easy to sum up a person's character in one negative instant, and it doesn't put anything good out into the world.","The network shows tend to be run, in general, in my experience, by committee, and it's hard for actors and writers to do their jobs.","I've seen a lot of the United States, having stayed in so many different cities and towns for work. It's such a strange and fascinating country, and instead of learning about it through a textbook, I would rather discover its history and traditions and institutions through fiction and nonfiction writers.","I have not spent years in therapy; I tried therapy in my mid-twenties, and it did not go very well. I just thought, 'This is so not for me. I would rather talk to one of my girlfriends.' I'm not at a point in my life when I'm analyzing too much. I have young children, and I'm just pretty much crazed.","I would do 'American Splendor' and 'About Schmidt' again in a heartbeat.","The work evolves when you get another part, and then you're getting called on to solve difficult characters, to inject a note of humanity into them. It's more interesting for me to do that than to stand around and be sunny.","I do smaller films, I'm not getting big paydays. I feel like we're just kind of scraping together here.","I was never the ingenue, so hopefully that'll make it easier to age and still work. I know a lot of actors who are really dissatisfied with where they're at even though some of them are huge stars and I feel like, 'Oh, my God, you're at the top.' Something interesting will come. It always does. I have faith.","To play Hillary Clinton? I'm kind of winging it. No, are you kidding me? I prepared obsessively. I mean, as much as I could in the time that I was given. Of course, with someone like Hillary Clinton, obviously, anything you want is on YouTube and at your fingertips there.","But I think Hillary Clinton is one of the most amazing women of this time.","You know what I have noticed? And this is really sad. Flying first class is less scary than flying coach. They speak to you and they're so nice to you and they want to help you and they know you want a drink before the plane takes off. And they bring it to you without asking. If you're sitting in coach and hoping for a drink, good luck.","I've been lucky. I've made films that I really like. It's been a combination of what comes to me and what I choose. I've gone after lots of things that I didn't get, pet projects that everybody ends up chasing after. Really, you're lucky if you get anything."],"Hope Hicks":["There is no substitute for hard work. Never give up. Never stop believing. Never stop fighting.","I'm having so much fun, I'm just going to go where it takes me.","If you work hard and you work for somebody who empowers you and challenges you, you'll be successful.","President Trump has a magnetic personality and exudes positive energy, which is infectious to those around him.","I could really see myself in politics. Who knows?","We get so many requests like, 'We want behind-the-scenes access,' or 'We're going to show people what it's really like to be on the campaign with Donald Trump.' But there is just no way that a camera or an episode or a documentary could capture what has gone on.","I try to be in the office as much as possible to get the full experience working with volunteers, making phone calls, putting out signs - things that the communications director probably normally wouldn't do.","I don't do well in plaid.","I'm not ready to decide if modeling is what I want to do with my life."],"Hope Jahren":["A cactus doesn't live in the desert because it likes the desert; it lives there because the desert hasn't killed it yet.","A tree's wood is also its memoir.","I feel like I'm the same scientist I was back when I couldn't get a grant. Now I'm that same person thinking that same way getting grants. That system of external rewards in science has always mystified me. It's fickle. And I also don't think it was constructed with people like me in mind.","During the mid-1990s, I collected thousands of hackberry fruits from trees all across the Midwest. I chemically analyzed each seed in order to formulate an equation relating the hackberry's mineral makeup to the summer temperature under which it grew.","My father's schooling during the 1930s was heavy with memorization; eight decades later, he is reaping the benefits.","My father was a scientist, and I grew up in his laboratory. Maybe I am like him, but he is not like me.","My father was a physicist, while I am a biogeochemist. I live to study plants, and he has never had more than a generic interest in biology.","The deadnettle is the Punxsutawney Phil of the plant world: short of stature but stout of heart. At the first hint of winter's wane, its stem rises from the ground, and a green, grasping hand of sepals unclenches to divulge two silky-white petals, one of which unfurls straight up toward the sky.","I am not the only scientist to be struck by the power and meaning of Lamium album in bloom.","While both plants and animals awaken via distinct changes in metabolic functioning, most plants prefer to err on the side of caution, waiting for hints of full-on summer before they bloom.","Plants are decisive to a fault. A stem produces a bud that flowers once and once only. It offers pollen that is either dispersed or goes nowhere. One pollen grain either enters a stigma or it falls upon stony ground. An ovum is either fertilized or the whole project stalls out.","When I was 23, my Norwegian relatives taught me how to sit still. During the long sunlit evenings in the summer of 1992, my cousins would lead me across the farm to the edge of the forest, each of us lugging a folding chair. There, in a scraggly bramble of wild blueberries, we would set them down a few yards apart, each in our own little patch.","In my Scandinavian-American family, we were conditioned never to sit, at least not comfortably. I was endlessly going back to work. We longed for the fleeting respite of being useful and regarded sleep as a reward for exhaustion, always to be deferred until after the sun goes down.","What is a berry? It is an ovary swaddled within a sugary womb. Plainly put, a berry is the fruition of a flower - the ultimate tautology.","You can pick wild strawberries with your eyes closed, locating them by smell, for they are two parts perfume to one part taste. An hour of searching might yield a handful if you're lucky. Wild strawberries can't be encouraged, nor can they be discouraged: They come to you unbidden and unearned. They appear, or do not, by the grace of the sun.","Like all professors, I also do a lot of extra jobs for which I was never trained, such as advising former students as they navigate the wider world.","The absence of women within STEM programs is not only progressive, it is persistent - despite more than 20 years of programs intended to encourage the participation of girls and women.","My experiences have also convinced me that sexual harassment is very rarely publicly punished after it is reported, and then only after a pattern of relatively egregious offenses.","The evasion of justice within academia is all the more infuriating because the course of sexual harassment is so predictable. Since I started writing about women and science, my female colleagues have been moved to share their stories with me; my inbox is an inadvertent clearinghouse for unsolicited love notes.","I am a scientist who studies plants. I like plants. I think about plants almost every hour of the day, and several hours of the night as well.","I love rocks with the unconditional love that you lavish upon a newborn baby.","I was a promising graduate student. I landed a position as a professor before I even started to write my dissertation. While I prepared to start my new job, I decided that I would begin by studying the brine that bleeds sideways within the rocks that underlie the inner Aegean region of Turkey.","There is a fundamental and culturally learned power imbalance between men and women, and it follows us into the workplace. The violence born of this imbalance follows us also. We would like to believe that it stops short of following us into the laboratory and into the field - but it does not.","A true scientist doesn't perform prescribed experiments; she develops her own and thus generates wholly new knowledge.","One cannot rule out a blizzard in Minnesota after Labor Day, and so when I travel for Thanksgiving or any time in the fall, I am careful to fly into Des Moines instead of Minneapolis and then drive the 200 miles north to my hometown.","I am not a farmer; I am a researcher who studies the plants that come to your dinner table, which means that I ask questions for a living.","You can't drive through Iowa and not think about farming: No less than 85 percent of the land in the state is devoted to farms, many of them more than 1,000 acres. This is the place where seeds are sown. It's where farmers grow the corn that will be fed to pigs as grain or fed to you as syrup or fermented to ethanol for your gas tank.","We must feed, shelter, and nurture one another as our first priority, and to do so, we must avail ourselves of our best technologies, which have always included some type of genetic modification.","Regardless of politics, our world will continue to change rapidly.","I love the quiet forest that stands between my lab and my home.","We must continue as in millennia past, nourishing the future as we feed ourselves and, each year, plant only the very best of what we have collectively engineered.","There is nothing in the world more perfect than a slide rule. Its burnished aluminum feels cool against your lips, and if you hold it level to the light you can see God's most perfect right angle in each of its corners.","Even a very little girl can wield a slide rule, the cursor serving as a haft.","I grew up in my father's laboratory and played beneath the chemical benches until I was tall enough to play on them.","Plants are not like us, and the more you study plants, the more different and deep ways you see that they are not like us.","I like weeds and hardy plants.","As an environmental scientist, I think our first need is to feed and shelter and nurture. That has always required the exploitation of plant life, and it always will.","I have learned that nothing gets readers so fired up as saying something everyone knows is true.","My life is pretty small. Even as a successful scientist, I'm not a public figure. I like people - I just don't know that many!","It's very important to put children in an environment where they can take things apart; where they can break things and then learn to fix them; where they can trust their hands and know their capacity to manipulate objects.","I think plants present an opportunity for people to look closely at something and get invested in something that's truly very much outside of themselves.","I think the best learning is done with active manipulation. And we need to be able to work with our hands; it's not just about using our brains.","I think there are fundamental power imbalances between the sexes that play themselves out in society. And I think science is just not immune to that - which actually isn't a very controversial stance if you think about it.","Science is performed by people, and it's subject to all the various foibles that plague the rest of our social dynamics.","Women live in a world where we are forced to consider our safety at every turn. We minimize risk while we maximize activity. It's this constant balancing act that we do.","I think, as you move to the upper ranks of science - ranks being positions of influence and access - you see fewer female faces. And I think the basic reason is the same reason that you don't see a lot of female faces in Congress or on the Supreme Court or on the directing board of Fortune 500 companies.","I think it's very common that scientists or technical people have an artistic side. Sometimes they are very accomplished musicians. Sometimes they have very fine tastes according to art or design. And often, they've spent a big chunk of their childhood or they're growing-up years trying to get in very good at those activities.","I love to read stories. And I don't to get to talk about my favorite novels very often in my job.","When I was five, I came to understand that I was not a boy.","My laboratory is like a church because it is where I figure out what I believe.","A seed knows how to wait... A seed is alive while it waits.","In our tiny town, my father wasn't a scientist - he was the scientist, and being a scientist wasn't his job: it was his identity.","I spend a lot of time talking to other scientists and writing to other scientists.","The world is a fickle place, and it's not fair. But if you're getting most of your rewards from you, then you can use that as a kind of compass, and you can be secure in the fact that you're working for the right reason, and you're going in the right direction.","I am a scientist. To be specific, I am a woman scientist. This, I have been told and have come to believe, is a good thing. In fact, it is such a good thing that America needs more of us. Everyone seems to be very sure of this. The thing that no one is sure about, however, is how to make it happen.","I grew up in a small town.","I can explain to you in detail just how a tree can be made into paper. But I've always wondered - and hoped - that someday, someone would help me discover how paper can be made back into a tree.","The type of science that I do is sometimes known as 'curiosity-driven research.' This means that my work will never result in a marketable product, a useful machine, a prescribable pill, a formidable weapon, or any direct gain.","America may say that it values science, but it sure as hell doesn't want to pay for it.","Ask a science professor what she worries about. It won't take long. She'll look you in the eye and say one word: 'Money.'","People love the ocean. People are always asking me why I don't study the ocean, because, after all, I live in Hawaii. I tell them that it's because the ocean is a lonely, empty place.","I'm a scientist - a geobiologist who's been studying trees, flowers, seeds, and soil for over twenty years. One day, I realized that I wanted, needed, to tell people - and not just other scientists - about my life in science.","Each beginning is the end of a waiting. We are each given exactly one chance to be. Each of us is both impossible and inevitable.","Every acorn on the ground is just as alive as the three-hundred-year-old oak tree that towers over it.","In New England, the pin oak thrives, its leaves tipping to a thorny point in a good-natured impression of its evergreen neighbor, the holly bush.","The turkey oak can grow practically submerged within the wetlands of Mississippi, its leaves soft as a newborn's skin.","The live oak can grow sturdily on the hottest hills of central California, contrasting dark green against the golden grass.","Women scientists' hands are like every other woman's hands.","We have to be very careful about acknowledging that the Internet is very good at combatting isolation, but it's not very good at delivering justice.","Your bones are not just made of the last meal you had, but the meals that you've had across many years. By looking at the composition of those teeth, researchers can say that something was a large component of the diet. This tells us a lot about how hominins lived and what they ate.","Corn occupies a really special role in what I've been calling American agro-economics.","My earliest memories are being in the lab, and the way the cement felt and the way it smelled, and the way the countertops looked and it just being this wonderful, warm, happy place where it was just full of toys.","I'm interested in how the bare bones of the planet, things that aren't alive, are transformed into things that are alive.","For a tree, to endure four months of daylight is like you or I going without sleep for four months.","The wood of any tree growing anywhere records fairly faithfully the oxygen and hydrogen chemistry of the water the plant has access to through precipitation.","My lab is the place where I put my brain out on my fingers.","Regardless of what humans do to the climate, there will still be a rock orbiting the sun.","The world breaks a little bit every time we cut down a tree. It's so much easier to cut one down than to grow one. And so it's worth interrogating every time we do it.","I think my job is to leave some evidence for future generations that there was somebody who cared while we were destroying everything.","I think we get used to not seeing the green things around us. I think they become the backdrop of our lives. And I think you actively have to ask somebody to request that they put that in the foreground.","I grew up in a time when there were very few women in the physical sciences. And people started to ask me, 'How did you decide to become a scientist?' And I couldn't really answer. I always knew I'd grow up to have a lab because my dad had one.","If every seed turned into a plant, we'd be living in a very different world.","I think being a scientist is a position of respect and power and access, and it's a privileged position in society. And I think there are fundamental mechanisms that keep men and women from achieving the same level of power and access and privilege in society.","One thing that was very important to me was that I felt comfortable in the lab from being very, very small. I knew that that's where I belonged, and I could fix things and move things. And no matter how many classrooms I went into where I was the only girl in the physics class or whatever, I never questioned the fact that I didn't belong there.","Science is so incremental and so full of setbacks and small steps forward. In order to really thrive in this business, you have to be able to glean as much joy from the failure days and from the small increments as you do from the breakthroughs.","I grew up playing with kids who were the kids of people my parents grew up playing with, and they know me like nobody else. I thought everybody was that way when I was growing up, and then I left to go to college, and I realised that the world is full of strangers.","I always knew how privileged I was to think for a living.","All I have ever wanted is one more day in the lab with the people I care about. And every day that I get that, I am grateful.","Men and women study things differently, and it's not because of our chromosomes. It's a product of our cultural conditioning.","Women study things in order to figure out how they're connected to other things. I don't know if it's controversial to say that, but that's what I've seen from doing science for a couple of decades.","No matter how much funding I get, I'm always thinking, 'This is temporary. This is fragile. It could all end tomorrow, and how am I going to make today worth it? If this is my last day in the lab, what can I do so that I can walk out of here saying, 'That was a good day?''"],"Hope Solo":["I think it's my personality to overcome things, learn from them and become stronger, both personally and professionally. To be honest, I welcome those hardships.","There are so many different walks of life, so many different personalities in the world. And no longer do you have to be a chameleon and try and adapt to that environment - you can truly be yourself.","One thing I've learned through all the ups and downs is that if you're doing things right, then you have a core group of people. Not just a core group like your homies or your buddies, but a group of people that has a good influence on you, who you respect and admire, and you know that if they're on your side, you're doing something right.","I don't need a captain's band to lead a team to victory.","You're not going to be liked by everybody when you speak the truth. I don't speak the truth to put people down; I don't speak the truth to show disrespect.","I just want to stay in my hotel room, read my book. I enjoy that private time.","I take everything with a grain of salt.","I have an attitude. It's what I do. I'm edgy. I have an attitude.","I've learned that winning isn't everything, and it's more about the journey. But at the end of the day, I just want to stand on the podium with the gold medal.","I try to live my life one day at a time, and if I look too far in advance, I get really stressed.","You can predict all you want, but everybody knows what predictions get you.","I carry my iPod everywhere. My favorite group is the John Butler Trio, an Australian jam band. The lead singer and guitarist writes amazing lyrics.","My father showed me so much love. He showed my brother so much love.","My confidence comes from the daily grind - training my butt off day in and day out.","I never wanted to go to college in the state of Washington because I was so embarrassed and ashamed of my family life. I wanted to run. That's what always what I do, I run. I run as far away as I can.","I need a life outside of soccer. So I very much welcome, you know, new love interests and dating and friends and family.","I couldn't have been a great goalkeeper without power, agility and quickness.","I am proud of who I am, and nobody's going to steal that.","I've been through a lot of things in my personal and family life. That turned me into a fighter. I always strive to be the best I possibly can.","I don't just want to focus on soccer, soccer, soccer. You're going to look back 20 years from now and of course you're going to remember the games. But I'm going to remember seeing my family in the stands.","You're always going to survive the pain of loss. I can live with that confidence inside of me.","London 2012 is all about winning a medal. Not just any medal, the gold medal.","I played in Europe and it was a great experience, not just because of my team-mates and the coaches we had, but from the fans and the city itself - I played in Gothenburg and I played in Lyon and soccer was everywhere.","Being responsible and taking care of your body is truly how you make your pay cheque, how you excel and succeed in your lifelong goals, so for me it's just an everyday lifestyle.","When the Olympics and World Cups come around, that's when you see the real outpouring of support that there really is for female football.","I'm just going to embrace every experience.","I like to read books and be alone; I'm not social butterfly person.","My father was never around. But I glorified my father, and I was always daddy's little girl. He was my first soccer coach.","I'm a nerd at heart.","I like to read books and be alone; I'm not social butterfly person. I'm sorry.","Everybody should be affected by their own realities in their own lives, their own struggles in their own lives. It makes us who we are, and we all know that.","I live for competition. It makes my life complete.","All my life, since the time I was little, has been a long distraction. At least that is the way some people want to perceive it, but for me, it's given me a lot of strength.","I think people who don't have conflict in their lives are just trying to please people and not really living life to the fullest.","Every athlete acquires routines as a way to help control nerves.","With each year that's gone by, and as I grow up and get older, I've become more mature, of course, but you have a sense of who you are, and you find confidence in that.","It's a complicated thing, knowing how much pain my father caused in my life and the lives of others whom I love, yet still holding love for him in my heart. No matter what he did, he was my father. He helped create the person I am.","My father showed me so much love. He showed my brother so much love. He just, he had a rough life. You know, he grew up in a boys home in the Bronx. He didn't really know his own family. So I couldn't hold it against him that he didn't know how to parent. He didn't know how to be the perfect husband. But he loved as much as he could.","My life is a beautiful struggle.","It took putting one foot in front of the other every single day to get through it to the point where I made it back on the team and won a gold medal in 2008.","Athletes are extremists. When they're training, it's laser focus.","I think the concept of seeking fame and fortune in women's football in the States is a bit idyllic. Look at all the teams in America that have folded, and the leagues.","I never felt the same passion for the game in the States and there were a lot of headaches, a lot of obstacles to overcome - it didn't just run itself for the love of the game because soccer is not the No. 1 sport as it is in Europe.","In front of the world, all of a sudden I'm a great athlete and I'm put into an environment with 25 other women and I'm expected to go to team meals, team functions.","I never go on Facebook! I like, haven't confirmed anybody to be my friend on Facebook. I have lots of friends; I'm just really bad at Facebook.","I usually tell people I watch like '24' and 'Prison Break.'","I think every athlete has their window of opportunity, and you just have to jump on it. You never know when it can end. So I'm just trying to live large while I have the opportunity.","I think at an early age I learned not to judge people.","I hate the cliche of 'just have fun,' but what I've seen in today's sports, especially with parents, is they put so much pressure on the kids.","A lot of people think I'm naturally confident. I am not naturally confident!","I've always been a fan of Justin Timberlake.","You know journalists. You know the media. They are going to hang on to anything negative they possibly can.","I think the concept of seeking fame and fortune in women's football in the States is a bit idyllic.","My life goes in four-year cycles. The World Cup is every four years and the Olympics are every four years.","I know I can't dance. I am the worst dancer. I have no rhythm. I just do step-and-snap. I love it in the privacy of my own home and every once in a while at a club. But singing and dancing are my two greatest fears.","L.A. is a bit strange. It doesn't seem like the real world.","Of course Seattle loves soccer. You can see from the men's Seattle Sounders team.","My personal life is in the spotlight, but people say what they want to say. The truth isn't in the spotlight, I should say. I'm in the spotlight, but not the truth.","I have a lot of critics; we all know that.","I have no personal beef with Brandi Chastain. There's nothing personal.","On a global stage, I have respect in the goalkeeping world.","When I did 'Dancing With the Stars,' everyone in Hollywood was saying I had too much muscle.","Growing up, I felt insecure about my build. I didn't feel very feminine. But as time went on, I learned to completely embrace my body.","When I was younger, I was a complete tomboy. Then in college I started emerging out of the tomboy stage and dressing differently.","I still don't buy the idea that I'm a 'sex symbol.'","In truth, 2007 was the hardest year of my life. I lost my best friend. I lost my father.","Female athletes are supposed to be toned down. You're always supposed to talk about the team and never stand out.","I don't just want to focus on soccer, soccer, soccer.","I am pushed by my critics. I don't want to say I want to prove them wrong, but it pushes me on the field to play with a chip on my shoulder, and I play best when I have a chip on my shoulder.","I travel a lot and rarely make it home to Seattle.","I wear my dad's cross. It's very important to me. I hang it in my locker before each game.","I think it's my personality to overcome things, learn from them and become stronger, both personally and professionally.","It's clear that women athletics are pretty far behind in every way. In terms of facilities, how much we make, everything.","No one wants to lose, period. It should hurt, it should sting, and you don't want to feel that feeling again.","I have a problem with players who don't take the loss personally. At a professional level you should - it's our job, it's our livelihood, it's who we are at this level. Every loss should be taken that personal.","I've had marriage proposals, invitations to military balls and even a few prom offers from 18-year-old boys.","I love pedicures. And, yes, I have a ton of shoes.","I burn so many calories when I work out that I don't really count calories or necessarily try and stay away from anything.","My No. 1 goal, and what I've spent my entire life striving to achieve is to win a World Cup. I want to retire so badly with that World Cup, but if I don't, then I'll retire knowing that I've done everything I could to get it.","I think people have different definitions of team unity. My definition is doing whatever it takes to win, what makes a great team; it's performance on the field, respect on the field.","As women professional athletes, you have to have respect for every player and individual. Beyond that, it doesn't matter what your interests are. People can have their own lives.","Nobody really knows who I am, where I came from, what's in my heart, why I believe in the things I believe, what I see behind the scenes and they don't see.","Unfortunately, people think I'm negative and bitter all the time, and that's not the case."],"Horace Gray":["Botanically speaking, tomatoes are the fruit of a vine, just as are cucumbers, squashes, beans and peas.","Every citizen or subject of another country, while domiciled here, is within the allegiance and the protection, and consequently subject to the jurisdiction, of the United States."],"Horace Greeley":["The darkest hour in any man's life is when he sits down to plan how to get money without earning it.","Journalism will kill you, but it will keep you alive while you're at it.","Common sense is very uncommon.","Fame is a vapor; popularity an accident; riches take wings; the only earthly certainty is oblivion.","Go west, young man.","Apathy is a sort of living oblivion.","Always rise from the table with an appetite, and you will never sit down without one.","There is no bigotry like that of 'free thought' run to seed.","Ease up, the play is over.","I never said all Democrats were saloonkeepers; what I said was all saloonkeepers are Democrats.","I am the inferior of any man whose rights I trample underfoot.","The illusion that times that were are better than those that are, has probably pervaded all ages."],"Horace Mann":["Lost - yesterday, somewhere between sunrise and sunset, two golden hours, each set with sixty diamond minutes. No reward is offered, for they are gone forever.","Education then, beyond all other devices of human origin, is the great equalizer of the conditions of men, the balance-wheel of the social machinery.","A human being is not attaining his full heights until he is educated.","When a child can be brought to tears, and not from fear of punishment, but from repentance he needs no chastisement.

Outside of this ark all is deluge.","Jails and prisons are the complement of schools; so many less as you have of the latter, so many more must you have of the former.","Seek not greatness, but seek truth and you will find both.","To pity distress is but human; to relieve it is Godlike.","Unfaithfulness in the keeping of an appointment is an act of clear dishonesty. You may as well borrow a person's money as his time.","A teacher who is attempting to teach without inspiring the pupil with a desire to learn is hammering on cold iron.","Education alone can conduct us to that enjoyment which is, at once, best in quality and infinite in quantity.","Habit is a cable; we weave a thread of it each day, and at last we cannot break it.","Every addition to true knowledge is an addition to human power.","A house without books is like a room without windows. No man has a right to bring up his children without surrounding them with books, if he has the means to buy them.","Doing nothing for others is the undoing of ourselves.","If any man seeks for greatness, let him forget greatness and ask for truth, and he will find both.","Manners easily and rapidly mature into morals.","Scientific truth is marvelous, but moral truth is divine and whoever breathes its air and walks by its light has found the lost paradise.","Much that we call evil is really good in disguises; and we should not quarrel rashly with adversities not yet understood, nor overlook the mercies often bound up in them.","If evil is inevitable, how are the wicked accountable? Nay, why do we call men wicked at all? Evil is inevitable, but is also remediable.","Evil and good are God's right hand and left.","Resolve to edge in a little reading every day, if it is but a single sentence.

I have faith in this country, because I have faith in its people.","I will be guided by the Christian ethic and an awareness that human action is by nature transient.","If we know where we want to go, then even a stony road is bearable.","In my view, the humanity of our world can be measured against the fate of Africa.","After a Polish Pope, whose country was first to be invaded by the Germans in World War Two, we now have someone from the generation drafted at the close of the war.","It is just not enough to strengthen the secret services for the fight against terrorism but it's also necessary to advance dialogue between cultures.","It is particularly moving, and I can say this also as a Protestant Christian, that a German - one of us - has been made Pope.","Korea's early repayment of the full amount of loans from the IMF is a major milestone."],"Hortense Odlum":["How many wives have been forced by the death of well-intentioned but too protective husbands to face reality late in life, bewildered and frightened because they were strangers to it!","It is not serving, but servility, that is menial.","It seemed pathetic and terrible to me and it still does, that men and women work eight hours a day at jobs that bring them no joy, no reward save a few dollars.","No life if it is properly realized is without its cosmic importance.","One of the greatest satisfactions one can ever have, comes from the knowledge that he can do some one thing superlatively well.","If a person goes to his job with a firm determination to give of himself the best of which he is capable, that job no matter what it is takes on dignity and importance."],"Horton Foote":["I believe very deeply in the human spirit, and I have a sense of awe about it.

And yet something about them retains a dignity. They face life and they don't ask quarters.","I often write about nonreligious people, and I try to find situations where their sense of humanity is restored or discovered. I think you can be a good person in many ways. And I think you often have to be careful that prayer can seem superficial, because it's a very complicated thing to love your neighbor as yourself.","I have enormous respect for the human being because they're asked to take on a lot. And I don't think there's any easy solution. But I think the journey is what you have to finally be satisfied with, but not be afraid of the lessons one has to learn... it ends up as grace. And you grow; you find a way to continue.","I'm a social writer in the sense that I want to record, but not in the sense of trying to change people's minds.","A writer has an inescapable voice. I think it's inherent in the nature, and I think that we don't control it anymore than we control what we want to write about.","I've redone plays of mine and made changes. A play is a living thing, and I'd never say I wouldn't rewrite years later. Tennessee Williams did that all the time, and it's distressing, because I'd like the play to be out there in its finished form.","I've lived long enough to know things go in and out of fashion, and things not well received now can be totally reversed years later.","I don't think I'll ever stop writing. I write almost every day. I'd write plays even if they were never done again. You're at the mercy of whatever talent you have.","My first memory was of stories about the past - a past that, according to the storytellers, was superior in every way to the life then being lived. It didn't take me long, however, to understand that the present was all we had, for the past was gone, and nothing could be done about it.","I so earnestly believe that prayer can be helpful and guide you and protect you and inspire you. I mean, I'm in awe.","A lot of writing is thinking.","In New York, there are a lot of plays to see, and I try to see as many as I can.","Early on, I said to myself that I would like to write a kind of moral and spiritual history of a place. It sounds a little pretentious, I know. But that's really what I set for myself.","My mother, twenty-two, was Harriet Gautier Brooks, named for her paternal grandmother, but always called Hallie.

It is no friend to virtue, and always an enemy to happiness.","Doubt is the incentive to truth and inquiry leads the way.","Education commences at the mother's knee, and every word spoken within hearsay of little children tends toward the formation of character.","No one has a greater asset for his business than a man's pride in his work.","Preaching is to much avail, but practice is far more effective.

According to this same report, individuals aged 50+ are the least healthy.","The good news is that even minimal activity can significantly extend life.","I think in the wake of Katrina, the Coast Guard may well have been the only entity or agency that came out of that exercise free of fault and free of blame.","When the government is handed over to the Iraqi Council on 30 June, many have declared, oh, the Americans must never leave because civil unrest may erupt. Well, I agree, we cannot abruptly depart, but Iraq needs to step up to the plate on 30 June.","Tonight, I concurred with President Bush when he stated that the decisions on future involvement of U.S. troops in Iraq should be left to the Pentagon and not politicians in Washington.","The closer Iraq approaches freedom and democracy, the more impediments and barriers the terrorists will erect.","Of the five House Calendars, the Private Calendar is the one to which all Private Bills are referred. Private Bills deal with specific individuals, corporations, institutions, and so forth, as distinguished from public bills which deal with classes only.","It was fairly obvious to anyone who studied the situation that China was dumping bedroom furniture in the U.S. to the detriment of our American workers and manufacturers to gain market access and share.","I was heartened to hear the President say that as we make progress on the ground, and Iraqi forces increasingly take the lead, we should be able to further decrease our troop levels.","I look forward to working with our leadership team to advance the causes of smaller government, lower taxes, eliminating terrorism, and providing affordable health care, among other issues.","I fear that CAFTA will accelerate the demise of these domestic textile jobs.","I am told that the majority of Iraqis wanted Saddam removed from power, but they were unwilling and were incapable of doing the job themselves because they feared Saddam and knew the pain and torture he was capable of inflicting upon them.","I am looking forward to a series of productive meetings in both Austria and Estonia, particularly what role organized crime plays in the Baltic drug trade.","I am appreciative of the Bush administration's commitment to fair trade by looking at the facts in this case and ruling affirmatively for the implementation of quotas in this specific category.","I agree with the President that second-guessing is not a strategy, but at the same time, I want to continue the dialogue that ultimately will lead to bringing all of our troops home.","Finally, I do not believe that we should punish American families who have worked diligently to provide for themselves and want to pass along their success to their children and grandchildren.","Eliminating the Death Tax will continue to restore consumer confidence, spur capital investment, and create new jobs which are critical components of economic growth, particularly within the small business community.","Currently, most States do not recognize within their borders concealed carry permits issued in other States.","At a time when we have much work to do to address our Nation's critical infrastructure, and, as I said, which is currently in dire need of upgrade and repair, this legislation is also a jobs bill and is obviously a jobs creator.","As I have been saying for more than a year now, turning this vital mission over to the Iraqi people as soon as possible should remain a topic of debate for Congress while relying on our military commanders to set up the timetable.","An indictment is not a conviction.","After 20 years in Congress, I still believe that smaller government and lower taxes are the most effective economic policies."],"Howard Cosell":["The ultimate victory in competition is derived from the inner satisfaction of knowing that you have done your best and that you have gotten the most out of what you had to give.","What's right isn't always popular. What's popular isn't always right.","Sports is the toy department of human life.","The importance that our society attaches to sport is incredible. After all, is football a game or a religion? The people of this country have allowed sports to get completely out of hand.","Then there is a still higher type of courage - the courage to brave pain, to live with it, to never let others know of it and to still find joy in life; to wake up in the morning with an enthusiasm for the day ahead.","After all, is football a game or a religion?","I was right to back Muhammad Ali, but it caused me major enmity in many areas of this nation.","Sports is human life in microcosm.","Mommy, why does daddy cuss the TV and call it Howard?"],"Howard Crosby":["A wisely chosen illustration is almost essential to fasten the truth upon the ordinary mind, and no teacher can afford to neglect this part of his preparation.","To let politics become a cesspool, and then avoid it because it is a cesspool, is a double crime.","The great unity which true science seeks is found only by beginning with our knowledge of God, and coming down from Him along the stream of causation to every fact and event that affects us."],"Howard Dean":["This is a struggle of good and evil. And we're the good.","From a religious point of view, if God had thought homosexuality is a sin, he would not have created gay people.","I've waffled before. I'll waffle again.","Hypocrisy is a value that I think has been embraced by the Republican Party. We get lectured by people all day long about moral values by people who have their own moral shortcomings.","Look, I'm not a perfect person. I have my warts. I sometimes say things that get me in trouble. I wear suits that are cheap. But I say what I think and I believe what I say, and I'm willing to say things that are not popular but ordinary people know are right.","I don't care what you label me as long as you call me president.","I think most people... would be glad to pay the same taxes they paid when Bill Clinton was president, if only they could have the same economy they had when Bill Clinton was president.","The State of the Union may look rosy from the White House balcony or the suites of George Bush's wealthiest donors. But hardworking Americans will see through this president's efforts to wrap his radical agenda with a compassionate ribbon.","The issue is not abortion. The issue is whether women can make up their own mind instead of some right-wing pastor, some right-wing politician telling them what to do.","We need to go everywhere. There is not one county in this state, I don't care how far west you go, that doesn't have Democrats. We have to be proud of who we are.","I will use whatever position I have in order to root out hypocrisy. Democrats have strong moral values. Frankly, my moral values are offended by some of the things I hear on programs like 'Rush Limbaugh,' and we don't have to put up with that.","The Democratic Party, all the candidates from Washington, they all know each other, they all move in the same circles, and what I'm doing is breaking into the country club.","Every day it becomes clearer that this was the wrong war at the wrong time.","Real Democrats don't make promises they can't keep.","I still want to be the candidate for guys with Confederate flags in their pickup trucks. We can't beat George Bush unless we appeal to a broad cross-section of Democrats.","The fact is that we wouldn't be in Iraq if it weren't for Democrats like Senator Kerry.","John Ashcroft is not a patriot, John Ashcroft is a descendant of Joseph McCarthy.","I've always been endorsed by the National Rifle Association.","I have my warts. I sometimes say things that get me in trouble. In other words, I lead with my heart and not my head. That's the only chance we have against George Bush.","Someone earlier made a remark about losing 500 soldiers and 2,200 wounded in Iraq. Those soldiers were sent there by the vote of Sen. Lieberman, Sen. Edwards and Sen. Kerry. I think that is a serious matter.","We've not had one Republican president in 34 years balance the budget. You can't trust right-wing Republicans with your money. You ought to hire somebody who has balanced a budget. I'm much more conservative with money than George Bush is.","We won't always have the strongest military.","There's not one person in this crowd who's gonna agree with everything I say. Not one.","As Commander in Chief of the United States Military, I will never send our sons and daughters and our brothers and sisters to die in a foreign land without telling the truth about why they're going there.","At every turn when there has been an imbalance of power, the truth questioned, or our beliefs and values distorted, the change required to restore our nation has always come from the bottom up from our people.","I'm just deeply disappointed that once again we may have to settle for the lesser of two evils.","People have said I'm the candidate of anger. Well, we have a right to be angry. We lost 3 million jobs. We lost our place as the moral leader of the world.","This country was the moral leader of the world until George Bush became president.","The way we're going to win elections in this country is not to become Republican lite. The way we're going to win elections in this country is to stand up for what we believe in.","Tom DeLay ought to go back to Houston where he can serve his jail sentence.","I hate Republicans and everything they stand for.","I'm a committed Christian. I worship in my own way. That's my business. That's not the business of the pharisees who are going to preach to me about what I do and then do something else.","The idea that we're going to win this war is an idea that unfortunately is just plain wrong.","Not one Republican president has balanced the budget in 34 years. You can not trust Republicans with your money.","We have to say what we believe... whether it's popular or not.","Luckily, I'm a governor - so I get to tell you what I've already done not just what I'm going to do.","I like John Kerry. I think he's intellectually curious and very thoughtful. I think he's deeply committed on issues like the environment. I think he's an internationalist, which I am.","So what we - all we really want, I think, from the so-called Democratic wing of the Democratic Party is really to stand up for what we believe in.","I think the recovery hasn't been stronger because the hole that was dug for President Obama by the Bush administration was far worse than anybody could imagine, first of all.","Second of all, I don't think Wall Street is doing what it's supposed to be doing, even after the shameful performance of the last two years. They're are not allocating capital.","When you - when you - and this is still going on today - are making your money by pushing paper around, when you should be making your money by investing venture capital in various job-creating things, that makes it much harder to recover.","There are no ideas in the Republican Party right now in the Congress. They're the party of no. They desperately need some intellectual leadership. And whatever you think of Newt Gingrich, he can supply intellectual leadership. So I hope he does run.","So the - the part of the problem is not just the rhetoric. It's the fact that we - we're so polarized in what we've done to each other as parties over the last thirty years in redistricting that it's very, very hard to overcome your own constituencies and move to the middle.","The status quo helps liberals. We're going to change the country.","That's one of the things about the Tea Party people. They think corporations have too much influence in American life and they do."],"Howard Deutch":["The Method helps actors connect in a way that is deeper and more real. So they use themselves instead of playing an idea of the character. It's more emotionally true when it comes from them.","I've done a lot of movies, and they didn't all stick.","If you're able to put humor into something, just like it happens in life, you might get away with it.","Gleason was a rough guy. Like all of these comics, I have never known one who is a sweetheart all the way through.","Alex Skarsgard is a dream actor."],"Howard Dietz":["Composers shouldn't think too much - it interferes with their plagiarism.","A day away from Tallulah is like a month in the country.","Time hurries by, we're here and gone.","I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance.","The world is a stage, the stage is a world of entertainment."],"Howard E.

Wasdin":["People think SEALs are cold-blooded, heartless, wound-up, brainwashed killers. They imagine you can just point a SEAL in a direction and say, 'Go kill.' The truth is you're talking about a bunch of kind-hearted, jovial guys. The only thing that separates them is mental toughness.","The heart and soul of a Navy SEAL is somebody who's committed to their country and committed to their teammates.","I can take just about anyone and make them physically strong.","The guy who finally pulled the trigger on Osama bin Laden is not patting himself on the back. He's giving as much credit to his teammates who got him to that position.","Seal Team Six is a different unit than the rest of the SEAL teams inasmuch as they concentrate primarily on one thing, counter-terrorism, hostage rescue.","If you've never met a Navy SEAL and you ran into one at a bar, you probably still wouldn't know he's a Navy SEAL.","I want to share some insight into why someone would want to be a SEAL. A lot of us faced obstacles growing up. I didn't have any type of real nurturing as a kid. I hope people will relate to my story and go, 'Hey, if this guy can do it, so can I.'","All SEALS in my mind are equally elite. It doesn't matter if you're SEAL Team Two, One, Six, 10, it doesn't matter. All SEALS are equally elite."],"Howard Fast":["In L.A., you work like hell because there is nothing else to do, unless you're cheating on your wife.","A man who will traduce those who stood with him in battle is not worth much.","I was part of a generation that believed in socialism and finally found that belief corroded and destroyed. That is not renouncing Communism or socialism. It's reaching a certain degree of enlightenment about what the Soviet Union practices.","My books were attacked constantly by the Communist Party for not hewing to the Party line. I have never hewed to a Party line of any kind.","Since I believe that a person's philosophical point of view has little meaning if it is not matched by being and action, I found myself willingly wed to an endless series of unpopular causes, experiences which I feel enriched my writing as much as they depleted other aspects of my life.","To be dogmatic about a cause you believe in at the age of 20 or 30 is not unusual. But to be dogmatic at age 55 or 60 shows a lack of any learning capacity.","The only thing that infuriates me is that I have more unwritten stories in me than I can conceivably write in a lifetime.","Like most thoughtful people who watch what's going on in Washington, venting is very necessary.","Americans have no sense of history. And not much memory. They don't remember what happened yesterday.","I was in federal prison in West Virginia for three months for contempt of Congress for a refusing to comply with a request of a Congressional committee of Congress, the House Un-American Activities Committee.","After the Spanish Civil War against Franco, a group of us got together: a group of well-to-do people who were sympathetic to the lost cause of a Republican state. We bought a convent in Toulouse and converted it into a hospital run by the Unitarians. It took care of the Spanish refugees who fled to Toulouse.","I always thought that socialism here would be peculiarly American, with some reasonable, post-industrial evolution between working-class needs and market forces. It won't be bloody like the Russian Revolution.","A critic is a eunuch working in a harem. He watches it, but he knows he can't do it. Critics very often are failed writers and, like failed priests, they hate religion.","I'm disenchanted with Communism and most other things. I'm cynical but not a cynic. I'm cynical about TV, Congress, and commercial peanut butter.","The Rosenberg case had been orchestrated to an anti-Communist frenzy that matched the exuberant hysteria of the Nazi horror.","It's been said that I am the most widely read writer of the 20th century.

I'm talking about the mainstream media, which is being destroyed by the opposition.","The notion of a neutral, mainstream national media gained dominance only in World War II and in its aftermath, when what turned out to be a temporary moderate consensus came to govern the country.","The crusades of Vietnam and Watergate seemed like a good idea at the time, even a noble one, not only to the press but perhaps to a majority of Americans.","As Walter Cronkite would say, that's the way it is.","It's hard to know now who, if anyone, in the media has any credibility.","If we are lucky, and George W. Bush is right, we are about to witness the War of the Happy Iraqis.","When Americans invade Iraq, Bush says, we will be greeted as liberators by the Iraqi people, proving that taking out Saddam Hussein was the right thing to do.","Remember the picture of the president in the classroom, being told of the attack by chief of staff Andy Card? The American people thought they were seeing a man suddenly thrust into a grave challenge no one could have anticipated.","By Rice's own standards, the war was well underway by the time he took office. He was a war president the moment he took the oath. But did he act like one?","Asked at the hearing why she hadn't pressed the FBI more closely about what it knew, or didn't know, about domestic terrorist threats, Rice acted as though the question was an odd one: it wasn't her job. Well, in retrospect, it was and now certainly is.","I know that from the days of Watergate... the notion of two sources on a story has become the popular dogma about how you confirm something. And there is a lot of truth to that, but there are all kinds of ways to check to the extent that you can, a story that you get."],"Howard Finster":["I came here as a man of visions.

I still think it could be done, perpetual motion. I had a vision of a un resist able windmill.","Well, as far as I'm concerned, I'm not here to live a normal life.

And calls to the universities begun to take me out of my garden, you know.","I never did buy things on credit, I always paid for 'em, because I can't see much difference in paying for something and just waiting a week and pay interest on it; that looks foolish to me.","I had a call to the University of Miami where I'd run a revival in 1950.","Every time that we've ever fought, we fought to keep from bein' destroyed. We've never started a war.","But, when I had this feeling and started painting sacred art, as I had this feeling to do, then it come to me: my problem is I'll get a lot of criticism and another problem is my work's not good enough to sell.","As for me, I'm just passin' through this planet."],"Howard Florey":["Apart from the scientific interest attached to my various journeyings, it has been made clear to me that human needs and aspirations differ little the world over and that no great difficulties arise in one race dealing with another when matters of scientific importance are involved.","Perhaps the most useful lesson which has come out of the work on penicillin has been the demonstration that success in this field depends on the development and coordinated use of technical methods.","I feel we must all exert ourselves to the utmost to see that the ideals and hopes held by Alfred Nobel, whom we commemorate today, do not fail from lack of purpose on the part of scientists."],"Howard Gardner":["Anything that is worth teaching can be presented in many different ways. These multiple ways can make use of our multiple intelligences.","The biggest communities in which young people now reside are online communities.","I believe that the brain has evolved over millions of years to be responsive to different kinds of content in the world. Language content, musical content, spatial content, numerical content, etc.","By nature, I am not an optimist, though I try to act as if I am.","I am knowledgeable enough about the world of prizes to realize that there is a large degree of luck - both for the recognitions that you receive and those that you did not.","If I know you're very good in music, I can predict with just about zero accuracy whether you're going to be good or bad in other things.","If we were to abandon concern for what is true, what is false, and what remains indeterminate, the world would be totally chaotic. Even those who deny the importance of truth, on the one hand, are quick to jump on anyone who is caught lying.","Stories are the single most powerful tool in a leader's toolkit.","Kids go to school and college and get through, but they don't seem to really care about using their minds. School doesn't have the kind of long term positive impact that it should.","A lot of knowledge in any kind of an organization is what we call task knowledge. These are things that people who have been there a long time understand are important, but they may not know how to talk about them. It's often called the culture of the organization.","The countries who do the best in international comparisons, whether it's Finland or Japan, Denmark or Singapore, do well because they have professional teachers who are respected, and they also have family and community which support learning.","I need to add that my work on multiple intelligences received a huge boost in 1995 when Daniel Goleman published his book on emotional intelligence. I am often confused with Dan. Initially, though Dan and I are longtime friends, this confusion irritated me.","My belief in why America has been doing so well up to now is that we have been propelled by our immigrants and our encouragement of technical innovation and, indeed, creativity across the board.","Well, if storytelling is important, then your narrative ability, or your ability to put into words or use what someone else has put into words effectively, is important too.","I'd rather see the United States as a beacon of good work and good citizenship, rather than as #1 on some international educational measurement.","While I've worked on many topics and written many books, I have not abandoned my interest in multiple intelligences.","I align myself with almost all researchers in assuming that anything we do is a composite of whatever genetic limitations were given to us by our parents and whatever kinds of environmental opportunities are available.","Twenty-five years ago, the notion was you could create a general problem-solver software that could solve problems in many different domains. That just turned out to be totally wrong.","Til 1983, I wrote primarily for other psychologists and expected that they would be the principal audience for my book."],"Howard Gordon":["I'm a member of the Pacific Council on International Policy.","I've always wanted to write a novel. It's overwhelming and daunting, and it's one of those things that every writer fantasizes about doing.","I'm one of three brothers.","Traditionally, people have been adapting novels and short stories forever. Now, they're doing it simultaneously, with an eye towards writing the movie before the novel has even come out or been finished.

And so we're going to have to do a better job.","People are hungry not because there aren't enough farmers or food, but because they don't have access to it or can't afford it.","The whole concept behind 'Forty Chances' is really a mindset: If everybody thought they had to put themselves out of business in 40 years, you had 40 chances to succeed in what your primary goals are, you would probably be more urgent and you would be forced to change quicker.","You can't just stick with something that doesn't work.","We've learned that project by project, you can't change millions and millions of lives.","Crop insurance should be a policy that keeps people from going broke, to make sure they can farm next year, but not to make them rich.","I've always loved being outdoors, getting my hands dirty.","My parents had a gardener when I was growing up, and he and I would dig in the dirt together - my mom and dad were definitely not digging with me! When I was 5, he helped me plant some corn in our backyard, and I remember how fascinating it was to watch it grow. Little did I know that 50 years later I'd be growing corn in a different way.","My mom told me I never had enough Tonka toys when I was growing up.","Eliminating hunger in America is doable, because we have the resources to do it.","Sometimes, the things we think are so simple but not so easy to grasp are the things that work the best.","Let me tell you about a place where technology won't work. When you walk onto a farm and are standing on soil, there is no technology that is going to take that soil and transform it into something that is five times more productive.","Africa is the most weathered continent in the world; 75 percent of its soil has been degraded. You don't just bring that back.

But the truth is I have a long history of ties to Latin America. Some of my best friends are in Latin America.","A lot of crops depend on labor, but they're done by farmers that don't communicate with one another. They're never in the same room together.","Each of us has about 40 chances to accomplish our goals in life. I learned this first through agriculture, because all farmers can expect to have about 40 growing seasons, giving them just 40 chances to improve on every harvest.","I have spent more than a decade trying to improve the lives of some of the most vulnerable people on earth, and they've taught me countless lessons.","Approaching life through '40 Chances' gives reasons to hope and actions to take, and it offers fresh approaches that our world desperately needs."],"Howard Hawks":["When you've got some talent, your job is to use it.","A good movie is three good scenes and no bad scenes.","I try to tell my story as simply as possible, with the camera at eye level.","There's action only if there is danger.","I'm a storyteller - that's the chief function of a director. And they're moving pictures, let's make 'em move!","I made 'Rio Bravo' with John Wayne. It worked out pretty well and we both liked it, so a few years later we decided to make it again. Worked out pretty good that time, too.","I get a little sick of these New Yorkers who want me to make some psychic thing, like 'The Left-Handed Gun.' They don't know anything about Western history.","I think girls who insult people are very attractive.","Too many actors try to get too much out of scenes that they ought to be leaving alone, just doing them quickly and getting the hell out.","I have a theory that the only way you can be any good is if the camera likes you. If the camera doesn't like you, you are gone.","If you want to make pictures and enjoy making them, you better go out and make something that a lot of people want to see. And then they'll turn you lose and let you make what you want. And then maybe you can do some of the things that you want to do. But as a beginner, you haven't got a chance.","I guarantee you that two directors that are any good can take the same story, change the name of the characters, change the name of the town, and make an entirely different picture.","You can't fix a bad script after you start shooting. The problems on the page only get bigger as they move to the big screen.","I'm such a coward that unless I get a good writer, I don't want to make a picture.","John Wayne represents more force, more power than anyone else on the screen.","The western is the simplest form of drama - a gun, death.","It's hard not to think of Jack Ford when you're making a Western. Hard not to think of him when you're making any picture."],"Howard Hodgkin":["My friends tend to be writers. I think writers and painters are really all the same-we just sit in our rooms.","I am happy for people to talk about my pictures, but I wish devoutly that I was not expected to talk about them myself.","When I finish a painting, it usually looks as surprising to me as to anyone else.","I want my pictures to be things. I want them to be made up of marks that are physically and individually self-sufficient.","I think words come between the spectator and the picture.","I look at my pictures, and I think, 'Well, how did I do that?'","A painting is finished when the subject comes back, when what has caused the painting to be made comes back as an object.","The picture surface recedes just as much in the 20th century as it did in the 15th. The techniques of making pictures have hardly changed.","I think that words are often extraneous to what I do.","I hate painting.","I don't look at the work of my contemporaries very much; I tend to look at pictures by dead artists. It's much easier to get near their paintings.","I don't really have a historical overview of my work at all. I'm not an art historian. I don't see that there's this period and that period.","I don't think you can lightly paint a picture. It's an activity I take very seriously.","Matisse was very clear about saying that you have to blow your own trumpet and explain yourself, which I think has been slightly forgotten.","In England, it's thought to be morally suspect to worry about what your surroundings look like.","A collection makes its own demands. Many artists have been collectors. I think of it rather as an illness. I felt it was using up too much energy.","Collecting has been my great extravagance. It's a way of being. I collect for the same reason that I eat too much-I'm one of nature's shoppers.","I'm vulnerable to criticism. Any artist is, because you work alone in your studio and, until recently, critics were the only way you'd get any feedback.","I am isolated as an artist, not as a person.","I find old copies of National Gallery catalogues, which are written in the dryest possible prose, infinitely soothing.","You keep on balancing and balancing and balancing until the picture wins, because then the subject's turned into the picture.","I fell through a crack for years. Historically, I am a nothing because I fit in no category. I can only be me.","In the United States there has been a kind of a structure in the Modern art world. The New York School was nearly a coherent thing-for a minute.","My language is what I use, and if I lost that, I wouldn't be able to say anything.","I once was interviewed and got so exasperated that I said, 'What do you want, a shopping list?' They kept asking, 'What's in this picture?'","I'm very envious of the few artists who are any good and still do portraits."],"Howard Hughes":["I'm not a paranoid deranged millionaire.","Once you consent to some concession, you can never cancel it and put things back the way they are.","Every man has his price, or a guy like me couldn't exist.","The Hercules' was a monumental undertaking.

I put the sweat of my life into this thing.","My father told me, never have partners.","Money can't buy happiness.","Play off everyone against each other so that you have more avenues of action open to you.","Wash four distinct and separate times, using lots of lather each time from individual bars of soap.","We don't have a monopoly. Anyone who wants to dig a well without a Hughes bit can always use a pick and shovel."],"Howard Jacobson":["I am happiest now. There's nothing like running out of time to make you realise you're in the right skin, with the right person, and that the Apocalypse will happen with or without you.","You don't remember people you love by the wise things they say but the silly things they do.","I have never met an intelligent optimist. That is not to say I think pessimism makes you intelligent, but I have always felt like an Old Testament Jeremiah or Cassandra from ancient Greece. I want to run down the streets warning people.","Of my old tendency to overdo the dedication and deface the title page with florid compliments and obscure quotes which the recipient cannot read, I will say only that I learnt my lesson when I had to shell out with my own money for a hardback I'd vandalised and now limit myself to 'Good wishes.'","Sensitivity doesn't necessarily make you easy to get on with.","No traveller ever sets out with so little idea of where he is going or how he is going to get there than an artist does. And no traveller ever gets to a more wonderful place.","You won't get a rational assessment of a political party from a member, and you won't get a reasoned account of the joys of being 'linked' from somebody who's already 'in.'","Everything is allowable in literature, but what is not allowable in criticism is objection on the grounds of probability.","It would be nice if we could all agree to this proposition: popularity is not the same as achievement.","Economics is not a science; it is a quasi-religion: part superstition, part mystique, part sentimentality. Bankers dream like other men, the only difference being that when their dreams turn to nightmares, we all lose sleep. There can be no trusting the muttering of any prelate when it comes to money.","Leaned on by Turkey and understandably wary of false equivalences - for not every death is a massacre, and not every war is genocidal - Israel connives in Armenian genocide denial.","Let's be honest with one another: almost everything is too long except life, and I know people who wouldn't even concur with that exception.","Imagine the anticlimax of opening a novel you'd just got Dostoyevsky to sign and finding 'Keep smiling - Fyodor.'","Rejection is the one constant of human experience.","It's a weakness of mine to forget what it is I've just been talking about so that when people make witty allusions to it, I stare at them open-mouthed, not knowing what they're talking about.","I've always liked older women. One sad thing about being my age is that there are no older women. I used to amuse my mother's friends even at five or six with witty turns of phrase. Somehow, I just knew how to be funny.","You don't divorce simply because your spouse has a number of qualities you dislike and on occasions makes your life uncomfortable. If you are reasonable, you view divorce as a measure of last resort. There are many steps you can take in the meantime. You might even call in a trained mediator.","The obligation to remember is inscribed on every Holocaust memorial, but even the words 'Never Forget' become irksome eventually.","There's a problem with narratives. Most that spring to mind are fictional.","Show me a university which is a hotbed of thin-skinned offence-taking, where every unacceptable idea is policed and every person who happens to hold one is hounded out of a job, and I will show you a university that isn't a university but an ideological prison camp and indoctrination centre.","Once in a while, we need the hard Left to pipe up.","When I was teaching at Cambridge, I sold handbags on the market.","You fall in love differently when you are young and far from home in a seductive place. You fall in love with the very air you breathe, and the vivid colours and the unbearably sweet sensation of distance and unaccustomedness.","I've been married three times. I married the girl next door when I was 22, and I wasn't a good husband, but I wasn't a good anything then. Nowadays, I'm much kinder.","Passionate dissent from the will of the multitude should be respected, not derided.","Sometimes, a writer's life alone can tell a story.","The young come in many guises: vigorous and passionate, vindictive and mean-spirited. And not every person over 65 is dozing in a retirement home.","I am enthralled until the last ball Djokovic hits, and the moment it is over and he is on his knees eating grass, I sink into my chair, cannot believe I have spent another fleeting fortnight of the few summers I have left caring about the outcome of contests I will have forgotten in the blink of an eye, and begin to question my sanity.","It is no judgement of a thing outside yourself to say it makes you ill. The wise reader knows that every pronouncement is, to some degree, an act of self-exposure; the book you find too challenging might only show how ill-equipped you are to face its challenge.","If something or someone is being banned, I want to be among the first to know about it.","When demagogues and dictators ban art, this is the reason: art is the great solvent of obedient fundamentalism.","It was reading Hamlet that ruined the concept of authenticity for me, not because Hamlet lacked existentialist credentials himself - indeed, as an earlier discontented Dane, he could be said to have laid the ground for Kierkegaard - but because the line 'to thine own self be true' was spoken by that humourless old ninny, Polonius.","People often think that you have a sense of humor because you think that life is funny. Life isn't funny at all. It's appalling and tragic.","When I first went to Israel, I saw soldiers pushing Palestinians around and thought, 'I can't stand this'. Then I'd meet somebody in a bar saying what wonderful people the Palestinians are and what mamzers the Jews are, and I'd think, 'Hang on'. It should be hard to make up your mind on any serious subject.","When I see ultra-Orthodox Jews stamping all over Jaffa, or when I see them deciding who is a Jew, I think: 'What's happened to the grand dream of Zionism?' I don't like to see ultra-Orthodox Jews in Israel. What's wrong with Manchester?","For me a Writing Day was an occasion for self-reproach and panic, a time to lament the passing of the years, stare out of windows and remember that even those famous late starters Joseph Conrad and George Eliot had started by the age I was now.","I should have conceived the idea for 'The Mighty Walzer' earlier. A boy who dreamed of winning fame, fortune, and the adoration of beautiful women as a table-tennis player - shame on me for taking so long to see the mock-heroic possibilities in that.","I was a 'reverence for life' man - 'see life steadily and see it whole' - in my days as a lecturer in English lit. We are, I argued, if not exactly 'saved' by reading, at least partially 'repaired' by it: made the better morally and existentially.","Things happen in 'If This is a Man' that are beyond ordinary daily experience, but it is still us to whom they are happening, and the understanding Levi seeks is no different in kind from that sought by Shakespeare in 'King Lear', or Conrad in 'The Heart of Darkness'.","Alone of prejudices, anti-Zionism is sacrosanct. How very dare we distinguish the motivation of one sort from another? Or question, in any instance, an anti-Zionist's good faith? In fact, what determines whether anti-Zionism is anti-Semitic is the nature of it.","When emotion rules, every fool thinks that he is holy.","Artless fairy stories enchant us in our first years and retain their hold on us until our last.","Non-conformity has always been one of the great British virtues, and that includes non-conformity to things British.","The terrorist isn't a problem because he doesn't conform; he's a problem because he does. It's what he conforms to that makes him dangerous.","For my own poor part, I go to great lengths to keep my nostrils sightly.","We shouldn't be too hard on vanity. It can be a mark of respect for the world.","The day I don't attend to my nostrils is the day I will have forsworn that world and become a different person. Someone otherwise preoccupied. Someone who couldn't care less what anyone thinks of his appearance - someone for whom the material life has lost its appeal.","You know you are grown sentimental when you start counting the cygnets on the duck pond in the park to be sure none has perished since you counted last.","Sentimentality works by our seeing only what we want to see.","Politically it's easy to salve one's conscience, no matter that salving it rarely makes the problem go away. You join the Labour Party, write articles attacking the privileged, give the money you spend on opera tickets to homeless charities, and vow never to go to anything that can be considered elitist again.","What isn't for everybody shouldn't be for anybody: the world's opera houses are the reasons we have cardboard cities.","The Christian Armenian story was the Polish Jewish story. The efforts of the Armenians to stay alive in Musa Dagh chimed with those struggling to survive the ghetto.","As a young man, I wooed, unsuccessfully, with Puccini. It's important to get your operas right.","The death of an Italian tailor might not be calamitous in Catania or Cagliari, but the loss to Soho is immeasurable. We don't have Italian tailors we can spare here.","There's a simple arithmetical logic at work. Build more unaffordable and not always architecturally sympathetic apartments, watch the rents rise, the tarts leave, the small shops, production offices and design studios close down, and hey presto, we have another fashionable London suburb indistinguishable from the rest.","Nostalgic myself, I am a sucker for other men's nostalgia.","It is against the spirit of our non-discriminating times to openly prefer one sort of music to another, so let's just say that hearing grand orchestral music in a public place is exhilarating in a way that hearing popular music never can be, if only because, in a popular music age, a full orchestra is less familiar to our ears.","To any young person starting out on life and looking to make a quick fortune, I have this advice: forget banking, but go instead into security, scaffolding, or urban trench digging. Not in a hands-on way. I mean start a company.","Certainly a curtain has never fallen too soon for me. Every play is too long, even the short ones. Every concert, every film, every television programme the same.","It's a law of our natures, especially when the political fit is on us, to applaud where we already approve, and deride where we don't.","It's not only teenagers who think they look good in pre-holed jeans, and I doubt it's only the superannuated who are amused by Ant and Dec.","Let discernment in matters of fashion and entertainment determine who should get the vote, and half the country would be disenfranchised.","Alarm bells ring when a politician stands haughty upon his honour.","Not every anti-Semite is Joseph Goebbels. You can not like Jews much and be no great harm to them.","The Stop The War Coalition is a sort of home to Jew-haters because its hate music about Israel is so catchy.","The environment in which I studied was so safe, I thought I would die from the boredom of it.","I had worked on the markets with my father before going to university, so I possessed an apparent street-smartness, had access to a colourful costermonger vocabulary, and tried passing myself off as a bit of spiv. But my contemporaries saw through me. At heart, they knew I was as bookish and oversensitive as they were.","Many a woman has suffered at the hands of a Paul Morel. There's more than one way of being brutal.","A writer should never allow himself to be lulled out of the vigilance native to his profession.","In anticipation of a meal - supposing we are with the ideal companion at the best table in the perfect restaurant - we might indeed postpone sadness. And maybe even halfway through, we will remain in tolerably high spirits, with dessert still to come. But as we near the end of eating, we begin to feel anticipatory twinges of anticlimax.","If it's bathos you want - and I suspect we are all bathos junkies in the end - nothing gives it to you quite like watching sport. Unless it's playing sport.","I recall waking to the realisation that I was the best table tennis player under 17 in north Manchester and parts of Bury. The satisfaction lasted for half an hour before I saw into the nothingness of things.","You don't have to be in pursuit of a body beautiful to wish yourself to be the flexuously willowy creature you once were or, failing that, just to be able to pick up something you have dropped.","I once belonged to a health club, where it cost me £2,000 a year to amble on a treadmill for half an hour a week and sit and read Grazia in the cooling-off area.","Looking back, I realise it wasn't only gym I dreaded at school. Every class was a torment. It wasn't knowledge I objected to but instruction. Why couldn't they just tell us what books to read and leave us to get on and read them?","You cannot exercise and be amused about it. You cannot integrate the dying bug into your core workout and hold to the position that you are a spiritual being. In this way, the body and the mind are each other's opposite unto death, which is why you have to choose which of them you are going to follow.","You don't have to believe the electorate secretly hankers for a dose of Marxist-Leninism to accept that there are deep levels of justified bitterness out there waiting to be tapped.","Maybe we'd forgotten what socialists are meant to look and sound like. Well, now we've been reminded. They're meant to look and sound like Jeremy Corbyn.","I like a singalong. And I'm a bit of a sentimentalist for the past myself.","Of the secular mysteries to which I wake with fresh and sometimes angry amazement every day, the queue is the second-most baffling. The first is the fan.","The queue and the fan are, of course, closely related in that fans will queue any length of time in any weather to see, touch, watch, hear, read, wear, or simply enjoy proximity to the object of their devotion.","There is a shop close to where I live, outside which, on certain nights of the month - I've no idea if the transit of the moon determines precisely when - fans of designer skateboards queue from early evening in order - well in order, I presume - to be among the first to jump on a skateboard when the shop opens in the morning.","There's a lot to be said for misanthropy.","This is now the way our culture prioritises. Look up 'Steppenwolf,' and you'll get the band before the novel. Look up Jesus Christ, and you'll get the musical. Look up Princess Link-a-din and you'll get LinkedIn, the business-oriented social network.","Sometimes it's best to speak from ignorance: that way, you can see the wood without being distracted by the trees.","Even the wordiest of men know there's a time to button it.","I once gave a character in a novel my inability to get past the same point in any work of philosophy: that moment when seeing is suddenly occluded and you know you can go no further.","To be clear, I abhor the separation wall. It is an eyesore in itself and makes tangible the failed diplomacy and cruel short-sightedness that causes such misery in the region. No Palestinian can see that wall and not wonder if the Israelis mean it to stay there forever, a constant reminder of what they never intend to change.","A book isn't noise to drown out other noise.","Nothing is more interesting in a novel or a play than an affair.","Box-set culture inclines to the hyperbolic.","Love is a brainworm.","I won't go so far as to say that novels sell in inverse proportion to their worth, for just occasionally, someone like Dickens or George Eliot comes along to prove the opposite.","If the great thing about the Internet is that it throws wide the doors of discussion to everyone, the bad thing about the Internet is that it throws wide the doors of discussion to everyone.","Does anyone who leaves a Baltic country ever want to return to it? Someone must, I suppose.","Homesickness is universal. But Neapolitan homesickness goes back further than the accidents of domicile. It is nostalgia for love and loss themselves, a soul-sickness caused by the very idea of leaving.","The more educated we are, the less we are prepared to tolerate views contrary to our own.","Shake any institution of higher learning, and a dozen boycotters will fall out of it.","If the academic community gets its way, we will soon all be speaking with a single voice.","It isn't only in the name of free speech that the views of an itchy polemicist should be tolerated - and I say itchy polemicist promoting thought, not itchy ideologue promoting violence - but because provocation is indispensable to the workings of a sound, creative culture.","If you want a good life, don't succeed at anything too early or too well. And don't choose a profession that attracts money or attention. The minute people want to see you doing what you do, you're finished.","Where there are no spectators, there is no sponsorship. Where there is no sponsorship, there is no money. Where there is no money, there are no officials with fingers in the pot. The lesson to be learnt from this is simple. If we want honest sport, we have to stop watching it.","Poets are not meant to be in competition.","Everything is susceptible to corruption of one sort or another - humanity is one big cheat - but it matters particularly with sport, which ceases to be itself the minute the outcome's rigged.","I am in denial about sport. I refuse to accept that I watch it. I am not the kind of man who watches sport.","I wouldn't dream of watching motor racing, cycling, or golf - which aren't truly sports anyway.","Among the many arguments to be made against cultural revolutions is that they are monotonous in spirit and monomaniacal in intention.","Most people to whom a statue has been erected are undeserving.","A healthy culture doesn't memorialise only those it agrees with.","That a nation's statuary will reflect beliefs and attitudes that are no longer current or congenial hardly needs arguing. In most instances, it doesn't at all imply a continuing reverence.","If we doubt the power of literature and art to civilise, how come no one has ever been mugged by a person carrying a well-thumbed copy of 'Middlemarch' in his back pocket?","Whoever has once been truly unsettled by a work of the imagination will never give loyalty to a single idea, belief system, religious faith or party.","You can imprison but you can't enslave a man who argues with his books.","A system of thought that accepts no inconsistencies is a frightful thing.","Whoever believes he knows why everything is as it is has hold of nothing.","There's no law that says you have to be consistent in your preferences.","I never believe any politician talking about popular culture.","Do you want to be strangely various, or do you want to be purely yourself? Either way, revere no one.","Don't imagine that a word you say is going to make a blind bit of difference.","Failing to see the point is not a virtue.","It is a nonsense to me when people come along and tell me not to be pessimistic; or that culture has always been going to the bad. Well, yes, it has, and it is an author's job to point it out.","'J' is a novel. A story about what it is like for people after a terrible event. And it is a love story, because I feel a novel is inevitably a love story.","Ideally, I would like everyone in the world to read and love my novels. In fact, I can't believe that everyone in the world doesn't love them. What is there not to love?","Sometimes I felt like my columns were like little novels in themselves. But I wasn't writing what I believed. I'm not interested in what I believe.","Every time I criticize the anti-Zionists, they say, 'You are trying to silence us.' I don't deny there are some people who are critical of Israel who are not anti-Semitic. But to criticize Israel, and then criticize Zionism, is not quite the same thing.","'Legality' is a mad phrase to use when it comes to the founding of nations. Australia was founded on illegality. For the Americans to go in and dispossess the American Indians was illegal.","One of the great things about us Jews is that we tell the best jokes. Part of the reason is we tell jokes against ourselves - before anyone else gets to do it.","I've always felt that desire. To get a woman to throw back her head in laughter is a hot thing.","The novels I planned to write were never going to be funny books about Jews. They were going to be country house books. Only later on could I write what I knew I was best at writing about.","Trump can be damned to all hell with his enclosed little world in which no thought is possible. But it's the encouraging of half the people of America and many more besides to hate words, hate what words can do, hate thought, hate the liberal, the sophisticated, the metropolitan. It's anger-making.","There mustn't be a moment when we turn on the TV and think, 'There's Trump in the White House' - that must never feel normal.","I wouldn't suppose for one moment that there's a single one of Trump's voters that would be anything but confirmed in their beliefs.","I think one of the main reasons I write is to do better than ranting. The ranting is the opinion, and the writing is not the opinion. I always say that people's opinions are the worst things about them. The words demand a dignity.","I've never owned a T-shirt. I don't like vests or sweaters or cardies with zips. I like a proper shirt with a collar. There's nothing else that I think I look nice in. I don't think there's anything else that other men look nice in, to be honest. Things with words on! Can you imagine? On grown-ups! Words are to make books with.","I've always said if a woman is looking for a good husband, she should go for a Jewish man past 60. Jewish men are essentially brought up to love women. Then you rebel against that and become a bit of a bastard. Then at 60, you revert.","One of my agents once said I was one of the most dangerous men in London, and I was so excited by that. For a few days, I walked around Soho snarling.","As soon as I finished 'The Finkler Question,' I was in despair. I'd changed my English publisher because they'd been lukewarm about it and not offered enough money. The American publisher didn't like it. The Canadian publisher didn't like it... I'd been bleeding readers since my first novel, and I could see my own career going down.","If you had to say in one sentence what being Jewish means, it is being able to make fun of yourself Jewishly.","I've always felt as much outside the Jewish experience as in it. It astonished my family that I wrote about things Jewish.","My mother's side taught me to be a little bit afraid of everything. For a long time, I was quiet and cautious. But shyness makes you notice other people's excruciations and feel for them. I think that made a writer of me.","As a Jew, I believe that every argument has a counterargument.","Nothing is definite, nothing is finished, nothing is determined.","I'm an old-fashioned English lit. man. Straight down the line - it's George Eliot, it's Dickens, it's Dr. Johnson, it's Jane Austen.","I was brought up a Jew but, you know, that way of being Jewish - the New York way. We were stomach Jews; we were Jewish-joke Jews. We were bagel Jews. We didn't go to synagogue. I'm frightened of synagogue to this day.","I normally take a long time finding titles. I finish the book and go into sweats for months afterwards trying to think of them.","People keep saying you can't satirize Trump because he's beyond satire, but it's not difficult to just let him out and let him walk upon the stage and say his own words.","Making America great again, as if to keep the world out. The world and all its fresh ideas and everything that's new and exhilarating and the wind of change that should blow through the world - block it out, wall ourselves up. That for me goes with a small vocabulary. A narrow, confining vocabulary.","Nobody who's thought about politics or democracy over the thousands of years that people have been thinking about democracy hasn't come up against the fact that the people will often be wrong. And what do you do when they are? You can't just say, 'Well, it's the will of the people.'","In my experience, every book you write changes the conditions in which you write the next.","I would rise, monk-like, at 6 A.M., speak to no one, make tea, and go immediately to my desk from which I didn't move until frills appeared around the edges of my eyes or I heard the sound of a wine bottle being uncorked. It would give the wrong impression to describe these as Writing Days.","When people speak to me of the torment of writing, I can think only of what it was like before I wrote: once writing meant writing and not thinking about writing, I knew nothing of any torment.","I have made of Sydney, to which I sailed in 1965, a paradise beyond the powers of fancy.","I was young; I was newly married. My Cambridge degree was still warm in my pocket - a roll of parchment guaranteeing me, I thought, a sort of free ambassadorial passage to any campus of my choosing, and I had chosen Sydney - the world was all before me.","It is good for a person who has suffered from acute shyness, as I had, to find that he can cause as much upset as he suffered. Better to be a brute, I thought, than to be a wallflower.","Trump's hobbled vocabulary is now the incontestable stuff of comedy: not just how few his words but how narrow their range, from boastful to irked and back again. For satirists and impressionists, a president who addresses the American people in abbreviated tweetspeak is a gift.","How Donald Trump has come so far with so few words - how he even managed to keep up conversationally with all those beauty queens - is a question I don't expect ever to be solved.","The 'Reader's Digest' used to run a feature called 'It Pays to Increase Your Word Power.' The new wisdom - post-Trump and Brexit - is that it doesn't.","Words do not necessarily make us moral. And there have been presidents before who have stumbled over syntax and looked foolish when the words they have been forced to speak have been their own. But Trump is uniquely stunted. A child listening to two of his speeches could reproduce a third without the use of a dictionary.","One should take writers' valuations of their own work with a pinch of salt: they are likely to rank them differently tomorrow.","Although, from the point of view of sociology, the overt ambition of 'American Pastoral' - to imagine the impact on a good man of America's fall from the family decencies of the '30s and '40s to the self-centred violence of the '60s - outstrips anything Sabbath's Theater attempts, the writing is no less fervid an excurse into the writer's mind.","I find Australia compelling and vexatious at the best of times; I've never been able to get it out of my system since going there as a young lecturer, and yet however much I love revisiting it, I always feel I have to leave again.","A novel is not a play. A novel takes one reader at a time into its confidence. It can be shockingly personal. Private, even.","You can have your country and be pleased to welcome others to it. You can have your country and still enjoy living elsewhere.","Things go bad after a divorce and often stay that way. It is rare for the parties to return placidly to a time before they met. A bitterness lingers on. Those who call this our Independence Day, fantasising of returning to a never-never time before they married, when they were free, easy, single, and master of their fate, are delusional.","Not everyone is fortunate enough to earn their living playing. But what draws people to art and artists is a desire to enjoy the propinquity of play. For it is the very freedom of the imagination. And what else were we born to do, but imagine freely?","Think of the aged and bed-ridden Matisse cutting out strips of coloured paper, much as a child might, and investing them with a more than mortal vitality... Those strips of paper resonate because they prove that our materials don't determine in advance the worth of what we make.","Rereading one's own novels after many years is always a fraught business, but when a novel has fallen out of print - 'The Very Model of a Man' is the only novel of mine that has - and so crops up infrequently in conversations with readers or indeed with oneself, revisiting it can be perilous.","Many a trivial novel has been written about an important subject, and many a profound one about nothing in particular.","Literature more often tells the story of impulses we don't act on than of ones we do. I could joke about the Cain and Abel story with my brother without expecting him to be worried, though it's always possible he was more anxious than he let on.","Our connection to the great myths of our natures is murky. A mother might see the Medea in herself without imagining she will ever do away with her children.","To assert that antisemitism is unlike other racisms is not to claim a privilege for it. Hating a Jew is no worse than hating anyone else.","To a philosopher like Nietzsche, the Jew is culpable not for rejecting Christianity but for inventing it.","If the Jew transmogrified into the Devil for the medieval church, he retained his devilish characteristics as Christian sentiment found other places to express itself, early socialism being one of them.","The presence of a Jew in any movement no more guarantees it to be innocent of antisemitism than guilty. And that applies to anti-Zionism, too. Anti-Zionist Jews exist, but that tells one nothing about anti-Zionism.","Literature is a house with many mansions.","'Great Expectations', in short, is a more damning account of the mess Dickens himself had made of love than any denunciation on behalf of the outraged wives club could ever be.","As for 'Great Expectations', it is up there for me with the world's greatest novels, not least as it vindicates plot as no other novel I can think of does, since what there is to find out is not coincidence or happenstance but the profoundest moral truth.","Reading literature remains a civilising activity, no matter that it's literature in which people do and say abominable things and the author curses like the very devil. What's at issue is how we describe the way the civilising works.","If we declare ourselves, as readers, to be on the side of life, the question has to be asked what sort of life we are on the side of.","No good writer ever merely cheered us up. But there's an unblinking stare into the darkness of things we have to go elsewhere to find. Jane Austen was made of strong stuff. She was too satiric for D. H. Lawrence's taste and too unforgiving for Kingsley Amis's, but you would still not call her hellish.","Again and again, Primo Levi's work is described as indispensable, essential, necessary. None of those terms overstate the case, but they do prepare readers new to Levi for a forbiddingly educative experience, making him a writer unlike all others and the experience of reading him a chore. Which it isn't.","There is much that makes one pause in 'If This is a Man', the record of Levi's 11-month incarceration in Auschwitz, much one cannot read without needing to lay aside the book and inhale the breath of common air.","Show me a novel that's not comic, and I'll show you a novel that's not doing its job.","To my ear, the term 'comic novelist' is as redundant and off-putting as the term 'literary novelist'.","The liveliest effusions of wit and humour are simply what the reader of a novel has a right to expect.","Trawl through the world of blogs and tweets, and you will find readers complaining when they stumble upon a word they don't recognise, an attitude that doesn't accord with their own, a passage of thought they find hard work, a joke they don't get or of which they don't approve.","For a lot of readers these days, a book is something you have to agree or disagree with. But you can't agree with a novel. For my generation, it was assumed that a book is a dramatic thing, that the eye of the book is not telling you what to think.","With 'J', at a deep base level, there is still some comedy, but that masculinist voice that had driven so many of my novels I suddenly did not want to occupy. I wasn't reneging on it; I just didn't want to do it.","The novel is a thing of irony and ambiguity. That's at the heart of 'J', a world that has stopped arguing with itself. We have to keep our equilibrium of hate, which is argument. But on the Internet, you find a unanimity of response, and in 'J,' there's a fear of that, that discourse becomes a statement of political or ideological belief.","You are changed by the people you are closest to, and this has allowed me to forgive myself for the person I once was.","'Family Guy'. It's not only the funniest programme on television, it's the most wonderfully, indecorously literate.","The painter Sidney Nolan once told me I tried too hard. Advice I've been trying hard to follow ever since.","It's always nice to be praised, and insofar as a prize is a form of praise, you're glad when you get it.","There was no question of ever sending us to Jewish schools... They wanted us out there. They wanted us to be lawyers and doctors. They wanted us out of the religious thing, apart from that ethnic bonding.","I always, always wanted to be a writer.","That's the great test: if you're going to be a great comic writer, not a humorist, you've got to take it into the throat of grief. Can you make laughter and seriousness so close that they are the same thing?","The magic word 'Shakespeare' always freezes you in your chair.","I have a son, but I've never had a daughter. I have a sister, and my sister had a fairly tempestuous relationship with my dad when she was young, and that was gripping and sometimes upsetting.","Shakespeare's always been sitting on my back, since I began reading. And, certainly, as a writer, he's who I hear all the time. And he's almost indistinguishable now from the English language. I have no sense of what Shakespeare is like. I have no sense of the personality that is Shakespeare. I think, alone among writers, I don't know who he is.","I hear Shakespeare, sometimes, the way other people might hear God or Marx or something. But he's so different from that."],"Howard K. Smith":["They said it was against the rules to take sides on a controversial issue. I said, 'I wish you had told me that during World War II, when I took sides against Hitler.'","For an Italian peasant a telegram from anywhere is a wondrous thing; and a cable from the terrestrial paradise of America is not lightly to be disregarded."],"Howard Keel":["As long as I can sing halfway decent, I'd rather sing than act. There's nothing like being in good voice, feeling good, having good numbers to do and having a fine orchestra.","The only way to enjoy golf is to be a masochist. Go out and beat yourself to death.","It was a fine cast and lots of fun to make, but they did the damn thing on the cheap. The backdrops had holes in them, and it was shot on the worst film stock.","Wherever I went, crowds appeared again, and I started making solo albums for the first time in my career."],"Howard Kurtz":["It's a brave new world.","Journalism seems to have recovered its reason for being."],"Howard Lindsay":["I shall give you hunger, and pain, and sleepless nights. Also beauty, and satisfactions known to few, and glimpses of the heavenly life. None of these you shall have continually, and of their coming and going you shall not be foretold.","Every so often, we pass laws repealing human nature."],"Howard Lutnick":["It's the details that make people distinct, that make them individuals.","I believe in what I call 'the surfer's theory.' You see a really, really big wave. You keep surfing, keep going forward. You just don't look back.","I worked during summers on the foreign exchange desk as a dollar/yen broker for Noonan, Astley & Pierce. I used to write the chairman notes about how he could improve his business. And I met Bernie Cantor through this job.","Anything commodity-like will be sold online. The world is going to trade commodities like it trades stocks.","In 1997, clients balked at self-ordering. They thought it was beneath them. But in 1998, a sea change in perception came, thanks to the rise of the Net and online trading. The concept of doing it yourself was not crazy.","In this business, technology is life or death.","Haverford was there for me and taught me what it meant to be a human being.","Without parents, you sort of lose the gravity that keeps your feet on the earth.","With management and employees on the same side of the table, your interests are aligned, and shareholders look at you as one.","People don't value strongly enough how much time they spend in the office. Imagine you could work with people you love - wouldn't work be great and staff turnover be lower? And your productivity higher?","You have to give people more than one chance. We hire people in job A, and if it doesn't work out, we try them on job B. We'll generally give them three different tries. You have to be more committed to training, but you know they have the right stuff because someone you think highly of has recommended them.","Washington is not the engine of the economy.","The people in Washington spend too much time in Washington, so they think Washington-centric thoughts.","New York is a spectacular place, and those who are jealous of the way we live our lives are always going to, you know, to strike out, and, you know, we're always going to be a target, sadly. London is going to be a target. You know, anywhere in the West, you're a target.","Personally, I find it odd that they would name it One World Trade Center. Frankly, I think if they named it any company name, I would think it was - you know, the memorial is beautiful, but I don't know why they don't change the name. That just seems so odd to me.","The combination of Cantor and eSpeed will earn more money and be more profitable than we ever were before September 11.","The Cantor reputation is one we get from clients and those we hire.","Our whole lives, did any of us actually think a quarter of a percent was actually an interest rate?","After Hurricane Sandy, we adopted 19 elementary schools in tough neighborhoods. We took each kid in those schools and gave the family a prepaid Visa card.","The World Trade Center was the target for the world, and they hit the target.","The best way to show someone you love them is to care for the people they love.","My goal after 9/11 was to take care of the families of the people we lost, and that was the most important thing.","The idea that big buyside firms are going to come in and trade mano-a-mano with high-frequency trading firms shows a lack of knowledge of the business.","Data drives success. That is how we began our success with eSpeed. It was always based on the data.","People looked to rating agencies to do the work for them.","eSpeed took the worst that the world could dish out, and it still stood and performed.","It's hard for bad things to happen when you have no debt.","Dead-low interest rates are great for stocks. They don't run up, they creep up.","I have great kids and family.","What people really haven't thought about with real estate is, if you get tax reform, you're going to see real estate now... the velocity of selling and buying real estate will just kick.","When you take away all the people whose shoulders a CEO stands on, the CEO is just a person.","I would blast AC/DC and walk out onto the tennis court and try to hit the ball hard.","Athletics weren't really in the cards in my family - books, not body.","The only reason to have money is to share it with your friends and have fun.","For us to be successful, we have to kick our competitors' butt.","You can't make promises you can't keep.","If people say I paid someone more because I liked them, okay. I don't think that's a bad thing."],"Howard Mumford Jones":["I, for one, hope that youth will again revolt and again demoralize the dead weight of conformity that now lies upon us.","Emerson was the chief figure in the American transcendental movement, a fact that complicates all accounts of him in literary or cultural history.","When he died, Emerson was thought of as the representative American writer par excellence, and his point of view was still so potent that William James was honored to be asked to speak at a centenary celebration.","Emerson then incarnated the moral optimism, the progress, and the energy of the American spirit.","Persecution is the first law of society because it is always easier to suppress criticism than to meet it."],"Howard Nemerov":["The secrets of success are a good wife and a steady job. My wife told me.","For a Jewish Puritan of the middle class, the novel is serious, the novel is work, the novel is conscientious application why, the novel is practically the retail business all over again.","A teacher is a person who never says anything once.","Nothing in the universe can travel at the speed of light, they say, forgetful of the shadow's speed.","A chronicle is very different from history proper.","I liked the kid who wrote me that he had to do a term paper on a modern poet and he was doing me because, though they say you have to read poems twice, he found he could handle mine in one try.","It may be said that poems are in one way like icebergs: only about a third of their bulk appears above the surface of the page.","A lot happens by accident in poetry.","History is one of those marvelous and necessary illusions we have to deal with. It's one of the ways of dealing with our world with impossible generalities which we couldn't live without.","I am not at all clear what free verse is anymore. That's one of the things you learn not to know.","I do insist on making what I hope is sense so there's always a coherent narrative or argument that the reader can follow.","I have a plot, but not much happens.","I like all my children, even the squat and ugly ones.","I never abandoned either forms or freedom. I imagine that most of what could be called free verse is in my first book. I got through that fairly early.","I sometimes talk about the making of a poem within the poem.","I think there was a revolution in poetry, associated chiefly with Eliot and Pound; but maybe it is of the nature of revolutions or of the nature of history that their innovations should later come to look trivial or indistinguishable from technical tricks.","I think there's one thing which distinguishes our art - we don't consider. We don't think. We write a little verse because it comes to us.","I would talk in iambic pentameter if it were easier.","I've thought of the last line of some poems for years and tried them out, It wouldn't work because the last line was much too beautiful for the poem.","Language cares.","Language is remarkable, except under the extreme constraints of mathematics and logic, it never can talk only about what it's supposed to talk about but is always spreading around.","Mostly the thought and the verse come inseparably. In my poem Poetics, it's as close as I come to telling how I do it.","Occasionally a student writer comes up with something really beautiful and moving, and you won't know for years if it was an accident or the first burst of something wonderful.","Once in awhile you have a thought, and you rhyme it.","Robert Frost had always said you mustn't think of the last line first, or it's only a fake poem, not a real one. I'm inclined to agree.","Shakespeare tells the same stories over and over in so many guises that it takes a long time before you notice.","The historian is terribly responsible to what he can discern are the facts of the case, but he's nothing if he doesn't make out a case.","The nice thing about the Bible is it doesn't give you too many facts. Two an a half lines and it tells you the whole story and that leaves you a great deal of freedom to elaborate on how it might have happened.","The spirit world doesn't admit to communicating with me, so it's fairly even.","We're not in love with Literature all the time - especially when you have to teach it every day.","When I was starting to write, the great influence was T.S. Eliot and after that William Butler Yeats.","When modern writers gave up telling stories, they gave up the greatest thing we had.","When Robert Frost was alive, I was known as the other new England poet, which is to be barely known at all.","When you write it doesn't occur to you that somebody could think different from what you do.","Write what you know. That should leave you with a lot of free time.","I've never read a political poem that's accomplished anything. Poetry makes things happen, but rarely what the poet wants.","Obvious enough that generalities work to protect the mind from the great outdoors; is it possible that this was in fact their first purpose?"],"Howard Rheingold":["You can't have an industrial revolution, you can't have democracies, you can't have populations who can govern themselves until you have literacy. The printing press simply unlocked literacy.","There is never going to be a substitute for face-to-face communication, but we have seen since the alphabet, to the telephone and now the Internet, that whenever people find a new way to communicate, they will flock to it.","You can't assume any place you go is private because the means of surveillance are becoming so affordable and so invisible.","Openness and participation are antidotes to surveillance and control.","Until fairly recently, Amish teachers would reprimand the student who raised his or her hand as being too individualistic. Calling attention to oneself, or being 'prideful,' is one of the cardinal Amish worries. Having your name or photo in the papers, even talking to the press, is almost a sin.","I've spent my life alone in a room with a typewriter.","Its not a global village, but we're in a highly interconnected globe.","I want to be very careful about judging and how much to generalize about the use of media being pathological. For some people, it's a temptation and a pathology; for others, it's a lifeline.","Mindfulness means being aware of how you're deploying your attention and making decisions about it, and not letting the tweet or the buzzing of your BlackBerry call your attention.","Markets are as old as the crossroads. But capitalism, as we know it, is only a few hundred years old, enabled by cooperative arrangements and technologies, such as the joint-stock ownership company, shared liability insurance, double-entry bookkeeping.","Technology no longer consists just of hardware or software or even services, but of communities. Increasingly, community is a part of technology, a driver of technology, and an emergent effect of technology.","A forecasting game is a kind of simulation, a kind of scenario, a kind of teleconference, a kind of artifact from the future - and more - that enlists the participants as 'first-person forecasters.'","People's social networks do not consist only of people they see face to face. In fact, social networks have been extending because of artificial media since the printing press and the telephone.","People's behavior will change with technology. I know very few young people who can't type out a text message on their phone with one thumb, for instance.","The more material there is, the more need there is for filters. You don't need a printing press anymore, but you do need people who know how to cultivate sources, double-check information and put the brand of legitimacy on it.","We are moving rapidly into a world in which the spying machinery is built into every object we encounter.","Any virtual community that works, works because people put in some time.","People move from place to place and job to job, but they no longer need to lose touch.","Kids automatically teach each other how to use technology, but they're not going to teach each other about the history of democracy, or the importance of taking their voices into the public sphere to create social change.","When designers replaced the command line interface with the graphical user interface, billions of people who are not programmers could make use of computer technology.","Schoolchildren are not taught how to distinguish accurate information from inaccurate information online - surely there are ways to design web-browsers to help with this task and ways to teach young people how to use the powerful online tools available to them.","Attention is the fundamental instrument we use for learning, thinking, communicating, deciding, yet neither parents nor schools spend any time helping young people learn how to manage information streams and control the ways they deploy their attention.","The two parts of technology that lower the threshold for activism and technology is the Internet and the mobile phone. Anyone who has a cause can now mobilize very quickly.","Mobile communications and pervasive computing technologies, together with social contracts that were never possible before, are already beginning to change the way people meet, mate, work, war, buy, sell, govern and create.","Although we leave traces of our personal lives with our credit cards and Web browsers today, tomorrow's mobile devices will broadcast clouds of personal data to invisible monitors all around us.","One thing we didn't know in 1996 is that it's very, very difficult, if not impossible, to sustain a culture with online advertising.","Whenever a technology enables people to organize at a pace that wasn't before possible, new kinds of politics emerge.","Soon the digital divide will not be between the haves and the have-nots. It will be between the know-hows and the non-know-hows.","A lot of people use collaborative technologies badly, then abandon them. They aren't 'plug-and-play.' The invisible part is the social skill necessary to use them.","By the time you get a job, you know how to behave in a meeting or how to write a simple memo.","We like technology because we don't have to talk to anybody.","I think e-mail petitions are an illusion. It gives people the illusion that they're participating in some meaningful political action.","We think of them as mobile phones, but the personal computer, mobile phone and the Internet are merging into some new medium like the personal computer in the 1980s or the Internet in the 1990s.","It's kind of astonishing that people trust strangers because of words they write on computer screens.","The AP has only so many reporters, and CNN only has so many cameras, but we've got a world full of people with digital cameras and Internet access.","There is an elementary level of trust that is necessary for community. You have to be able to trust that your neighbors aren't going to look into your mailbox.","On the Internet, it is assumed people are in business to sell out, not to build something they can pass along to their grandkids.","Advertising in the past has been predicated on a mass market and a captive audience.","Young voters are crucial. The trend over recent years has been for them to drift away. So anything that gets young voters interested in the electoral process not only has an immediate effect, but has an effect for years and years.","There's a direct relationship between how difficult it is to send a message and how strongly it is received.","The Chinese government tried to keep a lid on the SARS crisis, but there were 160 million text messages in three days sent by Chinese citizens. These are early indications that it's going to be difficult for people who used to have control over the news to maintain that level of control.","It's more important to me to get an e-mail that says, 'I saw your page and it changed my life,' than how many hits the page got.","Craigslist is about authenticity. Craig has paid his dues, and people respect him.","You can't pick up the telephone and say, 'Connect me with someone else who has a kid with leukemia.'","The Orwellian vision was about state-sponsored surveillance. Now it's not just the state, it's your nosy neighbor, your ex-spouse and people who want to spam you.","The idea that your spouse or your parents don't know where you are at all times may be part of the past. Is that good or bad? Will that make for better marriages or worse marriages? I don't know.","Humans have lived for much, much longer than the approximately 10,000 years of settled agricultural civilization.","Of course, with agriculture came the first big civilizations, the first cities built of mud and brick, the first empires. And it was the administers of these empires who began hiring people to keep track of the wheat and sheep and wine that was owed and the taxes that was owed on them by making marks; marks on clay in that time.","Open source production has shown us that world-class software, like Linux and Mozilla, can be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm nor the incentives of the marketplace as we've known them.","People look at me, and I dress a little unusually and they think, 'Oh you must be from California.' Of course, people in California think, 'Oh you must be from from Mars,' so, you know, your next-door neighbour is not necessarily the person that you are going to make a connection with.","Inexpensive phones and pay-as-you go services are already spreading mobile phone technology to many parts of that world that never had a wired infrastructure.","Some digital natives are extraordinarily savvy.","Journalists don't have audiences - they have publics who can respond instantly and globally, positively or negatively, with a great deal more power than the traditional letters to the editor could wield.","A phone tree isn't an ancient form of political organizing, but you have to call every person.","I think there are two aspects to smart environments. One is information embedded in places and things. The other is location awareness, so that devices we carry around know where we are. When you combine those two, you get a lot of possibilities.","It used to be that if your automobile broke, the teenager down the street with the wrench could fix it. Now you have to have sophisticated equipment that can deal with microchips. We're entering a world in which the complexity of the devices and the system of interconnecting devices is beyond our capability to easily understand.","We already know that spam is a huge downside of online life. If we're going to be spammed on our telephones wherever we go, I think we're going to reject these devices.","Communicating online goes back to the Defense Department's Arpanet which started in 1969. There was something called Usenet that started in 1980, and this gave people an opportunity to talk about things that people on these more official networks didn't talk about.","Any disease support community is a place of deep bonds and empathy, and there are thousands if not tens of thousands of them.","Some critics argue that a tsunami of hogwash has already rendered the Web useless. I disagree. We are indeed inundated by online noise pollution, but the problem is soluble.","Entire books are being written about the distractions of social media. I don't believe media compel distraction, but I think it's clear that they afford it.","Humans are humans because we are able to communicate with each other and to organize to do things together that we can't do individually.","I'm somebody who seems to stumble into things 10 or 20 years before the rest of the world does.","Flash mobbing may be a fad that passes away, or it may be an indicator of things to come.","Democracy is not just voting for your leaders; it's really premised upon ordinary citizens understanding the issues.","Personal computers were created by some teenagers in garages because the, the wisdom of the computer industry was that people didn't want these little toys on their desk.","Technology is my native tongue. I'm online six hours a day.","The Amish communities of Pennsylvania, despite the retro image of horse-drawn buggies and straw hats, have long been engaged in a productive debate about the consequences of technology.","Like most modern Americans, I assume individuality is not only a fundamental value, but a goal in life, an art form.","Technologies evolve in the strangest ways. Computers were created to calculate ballistics equations, and now we use them to create amusing illusions. Creating amusing illusions is a big business if you play it right.","Unlike with the majority of library books, when you enter a term into a search engine there is no guarantee that what you will find is authoritative, accurate or even vaguely true.","As for Twitter, I've found that you have to learn how to make it add value rather than subtract hours from one's day. Certainly, it affords narcissism and distraction.","What person doesn't search online about their disease after they are diagnosed?"],"Howard Schultz":["When you're surrounded by people who share a passionate commitment around a common purpose, anything is possible.","Starbucks represents something beyond a cup of coffee.","I can't imagine a day without coffee. I can't imagine!","I think the currency of leadership is transparency. You've got to be truthful. I don't think you should be vulnerable every day, but there are moments where you've got to share your soul and conscience with people and show them who you are, and not be afraid of it.","Starbucks has a role and a meaningful relationship with people that is not only about the coffee.","Starbucks is not an advertiser; people think we are a great marketing company, but in fact we spend very little money on marketing and more money on training our people than advertising.","Companies should not have a singular view of profitability. There needs to be a balance between commerce and social responsibility... The companies that are authentic about it will wind up as the companies that make more money.","Success is best when it's shared.","Great companies that build an enduring brand have an emotional relationship with customers that has no barrier. And that emotional relationship is on the most important characteristic, which is trust.","In life, you can blame a lot of people and you can wallow in self-pity, or you can pick yourself up and say, 'Listen, I have to be responsible for myself.'","It's ironic that no matter where I go, I meet people from Brooklyn. I'm proud of that heritage. It's where I'm from, who I am.","You can't build any kind of organization if you're not going to surround yourself with people who have experience and skill base beyond your own.","I think if you're an entrepreneur, you've got to dream big and then dream bigger.","Everyone must have a shot at the American Dream.","In many places where coffee is grown, deforestation is a major issue.","Starbucks has stores in America in many, many communities that are governed by many, many different municipalities. Starbucks cannot dictate to a municipality in Cincinnati or Kansas City or Sacramento how or why or when there should be a recycling program.","Anybody can leverage celebrity for profit.","We must restore the emotional relationship that people have to the idea of America, that no matter where you come from, no matter where you live, that you have access to the same opportunities that somebody who is born in privilege.","When it comes to Starbucks, I take every threat very personally.","You walk into a retail store, whatever it is, and if there's a sense of entertainment and excitement and electricity, you wanna be there.","I never wanted to be on any billionaires list. I never define myself by net worth. I always try to define myself by my values.","We think of Starbucks not as a coffee company but a media company.","Do I take criticism of Starbucks personally? Of course I do.","The challenge of the retail business is the human condition.","On balance, I am a supporter of the minimum wage going up. We've got to be very careful what we wish for because some employers - and there could be a lot of them - will be scared away from hiring new people or creating incremental hours for part-time people as a result of that wage going up.","I'm not losing any sleep over Dunkin Donuts.","I am concerned about any attrition in customer traffic at Starbucks, but I don't want to use the economy, commodity prices or consumer confidence as an excuse. We must maintain a value proposition to our customers as well as differentiate the Starbucks Experience. That is the key.","I believe life is a series of near misses. A lot of what we ascribe to luck is not luck at all. It's seizing the day and accepting responsibility for your future. It's seeing what other people don't see And pursuing that vision.","The hardest thing about being a leader is demonstrating or showing vulnerability... When the leader demonstrates vulnerability and sensibility and brings people together, the team wins.","Profitability is a shallow goal if it doesn't have a real purpose, and the purpose has to be share the profits with others.","Certainly the caffeine in coffee, whether it's Starbucks or generic coffee, is somewhat of a stimulant. But if you drink it in moderation, which I think four or five cups a day is, you're fine.","I was taken by the power that savoring a simple cup of coffee can have to connect people and create community.","Any business today that embraces the status quo as an operating principle is going to be on a death march.","If you don't love what you're doing with unbridled passion and enthusiasm, you're not going to succeed when you hit obstacles.","Expect more than others think possible.","The future of America is not an entitlement. We have been given a treasure chest of gifts and opportunities, but some people are being left behind, and success is not sustainable unless it is shared.","If Vancouver did not succeed as Starbucks from '87 on, our entire international business, which is now thousands of stores and a significant amount of growth and profit, may not have existed.","Business leaders cannot be bystanders.","Managing a business, small or large, today requires an extremely disciplined, thoughtful approach with regard to the pressure that people are under.","Don't buy preground coffee.","We can't wait for Washington. Business leaders are going to have to galvanize their own constituencies and do everything they can to demonstrate confidence in the economy, and I think that can be contagious.","My biggest concern is that America is drifting towards mediocrity and that people don't recognize - and by people I'm meaning Washington - don't recognize the sense of urgency and the fact that I don't think this is a crisis anymore. I think it's an emergency.","I think there is probably no better person to aspire to emulate than Steve Jobs and what he has done at Apple in terms of his leadership, his innovation, not settling for mediocrity.","Often, organizations need bold, grand gestures to galvanize people towards a new mission or refocus their attention.","Pouring espresso is an art, one that requires the barista to care about the quality of the beverage.","I'm a voracious reader.","I do think - as self-serving as it sounds - that I was the right person, given the very, very strong headwind we had from the economy and our own issues, to come back and rewrite the future of the company.","Cutting prices or putting things on sale is not sustainable business strategy.","Europe has always represented a major strategic opportunity to achieve our goal of creating and building an enduring global brand.","People around the world, they want the authentic Starbucks experience.","I think people will walk into the Starbucks store and overnight recognize the significant difference between what Starbucks represents day-in and day-out and all the other coffee companies that have been serving coffee in India for so many years.","I was born on the other side of the tracks, in public housing in Brooklyn, New York. My dad never made more than $20,000 a year, and I grew up in a family that lost health insurance. So I was scarred at a young age with understanding what it was like to watch my parents lose access to the American dream.","Care more than others think wise.","Dream more than others think practical.","Starbucks has changed the rules of engagement for the music industry.","With a population of more than 600 million people, an emerging middle class that is driving strong consumption, and a robust and resilient economy, Southeast Asia presents a compelling growth opportunity for Starbucks.","We are witnessing a seismic change in consumer behavior. That change is being brought about by technology and the access people have to information.","The Starbucks customer and the Teavana customer are two very different customers, two different need states that are highly complimentary.","Many companies today are reducing hours of full-time people to get under the minimum so they don't have to pay health care costs. I just shake my head because that's not going to build long-term value and trust with your people.","Starbucks is in my blood. It is such a part of me that letting it unravel simply was not an option.","I despise research. I think it's a crutch.","I love being the underdog.","Managing and navigating through a financial crisis is no fun at all.","I think growth covers up mistakes.","I tried to build a company my father would have been proud to work for, that he would have looked back on and said, 'That's the company that honoured me, even though I don't have an education'. I wanted to build a company that had a conscience.","Risk more than others think safe.","China traditionally has been a tea-drinking country but we turned them into coffee drinkers.","Success in the United States is not an entitlement in China. You have to go there and earn it, and earn it the right way.","We have a big opportunity in China. We think the number of stores here can rival the number in North America.","London, a city where creativity and innovation have always flourished, provides a significant home for Starbucks and a significant gateway into Europe.","My parents really wanted me to get out of New York, be exposed to other people, other ways of life.","I always saw myself wanting to do something deemed successful and good at the same time.","As Americans, there are very few things we have confidence in.","I probably have about four or five cups of coffee a day. I make myself an espresso macchiato when I wake, which is a shot of espresso and just a dollop of steamed milk. Then, if I'm going to do some work at home, I would make myself a French press. It's the best way to make conventional coffee.","My father had a series of blue-collar jobs and never made more than $20,000 a year. When I was seven, he got injured on a job. That was a very important point - because of the injury, he couldn't walk, and the company he was working for did not pay him. There was no compensation. So there was no money and no food.","A great business has to have a conscience. You have to know who you are and who you are not.","California, in a sense, is almost Starbucks' largest country, with almost 3,000 stores.","I think my whole life, because of where I came from, I had a fear of failure.","Starbucks is committed to evolving and enhancing our customer experience with innovative and wholesome food offerings.","The evolving social and digital media platforms and highly innovative and relevant payment capabilities are causing seismic changes in consumer behavior and creating equally disruptive opportunities for business.","Growing up I always felt like I was living on the other side of the tracks. I knew the people on the other side had more resources, more money, happier families.","In the 1960s, if you were a blue collar worker or uneducated, and you had an injury on the job, the company basically dismissed you.","The premium single-cup segment is the fastest-growing business within the global coffee industry.","Social and digital media is a bullet train, and that bullet train is not coming home.","I'm much more concerned about America than the Democratic Party.","When you start a company, it's a singular focus. You have the wind at your back.","In the 1960s, if you introduced a new product to America, 90% of the people who viewed it for the first time believed in the corporate promise. Then 40 years later if you performed the same exercise, less than 10% of the public believed it was true. The fracturing of trust is based on the fact that the consumer has been let down.","I think we are living in a time where the consumer has lots of choices, whether it's coffee, newspapers or whatever it is. And there is parity in the market place, and as a result of that, the consumer is beginning to make decisions, not just on what things cost and the convenience of it.","Most business people today are not going to invest in the uncertainty that exists in America.","I'm optimistic about the country; I'm optimistic about the American people.","America's leaders need to put their feet in the shoes of working Americans.","The lifeblood of job creation in America is small business, but they can't get access to credit.","We sell tea in Starbucks, but I think the experience is very different. I think coffee is something that is quick - it's transactional. I think tea is more Zen-like. It requires a different environment.","What I would say to young entrepreneurs is there's so many moments in your life where you have these dreams, and people are trying to protect you, and they say, perhaps, friends, family, parents sometimes, they don't agree with it, they think, 'This is just too high of a hurdle.' And I don't agree with that.","I really believe that you cannot use the stock market as a proxy for the economy.","When you're building a business or joining a company, you have to be transparent; you can't have two sets of information for two sets of people.","I am concerned about any attrition in customer traffic at Starbucks, but I don't want to use the economy, commodity prices or consumer confidence as an excuse.","Great opportunities can be and have been created during tough economic times.","Cutting prices or putting things on sale is not sustainable business strategy. The other side of it is that you can't cut enough costs to save your way to prosperity.","Americans reading the paper, listening to the news every single day, and all you hear is things are getting worse and worse. And that has a psychological effect on consumer confidence. That's what consumer confidence is.","My kids probably started drinking coffee in their late teens.","People have come to me over the years and said to me: 'I admire the culture of Starbucks. Can you come give a speech and help us turn our culture around?' I wish it were that easy. Turning a culture around is very difficult to do because it's based on a series of many, many decisions, and the organization is framed by those decisions.","I think many start-ups make mistakes because they are focusing on things that are farther ahead, and they haven't done the work that has built the foundation to support it.","I was working probably at the age of 10, when I had my first paper route. I had every different kind of job you could possibly imagine as a young kid.","I'm in a different position than most CEO's. I'm a founder. I'm not a hired CEO. Now, I can be fired by the board, but most CEO's are hired by the board.","I think what we're lacking in society, not only in the U.S. but also around the world, is to find heroes once again and to celebrate these kind of people.","I never took classic business classes in college, so I don't have the background that any of the people running large companies have.","I do feel, in a sense, the rules of engagement for citizenship has changed, and we must encourage other people to speak up and to take action.","I've traveled around the world, and what's so revealing is that, despite the differences in culture, politics, language, how people dress, there is a universal feeling that we all want the same thing. We deeply want to be respected and appreciated for our differences.","When we began Starbucks, what I wanted to try to do was to create a set of values, guiding principles, and culture.","I'm not as interested in what you make as I am in what you're passionate about. What business are you really in?","Our history is based on extending the brand to categories within the guardrails of Starbucks.","You must find something that you deeply love and are passionate about and are willing to sacrifice a lot to achieve.","We live in an age where everything is based on the short term.","The growth of the company and the license that Starbucks has is to participate in other food and beverage opportunities. We have a global business... and in many parts of the world, tea is much, much bigger than coffee, and we're going to bring tea and bring our capability and our understanding of what we've done for coffee to tea.","My son is trying to be a sports writer, and my daughter is a college student. She wants to be a comedy writer, and she's at film school. I discouraged both of them early on from getting involved in Starbucks. I didn't think it would be fair; plus, they didn't have any interest anyway.","Customers have different need states and life experiences.","When I first discovered in the early 1980s the Italian espresso bars in my trip to Italy, the vision was to re-create that for America - a third place that had not existed before. Starbucks re-created that in America in our own image; a place to go other than home or work. We also created an industry that did not exist: specialty coffee.","If you look at coffee, tea, food and juice, we think there are inherent opportunities. If you look at health bars or grab-and-go products that are in our stores, we think we can significantly enhance them and make them more widely available.","I think Starbucks created a platform and, ultimately, a runway for many other companies to emulate. I suspect if we had not achieved what we have, there would have been many regional brands that would have succeeded. But I'm not sure there would have been a national brand of the scope of Starbucks.","Beverages have to be created. And they're created by looking at what trend is in, say, the fashion industry - what color's hot right now.","Turning a culture around is very difficult to do because it's based on a series of many, many decisions, and the organization is framed by those decisions.","People ask me what's the most important function when you're starting an organization or setting up the kind of culture and values that are going to endure. The discipline I believe so strongly in is H.R., and its the last discipline that gets funded.","There's this myth that has been exacerbated by others that Starbucks means a $4 cup of coffee, which is not true.","Even though people are under economic pressure, they still want to support those brands with values that are compatible with their own.","My mother taught me something at a young age - she said 'you are the company you keep'. To define yourself by some label or some level of resources - that's pretty shallow.","There's an energy and excitement when you're building a company. You have so much tail wind. You're planting new seeds. But it's also scary, because there's no safety net.","At an early age, my mother gave me this feeling that anything is possible, and I believe that.","It's different when you're trying to turn something around, especially something that you built, at a time when so many constituents - the media, Wall Street, competitors, ex-employees - are all saying that Starbucks's best days are behind it, and that Schultz is never going to be able to bring it back.","We need to put ourselves in the shoes of our customers. That is my new battle cry. Live and breathe Starbucks the way our customers do.","The response to the Starbucks brand has been phenomenal in our international markets.","We need to reinvent food at Starbucks. Less could be more.","We woke up one day, and all the sudden Starbucks was in the middle of this political crossfire between the people who want to bring a gun into Starbucks and the people who want to prevent it. It is a very difficult, fragile situation.","In many places where coffee is grown, deforestation is a major issue. With Starbucks' position in the marketplace and the respect and relationships we have, we can - and have, in some cases - been able to educate and influence people.","I think the most important thing that I think everyone in America must have is belief that wherever they live, whatever station they have in life, that the American dream is alive and well. I think the fracturing of trust and confidence is in the American dream.","Post-9/11, we saw an immediate uptick in the amount of people in our stores, all over the country. People wanted that human connection. We are not going to fracture the Starbucks experience.","This may sound a bit naive, but I got here by believing in big dreams.","I could've just walked away but I never could have forgiven myself to allow Starbucks to drift into mediocrity or not be relevant. I just couldn't be a bystander.","For Starbucks, there will be no shortage of the highest-quality arabica beans. I suspect that for some others there could potentially be a problem, not in the near term, but over time."],"Howard Scott":["At this time, it's all still proposed.","A criminal is a person with predatory instincts without sufficient capital to form a corporation."],"Howard Shore":["I love working with an orchestra, but there are many ways to make music.","Music is essentially an emotional language, so you want to feel something from the relationships and build music based on those feelings.","'Saturday Night Live' was actually started with a show that Lorne Michaels and I did at a summer camp called Timberlane in Ontario when we were 14 and 15. We would do an improvisational show with music, comedy and acting.","The sarangi, the ney flute are pretty ancient instruments.","When you're working on film music, you're only working on 20, 30-minute sections at a time.","I read all of the books by Tolkien, including 'The Hobbit,' when I was in my twenties, and his deep love of nature and all things green resonates deeply with me.","You can find the whole world of a film in one instrument, or you can find a world of sound in the orchestra.","Composing is sort of an intuitive act. You have to put yourself in the right frame of mind.","I like to read and dream and create music that is based on the imagery of text. If you have the combination of a great book and a great filmmaker, what could be better for the composer?","When you see 'Lord of the Rings,' you want to feel like you've been dropped into it and that you're part of it. You don't want to be aware of how it's being done; you just want it to feel really seamless.","I always believed 'The Fly' to be a classic opera story. It's a tale of love and death, true love surviving in the face of physical decay and ultimate sacrifice.","The music for 'The Departed' could have been played by an orchestra, but you make a decision about orchestration based on the context of the film. You want the music to broaden the scope of a film, not just repeat what you're seeing.","A lot of what a composer does has to do with storytelling, and there are different ways of fusing music with picture to express different storytelling ideas.","My first score for 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy, 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' was the beginning of my journey into the world of Tolkien, and I will always hold a special fondness for the music and the experience.","'Hugo' is made in the classical style of the 1940s.","All of the silent films had live music accompaniment, so it's actually a very rich period in music.","It is very gratifying to see the music from 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy find a new life on the concert stage as it is performed by different orchestras and choruses throughout the world.","I think once a year it's good to look back at the history of Oscar and to embrace the great work that everybody's done this year and set it in place to the great work that's gone on before us.","I think 'Two Towers' is a completely distinct film from 'Fellowship of the Ring' or 'Return of the King.' I think that you can watch them as a group and watch how the story evolves, but I think each one was made in its own entirety, and each one has its own palate of sound and music and color and characterization.","I live in Tuxedo Park, N.Y. and spend time in the West Village, where my wife Elizabeth Cotnoir, a writer-producer and documentary filmmaker, has an office.","I'm interested in good collaborations and in working with directors who bring something new and interesting out of you.","Theater and film are essentially the same - just different kinds of storytelling.","I actually like the collaboration of working with different artists."],"Howard Staunton":["The Queen is by much the most powerful of the forces.","Be cautious of playing your Queen in front of your King and in subjecting yourself to a discovered check. It is better when check is given to your King to interpose a man that attacks the checking Piece than with one that does not.","If, during the course of the game, it be discovered that any error or illegality has been committed in the moves of the pieces, the moves must be retraced, and the necessary correction made, without penalty.","A player is said to have the opposition when he can place his King directly in front of the adverse King, with only one square between them. This is often an important advantage in ending games.","A Rook is of the value of five Pawns and a fraction, and may be exchanged for a minor Piece and two Pawns. Two Rooks may be exchanged for three minor Pieces.","Each player, it will be observed, has eight superior Pieces or officers, and eight minor ones which are called Pawns; and, for the purpose of distinction, the Pieces and Pawns of one party are of a different color from those of the other.","For playing a man to a square to which it cannot be legally moved, the adversary, at his option, may require him to move the man legally, or to move the King.","For touching an adversary's man, when it cannot be captured, the offender must move his King.","Having marshalled the men in battle order, as shown in the first diagram, you will observe that each party has two ranks of men, on the first of which stand the superior Pieces, and on the next the eight Pawns.","If either player abandon the game by quitting the table in anger, or in an otherwise offensive manner; or by momentarily resigning the game; or refuses to abide by the decision of the Umpire, the game must be scored against him.","In Castling, the King must be moved first, or before the Rook is quitted. If the Rook be quitted before the King is touched, the opposing player may demand that the move of the Rook shall stand without the Castling being completed.","It is the duty of the Umpire to determine all questions submitted to him according to these laws, when they apply, and according to his best judgment when they do not apply.","Many persons have been confused and discouraged at the very outset of the study by the great variety and the delicate distinctions of the openings: and this has constituted a fault in many otherwise excellent manuals for the learner.","The Bishop and Knight, in contradistinction to the Queen and Rook, are called Minor Pieces.","The Bishop moves diagonally forwards or backwards, to the extent of the Board.","The Chess-board must be placed with a white square at the right-hand corner.","The Pawn moves only one square at a time, and that straight forward, except in the act of capturing, when it takes one step diagonally to the right or left file on to the square occupied by the man taken, and continues on that file until it captures another man.","The penalty for exceeding the time limit is the forfeiture of the game.","The Queen is usually reckoned equal, in average situations, to two Rooks and a Pawn, but towards the end of a game she is hardly so valuable as two Rooks.","When a Piece or Pawn is in a situation to be taken by the enemy, it is said to be en prise. To put a piece en prise, is to play it so that it may be captured.","When neither party can give checkmate, the game is drawn.","When the King is checked, or any valuable Piece in danger from the attack of an enemy, you are said to interpose a man when you play it between the attacked and attacking Piece."],"Howard Stern":["I seem to be some sort of lightning rod. I just really irritate people, you know? I really do.","I'm the voice of honesty.","I'm sickened by all religions. Religion has divided people. I don't think there's any difference between the pope wearing a large hat and parading around with a smoking purse and an African painting his face white and praying to a rock.","And rather than hide that, I would rather put that out on the radio and let someone see the full range of emotions. If you're going to be strong on the radio, you got to let it all out, even the ugly stuff. And you can't apologize for it.","When you hire me, you hire a nut who is going to work 24 hours a day for you and never, ever burn his audience.","Late night television is ready for someone like me... standards have gone to an all-time low.","Well, first of all, I'm worth every penny.","I don't talk about my salary.","I don't think there's one thing I've ever said on the radio that would have been found indecent or obscene.","I believe I am doing the work for humanity. This show is so uplifting.","It causes me great pain to sue the company I work for. Nevertheless, I had to do it. Suffice it to say, there's a dispute and I believe I haven't been given what is mine.","I've never come into anything successful before. I've always been hired by horrible radio stations with horrendous reputations and nothing to lose.","I've come to appreciate other people's talents.","It's no treat being in bed with me.","'The New York Times' list is a bunch of crap. They ought to call it the editor's choice. It sure isn't based on sales.","I'm on the air five hours, and I blurt out anything in my head. Dangerous? Maybe.","Okay, well, I guess I'm still a kid. Because when I get really angry and fired up and I feel like my back is up against the wall, I will say vicious things.","There are things that I won't do on the radio. I mean, the next logical question is, what won't you do. I say, well, you know, you've got to find out when you're on the air.","I think I'm probably a little too desperate to be successful.","I will never feel successful.","My show was revolutionary, ground-breaking. When I came on the scene, people were not doing a thing.","Yes, I believe blue material is funny, but if that's all you've got, you're dead in the water. It's not good.","I don't like being 50 and I don't like thinking about death.","I think people of lesser talent will become stars.","I still feel like I gotta prove something. There are a lot of people hoping I fail. But I like that. I need to be hated.","We are busy planning the launch of the channel. I am busy planning all kinds of events that go on the channel without me. I have started producing a sound for the channel.","You've got to be a little vicious. You've got to be narcissistic. You've got to be on fire about your career.","I didn't listen to executives.","If you're a Christian you don't sit there and worry about what somebody else is doing, if they're happy and they're committed in a relationship.","Every time I went on the radio, I would take the crummiest radio station, the station that was like a toilet bowl. I would go on there and build up the ratings, so you couldn't do any worse.","I wanted to go hide. I wasn't looking to be more famous, I'm famous enough.","I'm not looking for a paycheck.","What a crazy idea to put me on a family show!","I feel blessed, I really feel fulfilled.","I've actually apologized to some people I was a real jerk to, because I feel ashamed. I didn't need to be that hungry. There was something going on inside me when I was angry and feeling very threatened and not feeling good about myself."],"Howard Stringer":["In the digital world, he who hesitates is abandoned. So you have to generate 3-D excitement with as many devices as you can find.","The hardest thing about being at Sony was not the travel; it was being divorced from the public and private life I had in New York. Travelling as much as I did, while I didn't lose connection with my friends, I lost a sense of belonging.","Doesn't anyone here think this sounds like a vision of hell? While we are all competing or dying, when will there be time for sex or music or books? Stop the world, I want to get off.","Frankly, I was surprised at how generous the Japanese press has been to the idea of a foreigner running Sony.","Free is not an alternative. My company did not turn a profit last year.","Content and technology are strange bed fellows. We are joined together. Sometimes we misunderstand each other. But isn't that after all the definition of marriage?","I was very short. Everybody else was two years older in my class, and I had curly hair and was teacher's pet.","The energy of the Kennedy years was completely compelling... I had a sense of a generous society eager to change the world. Idealism was very contagious. So that's why I went to America. I didn't intend to stay.","Japan can't get anything on the market very cheaply because it has a large, relatively highly paid workforce which you can't fire.","People are going to like 3-D in their family photos.","When color TV arrived, it just sat there and you saw color. I've been to retail stores where there were no 3-D glasses at all and the 3-D images were all blurred. People were coming in and saying, 'I don't want to buy that.' There's a lot of marketing connected to introducing technologies and especially introducing new experiences.","Video games lend themselves completely to 3-D.","The futures of Crackle and Hulu and so forth become more and more important as we connect to more and more devices. We need our content to make our services as attractive as Apple's or Amazon's or Microsoft's. We're in a brave new world of fierce competition.","I left the golden age of documentaries to go into the golden days of the 'CBS Evening News.' You could see that the audiences were eroding.","I get really frustrated during a crisis when I go through all the cable channels and find - very often with the exception of CNN - that I'm not watching news at all. You think, 'Well, God... there are talk shows, talk shows, talk shows and everyone is an expert!'","You will see a 3-D movie in a movie theater for the shared experience of it - or for a date, and so on. You don't all sit at home getting your entertainment in a vacuum.","I've played a Nintendo Wii. I don't see it as a competitor. It's more of an expensive niche game device. We're selling a lot of PlayStation 3s now and it's still the best way to buy a Blu-ray player.","For Sony, owning a studio is a gamble and probably a pretty good one, now that in the broadband era having content is a great advantage when you sell devices that in a ubiquitous world of distribution can actually show programs, movies, content directly to the consumer. So that you actually create, in a digital world, real synergy.","When the digital world is really here, movies can be disseminated from satellite direct to homes and direct to small theaters in Mongolia and northern Russia and obscure places that the market for movies is going to grow and grow and grow.","The American movie, in part because America's a melting pot, the cultural hodgepodge that America makes, generates movies that have appeal across all international boundaries. And that's really not true for most domestic film industries. It's no longer true of France and Italy, less true than it used to be of the U.K.","Sometimes Hollywood is a small town on the West Coast of America at the furthest point from everywhere else, and that can make it a little provincial and insular."],"Howard Terpning":["I personally don't care for abstract art. I have always felt, 'To each his own.' There's art out there for everybody.","Before I reached 10 years old, I knew I was going to be an artist."],"Howard Thurman":["Twilight - a time of pause when nature changes her guard. All living things would fade and die from too much light or too much dark, if twilight were not.","A dream is the bearer of a new possibility, the enlarged horizon, the great hope.","During times of war, hatred becomes quite respectable even though it has to masquerade often under the guise of patriotism.","At the core of life is a hard purposefulness, a determination to live.","There is something in every one of you that waits and listens for the sound of the genuine in yourself. It is the only true guide you will ever have. And if you cannot hear it, you will all of your life spend your days on the ends of strings that somebody else pulls.","Community cannot for long feed on itself; it can only flourish with the coming of others from beyond, their unknown and undiscovered brothers.","Commitment means that it is possible for a man to yield the nerve center of his consent to a purpose or cause, a movement or an ideal, which may be more important to him than whether he lives or dies.","He who fears is literally delivered to destruction."],"Howard Warren Buffett":["Soil is a living ecosystem, and is a farmer's most precious asset. A farmer's productive capacity is directly related to the health of his or her soil.","There are more living organisms in a tablespoon of highly organic soil than there are people on the planet.","When I was 5, my father was very much my hero. And he ran for political office in a very thankless campaign for a very thankless position. And he did it because his mother had instilled in him, if you are someone who has the capacity to make a great change, you have the responsibility.","I was pulled out of Omaha when I was younger because my father started to work, when he was done serving as county commissioner, at Archer Daniels Midland.","If I'm home, I'll be happy. And if I'm around family, and if I'm working on projects with friends, I don't know what else I'd want to be doing.","I've spent so much time with my dad traveling and seeing the ground-level change that we've been able to make through philanthropy and trip over trip, time over time, country over country, home after home we've been invited into, given tea, given food that people didn't have to give us, I mean all of these things."],"Howard Wilkinson":["I am a firm believer that if you score one goal the other team have to score two to win.","If they hadn't scored, we would've won.","Gary Speed was honourable, trustworthy and a joy to manage. He was honest, he was a role model and he was a great bloke. An avid learner, he recognised responsibility and he was always fully committed.","Managers are obsessed with the game. It's very, very difficult, if not impossible, to live a balanced lifestyle.","The chairmen of the largest companies in the world can cancel an appointment or move a board meeting; a manager cannot change the date of a game. In the combined 42 years that Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger have managed in English football, I can only remember one occasion when Sir Alex did not attend a Manchester United game.","You can go to the pictures or read a book, but football constantly comes back into your mind. It's not a job, it's a life. It takes up your time, thoughts and energy and it can damage relationships with those around you."],"Howard Zinn":["Dissent is the highest form of patriotism.","There is no flag large enough to cover the shame of killing innocent people.","In the United States today, the Declaration of Independence hangs on schoolroom walls, but foreign policy follows Machiavelli.","Most wars, after all, present themselves as humanitarian endeavors to help people.","When people don't understand that the government doesn't have their interests in mind, they're more susceptible to go to war.","Americans have been taught that their nation is civilized and humane. But, too often, U.S. actions have been uncivilized and inhumane.","One certain effect of war is to diminish freedom of expression.","War itself is the enemy of the human race.","If those in charge of our society - politicians, corporate executives, and owners of press and television - can dominate our ideas, they will be secure in their power. They will not need soldiers patrolling the streets. We will control ourselves.","If the gods had intended for people to vote, they would have given us candidates.","We need to decide that we will not go to war, whatever reason is conjured up by the politicians or the media, because war in our time is always indiscriminate, a war against innocents, a war against children."],"Howell Raines":["I stepped on a land mine named Jayson Blair.","Frankly, no newspaper is set up to monitor for cheats and fabricators.","Something is clearly wrong with Kansas and the rest of Middle America when it comes to letting economic self-interest guide their voting."],"Howie Carr":["You know, back in the 1950s and '60s, when J. Edgar Hoover was making the FBI the respected organization it used to be, oftentimes they would find a fugitive and basically have his house surrounded, and then put out a press release saying he was on the top 10 most wanted list. And 10 minutes later, he'd be arrested.","I used to think Cape Wind was a great idea. That was when Ted Kennedy was alive and railing about how he might spill his Chivas if he had to keep maneuvering the Mya around all those noisy seagull-murdering wind turbines. Anything Ted Kennedy was against, I was for.","You look at the descriptions of Whitey by law enforcement during his early years, and they sum him up pretty well. He was the same guy 40 years later; he just had $40 million more, and had committed 40 more murders.","Reporters used to be blue-collar; at the Globe now, it's practically required that you have a trust fund.","I think among the retired FBI agents there are some who would not like to see him come back, but I think the people running the FBI now are interested in catching him.","About 25 years ago, I started out as a reporter covering politics. And that sort of just evolved into organized crime, because organized crime and politics were the same thing in Boston.","The higher someone's profile, the easier it is for a defendant to trade him up to the feds. Mr. Big is always a better catch than Mr. Small.","Nobody has ever denied that when it comes to his trade - gigolo - John Forbes Kerry is one of the all-time greats. He's in the Gigolo Hall of Fame. See, a really good gigolo might snag one heiress in a lifetime with a nine-figure trust fund. Kerry has married two. When it comes to gigolos, he's Steve Jobs.","Scott Brown may be the last Republican to win a statewide fight in Massachusetts for a very long time. He caught the machine flat-footed in January 2010 when he out-hustled Martha Coakley and stole the Senate seat Ted Kennedy held all those years. And since then, the Democrats haven't lost a single statewide fight.","After all these years, it's still amazing what Obama is allowed to get away with. He says low gas prices in 2009 were caused by a terrible economy, but then claims that the lower number of illegal aliens crossing the border is because of his border policies, not the same lousy economy.","Joe Biden was first elected to the Senate in 1972 at age 30. Somewhere around 1992, he should have had to go out and get a real job.","But the indisputable fact is, a huge percentage of Obama's voters are basically wards of the state. There are millions of them, and they have no intention of voting for anyone who might want them to ever go out and work for a living - 'no matter what.'","Anyone who doesn't think the welfare-industrial complex is trying to increase dependency isn't paying attention.","In the end, that's what it comes down to with Mitt Romney. He's running as the non-Barack Obama.","As much as the Democrats try to change the subject, this election will be about Barack Obama, period. Mitt's speech last night hit all the right notes, but this fight is not about him. He's just the vessel. Now the question is, does this guy at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. who thinks the private sector is doing fine get another four years?","Barack Obama is like the old joke about boats. The two best days of owning a boat are the day you buy it and the day you sell it.","Michelle Obama - they don't call her Mooch-elle for nothing.","You know the green grifters have no argument when they start raising the 'no blood for oil' cry on the blogs.

When you're young, you want to be like everybody else, and I was like nobody else. I couldn't sit still. I was impulsive. I still am. What is now called a 'talent' did not serve me well as a child. I didn't have friends. I was really an outcast.","One of the great pleasures of having children is spending one-on-one time with them. Sadly, I could do that for only a few minutes at a time. I'd never say that ADD/ADHD is a gift or a blessing. And if someone says it is a gift, I'd love to return it.","People who annoy people are the luckiest people in the world.","You can't be the dad who takes your kid out after your wife has said, 'No ice cream,' buys the ice cream, and says, 'Don't tell your mother.'

Whether that means making paths out of towels so I don't touch the carpet or removing the comforters or just not touching things. Even sitting on a plane with a bunch of other people - it's really hard for me.","My point of reference is life, in everything that I do.","I think being a dad is scary. I mean, I'm not that grown-up myself.","I have to be the only person in America who had a doctor say to him, 'Please don't put any more surgical gloves on your head and inflate them.'","'Deal or No Deal' works nicely with my ADD/ADHD symptoms. I show up, meet the contestants, and move around the set. I'm not stuck behind a pedestal reading trivia questions. I've always had problems sitting still and listening for long periods of time. The show spares me these challenges. I can live in the moment. It's like a standup act.","Most of my act is improvisation. I'm inspired for the moment. Standing there in front of 2,000 or 3,000 people you don't know can be pretty inspiring.","Regardless of what I do, whether I write a book or whether I act or whether I host, I'll always do stand-up comedy because those moments, that's what I crave. If I do something funny, and I hear a crowd laugh in that moment, we're all sharing the exact same experience and the exact same feeling.","In the mid-1970s, there was this huge boom of stand-up comedy throughout North America. I went to see a show at a club called Yuk-Yuks, in Toronto, and I was just fascinated. I ended up coming back for amateur hour on a Monday at midnight and got up there without any thought as to what might come of it.","Stand-up comedy is a sickness. Who wouldn't want a room full of people laughing and screaming at you just because of who you are? Nothing is as good, except maybe having a baby.","I have an insatiable desire to be the center of attention.","I've spent more time in Las Vegas than any other city, almost including L.A. where I live.","What is the luck of the draw that me - me - who finally writes a book, it comes out in the - in the - in the time, in the center of the first pandemic, H1N1? And I'm going out on signings, and I'm going out to the public. This is the one time when I need to be hermetically sealed.","I once missed an appointment because I left my house, I locked the door. And then I thought, like anybody else, you know, 'I don't think I locked the door.' I just kept going back to the door. And I couldn't stop myself from checking and checking.","I'm a huge fan of mine. I go to just about every show I do.","Everything runs its course. We had told a lot of stories that happened in our life. My kid was getting older, and we were running out of stories to tell.","I was totally involved in Bobby's World from the time we started the idea to sitting with the artists on how he would look, to the script meetings, the music, the lyrics, the songs.","If I'm a game show host, will someone buy a ticket to see me do standup? To do a dramatic role in a movie?","It's really not that hard. If I do a Tonight Show, it's six or seven minutes. If I do a concert, it's 90 minutes. If I do an interview, that's 15 minutes. So by the end of the day I've done three hours worth of work.","The success of any stand-up act comes out of life experience.","There were 84 original episodes. It was rated No. 1 and No. 2 on the Fox Children's Network. We figured it was time to make it available to people who have never watched it.","There's no skill. You can be a rock and move into another cash bracket.","We sat down and told stories that happened to us in our childhood, to our children. They were all basically based on the truth. These stories were funny and poignant to us. They just took off. These are all stories from my life.","We were a very small circle of writers. Everybody brought to the table their own life experience.","You release these things, and if they fly then you have more.","I am beloved by millions.","I've been chased. I've been pushed. I've been screamed at. I've been verbally abused. I've been afraid for my safety. But I did it all in the name of entertainment.","You can go home with a lot of money with absolutely no skill.","I'm from Canada, so Thanksgiving to me is just Thursday with more food. And I'm thankful for that.","I'm always on the verge of death in my head.","I know intellectually that if I shake somebody's hand that I'm not going to get sick and die.","I think the solution to making this world better is if we would just be healthy, mentally.","What are the two biggest things online? Selfies and emojis. We're combining them. Instead of sending some character that means nothing with a hat - what if it was your face doing something? Me-moji.","The doctor heard my heartbeat and found out I had an irregular heartbeat. I was not symptomatic or aware of my symptoms. I had no idea that this could make me five times more likely to have a stroke than somebody who doesn't have this.","I think the thrust of any child is to try to fit in and be part of it. And I can't tell you how many times my humor, you know, what I thought was humor ended up making me the outsider. Like I'd be, I go, 'It's a joke.' And they'd go, 'Well, what was funny?' And they just thought I was insane.","Diana Ross saw me on Merv Griffin and hired me to be her opening act.","I once called construction companies to bid on an addition to the school library so that there would suddenly be people outside, measuring the building. 'Who authorized this?' the principal would ask. The answer: 'Howie Mandel.'","I go to therapy a lot. And I'm - I'm open about that, and I try to get the help so that I - so that I can cope and - and make my way in life and with my family.","I have thoughts - obtrusive thoughts and rituals that have to - it's like a broken re - a skipping record. And if these thoughts or these triggers happen to me through maybe shaking a hand or just a thought or just - then I can't get past it and move on with my life.","If you come to any of my live shows, you'll see, it's very frenetic. I have the attention span of a gnat.","The biggest void that people can have in their lives is a sense of humor. Spending your life with someone who doesn't have that wouldn't be palatable.","My wife doesn't cook, so we eat out every night. It's not fine dining or anything - we're not fancy people.","I love voice-acting - I can go to work without wearing pants. Although I did wear pants during Gremlins. But it's always more comfortable to work without. And if you notice, I relate to Gizmo in that way because he also works without pants. I have furry little legs, too.","Unlike 'Deal or No Deal,' which is for the entire family, my standup is not for the entire family.","Some version of 'Deal or No Deal' airs in 120 countries. And they play it exactly the same way, with models and briefcases. It crosses language and culture and gender, because it's the simplest game in the world, and everyone wants to press their luck.","Standup keeps me grounded and keeps me in touch. I get to go from small towns to big cities, across Canada and the U.S., and you're out there and talking to people. You get a sense of what they respond to.","Part of my humor is the fact that I love coming out of left field. I don't want people to expect what is going to happen next.","I was always incredibly obsessed with germs and cleaning and taking shower after shower after shower. Even when I was very young, I wouldn't tie my shoelaces because they had touched the ground. I had continuous repetitive thoughts that I couldn't get past. As a child, my mind was a lot busier than I was.","I may be more passionate about my comedy because that's the one place where I feel comfortable - because I'm in the now. Performing is the only time of the day when I have to really force every ounce of concentration into whatever's happening in that moment.","I was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD/ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) as an adult, but I don't remember a time when I didn't have them. Back in the 1960s, when I was growing up, my symptoms didn't have a name, and you didn't go to the doctor to find out.","After I impulsively revealed that I have OCD on a talk show, I was devastated. I often do things without thinking. That's my ADD/ADHD talking. Out in public, after I did the show, people came to me and said, 'Me, too.' They were the most comforting words I've ever heard."],"Howlin' Wolf":["Somebody has been cashing checks, and they've been bouncing back on us. And these people, the poor class of Negroes and the poor class of white people, they're getting tired of it.","I couldn't do no yodelin', so I turned to howlin'. And it's done me just fine.","Farming's always been my business.","I raise corn and cattle and soybeans. Soybeans are a good cash crop.","I just play blues for fun.","I used to have a radio show. That's how I started foolin' around with recording.","The idea of 'Spoonful' was that it doesn't take a large quantity of anything to be good. If you have a little money when you need it, you're right there in the right spot, that'll buy you a whole lot."],"Hozier":["Social media is an advertisement for the superficial extroverted self.","By nature, I'm an awkward person; I'm a gangly introvert.","You grow up and recognise that in an educated, secular society, there's no excuse for ignorance. You have to recognise in yourself, and challenge yourself, that if you see racism or homophobia or misogyny in a secular society, as a member of that society, you should challenge it. You owe it to the betterment of society.","I found the experience of falling in love or being in love was a death: a death of everything. You kind of watch yourself die in a wonderful way, and you experience for the briefest moment - if you see yourself for a moment through their eyes - everything you believed about yourself gone. In a death-and-rebirth sense.","I try to face things without regret, or make sure that I'm happy with things and leave nothing unsaid if I can.","I hate nightclubs, and I get fed up very quickly in crowded rooms. I enjoy being around people I know.","We all run the risk of thinking that people have common sense sometimes.","It sounds like I'm joking when I say it, but when I wrote 'Take Me To Church' and a lot of these things, I didn't think they would be hits. I thought I was writing for a potentially smaller audience.","I try to be happy. I try to face things without regret or make sure that I'm happy with things and leave nothing unsaid if I can.","I like playing with light and shade. I like saying awful things in very pretty ways.","I think it is important to differentiate between lip service towards something and actually making change.","I'm not cross about the idea of baptism; I just think the idea that when a child is born it is inherently sinful and carries sin and needs to be cleaned in order for it to be all right and all good with its creator, I just think that's an absurd notion.","I have a bit of a love affair with fairy tales and some of the ideas of Irish mythology, like Oscar Wilde and W.B. Yeats, who captured a lot of that very beautifully.","It's funny: Your relationship changes with a song over time. After a year or so, you're a different person, so your songs, you don't connect with them like you did.","One of my favorite books is 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' by George Orwell, and 'Catcher in the Rye,' obviously, is a big influence and is one of my favorites.","One of my first festivals was Oxygen 2006. It had this amazing lineup with the Arctic Monkeys on their first or second album, the Strokes, Kings of Leon, the Magic Numbers and then the Who and James Brown. I waited in the pit for a good eight hours to see James Brown.","There is no singer I can think of who can touch Ella Fitzgerald. And when Billie Holiday sings, she's merciless about it. Her voice has just this immaculate sadness - even in happy songs, there was something that was so broken about it.","I'm uncomfortable with selfies and status updates documenting mundane pieces of my life, which I don't think should be of interest to anyone else.","The main thing is, I can't stay up late partying when I'm on tour. That's not good for my voice or my health in general.","If I could, I'd sing old French songs or American folk music, but I sure as hell can't do it as well as Mississippi John Hurt - no way in hell am I getting near that!","I'm still finding my feet in many ways as a performer. I'm not an extrovert, and certainly the attention isn't what drew me to it, and I find that quite jarring at times. I used to stress a lot about shows and get palpitations before shows, but eventually you learn to love it, and it is a thrill.","Blues is a very physical music.","You grow up and recognize that in any educated secular society, there's no excuse for ignorance. You have to recognize in yourself, and challenge yourself, that if you see racism or homophobia or misogyny in a secular society, as a member of that society, you should challenge it. You owe it to the betterment of society.","It's so easy to look forward when you're travelling; you spend your life looking forward, thinking, 'What's next? When do I get time to work on my music again? Or when do I get time to get my 'normal' life back?'","I had just discovered jazz, and I started singing in a kind of blues cover band at the age of 15. We called ourselves - it was a terrible name - the Blue Zoots. We couldn't actually get our hands on zoot suits, nor did we dress in blue. We did covers of Screamin' Jay Hawkins and kind of Blues Brothers repertoire stuff.","It's a very, very interesting experience to be talking to people who are such icons in their own right. When Adele came to a show, I was just talking to her, and at the time, I thought, 'I'm just having a chat with somebody.' But then I heard myself say, 'Oh, I was talking to Adele the other day,' and it's as strange as you'd imagine.","There are a lot of recurring themes that I resonated with when I read 'A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.'","I was never academically driven in English, but, again, Tom Waits is a perfect example of an influence. He writes so immaculately and paints so perfectly a world and the characters within it. There are writers like that who are my influences: vivid and gifted storytellers.","Biggest musical influences would be people like Nina Simone and Tom Waits. A huge amount of writers like Leslie Feist and Paul Simon.","My musical education was grounded in blues and Chicago blues - John Lee Hooker and Otis Redding.","I tried to avoid anything that caused me frustration or grief or duress. I played FarmVille and procrastinated like all teenagers.","For me growing up, I had a Christian upbringing, and I just noticed this Catholic influence in school.","Being 16 is the worst time to be anybody, there is not enough tea in China to persuade me to be that young again. I wasn't very happy with myself.","Some of the earlier stuff I did in studio with producers was very pop-directed, which I was uncomfortable with.","Being in a studio is quite a creative and energetic process.","I used to almost not look forward to recording, because it was like, 'Okay, what am I going to have to sacrifice?'","I love making music, but if you make something that inspires somebody else to make something, without getting too airy-fairy, you've contributed to the zeitgeist in some way, and that's just an amazing feeling.","I'm reading a lot of poetry because it's a lot easier to dip in and dip out when you've got 10 minutes to yourself.","I've definitely received a lot of support in Nashville; it's a huge music town. I like country music. Like any genre I'm largely unfamiliar with, there are elements I really enjoy and elements that go over my head.","When I first started to sing, I just swung at it with an axe.","I think it all started with Nina Simone. When I was maybe seven or eight, I used to listen to one of her albums every night before I went to sleep. For me, her voice was everything.","The best vocalists I can think of are female.","I always thought of myself as a very, very obscure artist.","I love Muddy Waters and Nina Simone. I also watched 'The Blues Brothers' movie over and over.","Growing up, I always saw the hypocrisy of the Catholic church. The history speaks for itself, and I grew incredibly frustrated and angry. I essentially just put that into my words.","I never wrote music for the mainstream.","My dad was a blues musician around Dublin when I was a baby, so the only music I would listen to growing up was John Lee Hooker and Muddy Waters. It's music that feels like home to me.","There are a few Irish writers who have a very strong influence on me, especially on the 'Take Me to Church' EP.","I just hate getting my hair cut.","I feel my duty is to make music.","Growing up in Ireland, there are a lot of aspects of God that hang in the air. And my music reflects that.","I don't know if I'll ever get married. I have no plans to not get married.","I think marriage is a scary concept. It's a scary concept for anybody. I'm not sure where I sit with that.","The myth of fame and the myth of success is cultivated because it is monetisable and it is profitable.","I'm always eager to make new music.","The way I did the first album... the way I wrote 'Church'... was just to trust my instincts with the music and let it kind of do what it does.","Either somebody has equal rights, or they don't. And certainly in the Irish constitution, marriage is genderless. There's no mention of a man and a woman.","I didn't even have that many close LGBT friends or anything like that, but I suppose it was growing up and becoming aware of how you are in a cultural landscape that is blatantly homophobic... you turn around and say, 'Why did I grow up in a homophobic place? Why did I grow up in a misogynistic place?'","There was a moment, a few weeks after I signed, that it actually hit me. I was signed to a major label.","It was a rural upbringing by the seaside. A real quiet place surrounded by fields. I had to travel into town for school and stuff like that.","I'm quite tame as touring musicians go.","It's a surreal experience filming promotion with Ryan Seacrest and meeting Top 40 pop artists.","Religion wasn't imposed on me.","I dabbled with faith, and I explored religion quite thoroughly.","By the time I was in my teens, I was listening to Delta blues and jazz.","I love the sound of voices singing together, congregational singing, anything like gospel, or folk, or sea shanties.","I spent quite a bit of time in choirs, growing up, and in the world-touring music group Anuna.","Rarely do I finish a song lyrically before I have a musical idea there, but then again, rarely ever would I finish a song musically before starting the lyrical ideas. So a lot of the time, they come in tandem, or they just come at a glance.","I find lyrics can come at any time during the day, as can music.","Especially on the road, it's very hard to find time to actually sit down and write.","If I don't think something's worth saying, I don't think it's quite there, I'd rather just not say it, to be honest. In that case, I'd rather wait 'till the thought is ready, 'till I feel like I'm happy with everything.","I would love to get in trouble with the Catholic Church. I'm not religious myself, but my issue is with the organization. It's an organization of men - it's not about faith.","I love a good party - but I'm not all that attracted to a celebrity lifestyle.","I was always drawn to gospel music and the roots of African-American music. It's the foundation of rock and roll.","There's not a lot of room for thinking in popular culture; there's not a lot of room for being conflicted.","The public discourse online is not done through the polite language of debate.","I figured the songs wouldn't make much of a splash. I didn't think 'Take Me To Church' would play on the radio or get in the charts, and I didn't think about dealing with a global audience.","The first time I heard Tom Waits, it was like everything just flipped. It was just this fascination with him. My cousin showed me 'Small Change,' and I just couldn't get over that this was a white guy singing.","I've been a total Tom Waits dork for a long, long time.","I remember writing lyrics for 'Take Me to Church' for a long time before I even had a song in mind for. It's not that I was trying to write that song for a year, but sometimes you just kind of collect lyrical and musical ideas and don't actually complete the song until you feel like they work together and have a home.","I'm an awful control freak at times when it comes to production and stuff like that.","I will play around with an idea for a very long time until it's found it's feet and it's good enough to become a song.","I'd love to do something with somebody like James Blake.","Things were never as exciting for me as the first gig in New York.","The more I come to L.A., the more it's amazing.","If I fall into a city, I fall into a scene, and I just don't want to get distracted and enjoy myself too much. There's too much work to be done.","I love a lot of Irish folk music and Irish folk songs.","I think my parents took me to see Sting when I was very, very young.","I remember one of the first albums I got was an album called 'Thin Lizzy: Live and Dangerous.'","All songs, all pieces of art, reflect the world that they were made in and the values of those artists and the hopes and aspirations of the people who listen to that music and who made that music.","A lot of the 'leave' campaign was centered around a thinly veiled xenophobia, just 'control our own borders.' It's not a good look. I don't think it represents Britain; I don't think it represents the U.K. all too well. It breaks my heart for my generation in Britain who are going to suffer.","I wish I had more time to read. I'm always traveling.","Regardless of the sexual orientation behind a relationship, it is still a relationship and still love.","As I listened more and more to the music that moved me, I gained more fascination with America.","I was definitely drawn to the mythology of one man, one voice, and one guitar.","I didn't know what to expect of real America. What shocked me was the diversity of it and how different every city is. But also just how polite and usually good-willed and optimistic most Americans are.","I'm not quite used to being seen through the eyes of fans yet. Being met with squeals and screams - I haven't gotten used to that.","It was amazing for me to even perform at the Grammys, but to do so alongside Annie Lennox was a truly incredible honor.","My hair grows into a fuzz ball - I just wanted it to grow downwards rather than outwards - but then I realized I couldn't play guitar with it that way. I couldn't do anything day-to-day without my hair getting in my mouth or my eyes or my food, so I just started tying it back, long before I knew what a man bun was.","One of my biggest influences of all time would be somebody like Tom Waits. David Bowie is another huge influence. I'm also a big fan of St. Vincent and Leslie Feist.","I have very strong feelings about a lot of things. I am sometimes reluctant to come straight to the forefront with it. You know, first and foremost, I'm a musician. I'm a songwriter.","I look at all good things with a bit of a dark lens, I suppose, especially with something like love.","Love isn't any one good thing; it's a very, very strange mishmash of emotions. Your love for somebody is, oftentimes, informed by the terrible things you might believe about yourself, and comparatively, the person you see them as is everything that you're not.","If you can say something beautiful in a very terrible way - I was always drawn to that.","I don't like false happy endings, and I don't think the real world is such a forgiving place.","I had a fascination with the roots of African American music. That would have been my first education in music. I had a real passion for it. I wanted to play it, sing it. I could sing at a young age, but I started to teach myself bass guitar and started writing when I was 15.","Someone had an eye on me as I was leaving high school. I had a chance to record demos, but they were kind of wanting to make a pop singer out of me, of the 'X Factor' variety. I didn't feel comfortable with it. I wanted to be a songwriter.","I am a politically motivated person, and that will come through in the music.","I'm not sure if every song will be 'Take Me to Church,' but I can only hope that people enjoy the body of work that I have ahead of me.","I was essentially raised on blues music. My dad was a blues musician around Dublin when I was a baby, so the only music I would listen to growing up was John Lee Hooker and Muddy Waters. It's music that feels like home to me.","When I write songs, I try to remove myself a little bit. Obviously, they're very personal to me, but it feels easier if I feel like I'm writing characters.","I'm influenced a lot by Nina Simone, Stevie Wonder, even Paul Weller - Billie Holiday as well: People who wrote and sang songs that were reflective of their times. I quite like that. I quite admire that.","To be honest, the biggest reason I write music and became a musician was to create the amount of joy that I felt about music to anyone else. To me, that's a job well done.","The best vocalists I can think of are female. There is no singer I can think of who can touch Ella Fitzgerald. And when Billie Holiday sings, she's merciless about it. Her voice has just this immaculate sadness - even in happy songs, there was something that was so broken about it.","I love the sound of voices singing together, congregational singing, anything like gospel, or folk, or sea shanties. I spent quite a bit of time in choirs growing up, and in the world-touring music group, Anuna. It's a sound with very rich texture, voices singing together.","I know I'm not the kind of music that's going to have tons of screaming fans, and I'm not gonna be everyone's cup of tea. I just want to do as good a job as I can.","I'm quite sure I don't want legions of 15-year-old girls who call themselves, like, Broziers or something. My career isn't going to be that kind of a thing.","It's kind of strange to hear your songs sung back to you! You get a big insight into what people connect to, what's moving to people or what songs people are really into.","I think it's very hard to write things about being joyful. I find that quite difficult. I think when you're happy, you don't want to write songs; you just want to enjoy being happy.","Religion wasn't imposed on me. I dabbled with faith, and I explored religion quite thoroughly.","We have such a culture of discrimination and hatred, and one that has scapegoats and affects people so extremely. That's something that very easily crosses borders.","I think all that we would know of America back home is foreign policy, and maybe the snippets of the madness of political culture.","You just feel like you're doing a job that you want to be doing, and then one day, somebody asks you a question like that: 'What's it like to be famous?' It doesn't really mean anything. The only difference is some people stop you and ask you for photographs.","Truth be told, I'm not all that comfortable with celebrity culture. That was always something that baffled me, the obsession over fame. I don't think that's a reason why anyone should get into making music.","The success of 'Take Me To Church,' I never imagined it. I never imagined that it would work on radio, that it would find its way onto the charts, even at home and certainly not in America.","Certainly in the case of having to answer questions about where a song comes from, it's a hell of a lot easier when you say, 'I've removed myself from it.' But they start from quite a personal place. They always do.","I am a politically motivated person, and that will come through in the music. I'm not sure if every song will be 'Take Me to Church,' but I can only hope that people enjoy the body of work that I have ahead of me.","Anyone close to me will be familiar with my frustrations with certain aspects of social media: the behaviour it encourages and attitudes towards the self it can breed.","Much of social media can be seen as the 'News of me.' It's not so much a platform for connecting and sharing as it is a platform for advertising the idea of yourself you want to portray to others: the image of yourself you want to project.","Governments do not care about your Facebook-assembled opinion. Incompetent politicians don't read your tweets; there are reasons for them being out of touch. Change does not come about for 'likes' on a page, though the ideas for it may start there.","No Facebook status is as worrying as a vote and no tweet is as noticeable as an angry cry from a crowd outside a government building.","When you play to an audience, you come away energized. It's the promo that really breaks an artist. Some lad sitting on a box trying to create a drum sound in a dry little studio. Everyone goes, 'Great - okay, now on with my day.' You go back to the bus, and you weep."],"Hrithik Roshan":["Life hits you hard. But it takes you three seconds to decide if you are a superhero or not. I am.","When truth is on your side, you don't need support.","Be patient. Patience is the mother of all virtues.","Whatever you are inside, the good and bad will manifest in the outside world. It will come out in some way. It will come out in your work. It will come out in words. It will come out.","If I'm walking down the street, and if a person abuses me, the dignified thing to do is to keep walking, but if that person starts throwing stones into my home and affects the well-being of me and my family, then that silence is no longer strength; that silence becomes weakness.","I've never let myself give up, because I believe in myself. I want to get stronger than I have ever been, and I will continue to tell myself that I can do it, no matter what the odds.","Love is not blind. Romance is. Romance is the most dangerous thing. Romance is like an illusion. It shows you things, and you hear things that don't exist.","I believe if you are not rediscovering yourself and pushing boundaries, then you are not alive.","I have been elevated to such a high status that the fall will be very steep.","If a film is good, it will work no matter what.","I take my time to get into the mindset of the character and say my lines. I really have to be the person that I am playing.","Fatherhood didn't just happen to me. I am deliberately living it, re-imagining it, and rediscovering it every day. It is as beautiful as I make it, just like anything else in life.","The world helps you to keep evolving and hope it's for better. You have to rise above all the tragedies in life. You have to grow, and if you stop growing, you are old.","I make the best Spanish omelettes in the world, but I won't tell you the recipe!","I can be the best James Bond there is.","It's not a prerequisite for an actor to be obsessed about his looks. I know there are people who don't look in the mirror at all, and I'm getting there.","I can't act, and so I have to live that particular character in my real life and then exhibit it on screen.","I don't consider myself a good actor.","I am not a confrontational person. I have never had a fight in my life - neither with a man nor a girl.","If you have a MacBook Pro, there is no option to block people. Believe me: I hunted for this blocking option.","I'm so curious about knowing the unknown; it can be scary, but I see it as a game.","When my kids love my work, I feel elated and victorious; it means more to me than an Oscar. And when they are silent, I'm proud that they have a mind and perspective of their own and are courageous enough not to say things just to please me.","People still get shocked when they see me eat a whole box of chocolates. I don't psyche myself out - I know how to balance my meals even when I am not on a strict diet.","After doing films like 'Krrish,' 'Bang Bang,' and 'Mohenjo Daro,' 'Kaabil' is one film where you can't lie at all. You can't be a hero. You have to be real. You have to be yourself. So that was a challenge.","I have played a mentally challenged person, a quadriplegic - but blind, I realised, is the most difficult because eyes are the most involuntary muscles in our body.

We will continue our efforts to promote democracy and the rule of law.","China and the United States have major influence in international affairs and shoulder important responsibilities in upholding world peace and promoting common development.","The world economy today is recovering slowly, and there are still some destabilising factors and uncertainties. The underlying impact of the international financial crisis is far from over.","China has been committed to the independent foreign policy of peace and has developed friendship and cooperation with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.","China will stay firmly committed to the basic state policy of opening-up. We will actively and effectively use foreign investment, improve its structure, diversify its form and open up more channels and sectors so as to facilitate investment.","We will make every effort with utmost sincerity to achieve a peaceful reunification of the country.","We will never allow anybody to separate Taiwan from China.","The monetary policy of the United States has a major impact on global liquidity and capital flows and therefore, the liquidity of the U.S. dollar should be kept at a reasonable and stable level.","China has made important contribution to the world economy in terms of total economic output and trade, and the RMB has played a role in the world economic development. But making the RMB an international currency will be a fairly long process.","China is a developing country with a huge population, and also a developing country in a crucial stage of reform. In this context, China still faces many challenges in economic and social development. And a lot still needs to be done in China, in terms of human rights.","Building a good, stable, and productive China-U.S. relationship is in our mutual interest of our two countries and our two peoples, and also contributes to peace and development.","We must clearly see that international hostile forces are intensifying the strategic plot of Westernizing and dividing China, and ideological and cultural fields are the focal areas of their long-term infiltration.","The overall strength of Chinese culture and its international influence is not commensurate with China's international status. The international culture of the West is strong while we are weak.","Only reform and opening up can develop China. We must not be afraid of any risks, and not be confused by any distractions.","Since the beginning of the 21st century, thanks to the concerted efforts of both sides, China-U.S. relationship has on the whole enjoyed steady growth. Since President Obama took office, we have maintained close contact through exchange of visits, meetings, telephone conversations and letters.","All foreign companies registered in China are Chinese enterprises. Their innovation, production and business operations in China enjoy the same treatment as Chinese enterprises.","The political restructuring we pursue in China is aimed at advancing the self-improvement and development of the socialist political system. We will continue to expand people's democracy and build a socialist country under the rule of law in keeping with China's national conditions.","At the same time, we are keenly aware that China is still the largest developing country in the world and we need to make long and hard efforts if we are to build a moderately prosperous society in all respects and basically achieve modernization.","Like other countries in the world, China must uphold its own sovereignty, territorial integrity and development interests. At the same time, we are willing to properly handle differences and disagreements in state-to-state relations.","China pays a great deal of attention to the Korean nuclear issue. We stand for achieving denuclearization of the peninsula in a peaceful way through dialogue and consultation to maintain peace and stability of the peninsula and Northeast Asia.","Global climate change has a profound impact on the survival and development of mankind. It is a major challenge facing all countries.","Developed countries should support developing countries in tackling climate change. This not only is their responsibility, but also serves their long-term interests.","China has adopted and is implementing its national climate change program. This includes mandatory national targets for reducing energy intensity and discharge of major pollutants and increasing forest coverage and the share of renewable energy for the period of 2005 through 2010.","In order to address world economic imbalances, countries around the world should make joint efforts to adjust their economic structure."],"Hu Shih":["And revolutions always mean the breakdown of old authority.","Another important historical factor is the fact that this already very simple religion was further simplified and purified by the early philosophers of ancient China. Our first great philosopher was a founder of naturalism; and our second great philosopher was an agnostic.","India Conquered and dominated China culturally for 20 centuries without ever having to send a single soldier across her border.","It is only through contact and comparison that the relative value or worthlessness of the various cultural elements can be clearly and critically seen and understood.","On the basis of biological, sociological, and historical knowledge, we should recognize that the individual self is subject to death or decay, but the sum total of individual achievement, for better or worse, lives on in the immortality of The Larger.","On July 26, 1916, I announced to all my friends in America that from now on I resolved to write no more poems in the classical language, and to begin my experiments in writing poetry in the so-called vulgar tongue of the people.","But I wish to point out that it is entirely wrong to say that the Chinese are not religious.","Historically, there had been many periods of Chinese Renaissance.","What is sacred among one people may be ridiculous in another; and what is despised or rejected by one cultural group, may in a different environment become the cornerstone for a great edifice of strange grandeur and beauty.","And lastly, the political revolutions from 1911 to the present time have done more to bring about tremendous social changes everywhere than even the economic and industrial changes and the new schools.","After learning the language and culture of the Chinese people, these Jesuits began to establish contacts with the young intellectuals of the country.","Confucius was a humanist and an agnostic.","For all the social changes in China can be traced to their early beginnings in the days when the new tools or vehicles of commerce and locomotion first brought the Chinese people into unavoidable contact with the strange ways and novel goods of the Western peoples.","In such diffused changes of culture two factors are necessary: contact and understanding.","In the year 1915 a series of trivial incidents led some Chinese students in Cornell University to take up the question of reforming the Chinese language.","It is true that the Chinese are not so religious as the Hindus, or even as the Japanese; and they are certainly not so religious as the Christian missionaries desire them to be.","Life and human society are the chief concern of Confucianism and, through it, the chief concern of the Chinese people.","No student of Chinese history can say that the Chinese are incapable of religious experience, even when judged by the standards of medieval Europe or pious India.","Only when we realize that there is no eternal, unchanging truth or absolute truth can we arouse in ourselves a sense of intellectual responsibility.","Practically all the prominent leaders of thought in China today are openly agnostics and even atheists.","The Chinese people, too, went through all kinds of vicissitudes in their religious development.","The Jesuits had learned that a Christian mission to China could never succeed if it were not in a position to show and convince the Chinese intelligentsia of the superiority of the European culture.","The rise of the dramas in the thirteenth century, and the rise of the great novels in a later period, together with their frank glorification of love and the joys of life, may be called the Third Renaissance.","Within my own life, I read all the beloved novels by lamps of vegetable oil; I saw the Standard Oil invading my own village, I saw gas lamps in the Chinese shops in Shanghai; and I saw their elimination by electric lights."],"Hubert Burda":["Journalists must not be made accomplices by the secret service to solve its own problems.","Davos is my university.","The 'spirit of Davos' has definitely achieved a thing or two.","Technologies that exist between man and nature in a simple form and those that enable the interaction with other technologies are becoming significantly more complex and create their own information systems.","Everything that exists is information, and everything that is informative also exists. The infosphere is not a virtual space that is distinct from the real world. Rather, the world itself is increasingly being considered an information space and part of the infosphere.","Younger generations in particular, who have spent a great deal of time in information environments since they were small children, would feel like a fish out of water if they were shut out of the global stream of information.","We are the only living creatures who can create a context, and as far as we know, everything else can only follow a context, without recognizing the context as such. Herein lies the source of creativity and the genuinely new.","When Arianna Huffington founded 'The Huffington Post' in 2005, a whole new era of journalism began.","Humankind is getting more and more connected.","The way communication works is changing.","Online advertising works, although it lands especially on search engines like Google and Yahoo. They achieve much higher revenues online than the websites of publishing companies.","Frank Schirrmacher's passing is a great loss. Among the intellectuals, he, along with Friedrich Kittler, was the only one who understood the philosophical dimensions of the Internet.","Almost no one wants to admit the genius of Jeff Bezos and Amazon. Apparently, many have failed to see that Amazon has become the world's biggest retail company.","The risk of pollution exists for the infosphere as it does for the atmosphere. Freedom of the infosphere should thus become a law, and the Bible needs to have an 11th commandment: Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's data.","A communication highway without content is inconceivable.","I think that the Internet and print behave in a complementary manner.","The mobile business in particular is something we must take seriously. I see tremendous prospects for all those transactions that can be handled on mobile phones.","Everything has gotten less expensive. Digitization has made content, whether it's print or music, less costly. Today, anyone can read the news for free online."],"Hubert H.

To blame someone else is politics.","Never give in and never give up.","Freedom is hammered out on the anvil of discussion, dissent, and debate.","It was once said that the moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped.","Behind every successful man stands a surprised mother-in-law.","To be realistic today is to be visionary. To be realistic is to be starry-eyed.","It is not what they take away from you that counts. It's what you do with what you have left.","There is in every American, I think, something of the old Daniel Boone - who, when he could see the smoke from another chimney, felt himself too crowded and moved further out into the wilderness.","Liberalism, above all, means emancipation - emancipation from one's fears, his inadequacies, from prejudice, from discrimination, from poverty.","The impersonal hand of government can never replace the helping hand of a neighbor.","Compassion is not weakness, and concern for the unfortunate is not socialism.","The President is the people's lobbyist.","For the first time in the history of mankind, one generation literally has the power to destroy the past, the present and the future, the power to bring time to an end.","Foreign policy is really domestic policy with its hat on.","This, then, is the test we must set for ourselves; not to march alone but to march in such a way that others will wish to join us.","National isolation breeds national neurosis.","The right to be heard does not automatically include the right to be taken seriously.","It is not enough to merely defend democracy. To defend it may be to lose it; to extend it is to strengthen it. Democracy is not property; it is an idea.","Never answer a question from a farmer.","Never give up on anybody.","Today we know that World War II began not in 1939 or 1941 but in the 1920's and 1930's when those who should have known better persuaded themselves that they were not their brother's keeper.","If there is dissatisfaction with the status quo, good. If there is ferment, so much the better. If there is restlessness, I am pleased. Then let there be ideas, and hard thought, and hard work. If man feels small, let man make himself bigger.","Propaganda, to be effective, must be believed. To be believed, it must be credible. To be credible, it must be true.","Leadership in today's world requires far more than a large stock of gunboats and a hard fist at the conference table.","The difference between hearsay and prophecy is often one of sequence. Hearsay often turns out to have been prophecy.","There are those who say to you - we are rushing this issue of civil rights. I say we are 172 years late.","In real life, unlike in Shakespeare, the sweetness of the rose depends upon the name it bears. Things are not only what they are. They are, in very important respects, what they seem to be.","There are incalculable resources in the human spirit, once it has been set free.","The essence of statesmanship is not a rigid adherence to the past, but a prudent and probing concern for the future.","A politician never forgets the precarious nature of elective life. We have never established a practice of tenure in public office.","I learned more about the economy from one South Dakota dust storm that I did in all my years of college.","I have seen in the Halls of Congress more idealism, more humanness, more compassion, more profiles of courage than in any other institution that I have ever known.","Anyone who thinks that the vice-president can take a position independent of the president of his administration simply has no knowledge of politics or government. You are his choice in a political marriage, and he expects your absolute loyalty.","The Senate is a place filled with goodwill and good intentions, and if the road to hell is paved with them, then it's a pretty good detour.","We are in danger of making our cities places where business goes on but where life, in its real sense, is lost.","American public opinion is like an ocean, it cannot be stirred by a teaspoon.","Each child is an adventure into a better life - an opportunity to change the old pattern and make it new.","There are not enough jails, not enough police, not enough courts to enforce a law not supported by the people.","I learnt more about politics during one South Dakota dust storm than in seven years at the university.","Unfortunately, our affluent society has also been an effluent society.","Freedom is the most contagious virus known to man.","Asia is rich in people, rich in culture and rich in resources. It is also rich in trouble.","The President has only 190 million bosses. The Vice President has 190 million and one."],"Hubert Selby, Jr.":["My writing is inspired by just about everything, yet I am unaware of so much of the process.","There are a lot of people in this country who really like my writing. And a lot of writers respect me. But the so-called establishment? They hate me.","I've always felt alienated. I realized that I've been terrified my entire life. So I can identify that fear which drives so many of the people that I write about.","I guess it could be said that the inspiration for 'Requiem for a Dream' is watching the American dream not only destroy so many lives in the U.S., but infect the rest of the world with its obsession with getting more, ignoring the deadly effect that has on the planet.","One of the things I have become aware of through the years is how much I love the people I write about.","I have rituals for cleaning out resentments, disappointments, heartbreak, depression and for work. One of the things I do is go over old stuff if I have been unable to write for a while."],"Hubert de Givenchy":["It gives you a good feeling. Each year, you rediscover in a garden the magic of life. A flower arrives, and it is a miracle. The leaves fall in the autumn, and it looks fantastic. There is a tenderness about a garden, and you can't help but be sensitive to that.","As time passes, we like to simplify our lives.","Like in great painting and architecture, in couture, to make clothes you must eliminate, eliminate, eliminate to obtain the true sense of a line. You see, the more you add, the more you load on, the more it's mad. You must try to have just the silhouette, which is an intelligence in clothes.","If you want to express yourself, it is difficult to be by yourself. You must have people around you who understand the same music. It is like being the chef d'orchestra. They need you, but you need them desperately.","To be a couture designer is not only to create dresses but to adapt your line to your private customers. It is why couture is expensive. You are like a doctor.","I love to dance, and I love to see people dance. It is good exercise. It gives you a kind of energy.","You never finish learning.","The little black dress is the hardest thing to realize because you must keep it simple.","Balenciaga was my religion. Since I'm a believer, for me, there's Balenciaga, and the good Lord.","It was always my dream to be a dress designer, and my mother accepted that decision.","You must, if it's possible, be born with a kind of elegance. It's part of you, of yourself.","Clients become very attached to the fitter who they feel understands them.","I haven't really got a green thumb, but I love gardens and their architecture.","Mine is one of the most beautiful professions in fashion: making others happy with an idea... I am happy because I did the job I dreamt of as a child.","Fashion should evolve slowly, without any revolution.","If I had to start over, I'll do the same thing: street clothes are the future; the client can choose two or three things and combine them as she wants.","A piece of material has a life. You must never upset it if you want the material to speak.","You have to know when to stop - that's wisdom.","I dreamed of fashion as a little boy.","I had this creativity always with this will for perfection, and I always said to myself, 'Look for what's best.' 'That's your goal, your driving principle.'","When you are a designer, what's important is to be aware of things. Everything should lead to an idea, a line to follow, a movement.","If fashion is good, it has no epoch.","In the early '50s, it was still the time of Christian Dior's New Look. Every dress was big and important, and I thought I must do something completely different. Women needed something for daytime that was wearable.","I didn't do any designs for 'My Fair Lady.'","I think all beautiful women have a clean look. They like things that are simple.","People say I am a classic designer. I don't try to be classic, but I do try to be simple and elegant.","To have lived your dream is very rare in life. I am a very happy man. I have been so fortunate.","Always I remember when I am young, I ask my mother, 'I really want to be a dress designer.' In that time, was quite difficult because, you know, my family always criticize me for it not to be a man's job.","You work around a body and adapt the clothes to your own customer, and this is the interesting part. This is why the haute couture exists: because in ready-to-wear, you have not too much fitting.","I really love to work like a machine.","American and Italian women stimulate designers to do new things.","When I am designing, I keep in mind more the American woman than the French woman.","I've stopped making frocks, but not making discoveries.","Life is like a book: one has to know when to turn the page.","Balenciaga taught me everything I know. He taught me to care for the details, that it was not necessary to sew on a button where it had no use or to add a flower to make a dress beautiful... no unnecessary detail.","Each of my garments is something special in itself. You give all your energy to each piece, to each creation, and I have no favourite. I love all of them equally.","It's the most beautiful job in the world to give happiness to people.","My mother was a beautiful lady, elegant, chic, and that was the biggest inspiration to me.","I don't think I am avant-garde. I made a lot of creations and created harmony with my fabrics, but I was not like Balenciaga, for example, although he was, of course, a great inspiration.","My grandmother had a cupboard where she kept her collections and textile samples of all sorts of things. When I had good grades, I could take out one piece of work to look at.","When you see the best of the best - when you see a Matisse or a Picasso - what interests you is the creativity and harmony.","I had the fortune to evolve at a time when fashion was very important, and women dressed themselves very well. A woman who dressed very well also had a husband who would have beautiful collections of art and decorative objects.","As a student, I was more gifted in history and geography. Things like arithmetic were not my strength.","It is important to work. It is important for my mind.","I'd love to wear the big pant, like I see on the street, or the blouson, but I'd look ridiculous. I'm not that shape. You must respect yourself.","To change just because of change, that is not my idea at all.","Of course everyone dreams of living in the 17th or the 18th century because of the costumes, but there were so many incommodities.","I am of tradition, but that doesn't mean I have an old outlook on life.","It's a fabulous thing to give life to fabric, to make something move well, the harmony of colour.","Fabric is the most extraordinary thing; it has life. You must respect the fabric.","I think when you sell your company and are no longer the master of driving it, it's quite difficult.","Encouragement helps you to go one step more, become better."],"Hudson Leick":["In high school, from age 15 to 18, I was saddled with the unfortunate nickname of 'Junk,' which doesn't do a lot for one's self-esteem.","When I did my first episode of 'Xena,' I told my parents this is the worst acting I've ever done.","As human beings, we can relate to our dark aspects and trying to overcome our dark aspects as Xena did."],"Hudson Stuck":["Walter, who had been in the lead all day, was the first to scramble up; a native Alaskan, he is the first human being to set foot upon the top of Alaska's great mountain, and he had well earned the lifelong distinction.","An hour or two spent in writing from dictation, another hour or two in reading aloud, a little geography and a little history and a little physics made the day pass busily.","A pupil is a great resource.","We took a straight course up the great snow ridge.","There can be no possible question that cold is felt much more keenly in the thin air of nineteen thousand feet than it is below.","The writer's shortness of breath became more and more distressing as he rose.","Before the reader turns his back upon the Grand Basin once for all, I should like to put a name upon the glacier it contains - since it is the fashion to name glaciers."],"Hudson Taylor":["If we are faithful to God in little things, we shall gain experience and strength that will be helpful to us in the more serious trials of life.","China is not to be won for Christ by quiet, ease-loving men and women... The stamp of men and women we need is such as will put Jesus, China, souls first and foremost in everything and at every time - even life itself must be secondary.","It is always helpful to us to fix our attention on the God-ward aspect of Christian work; to realise that the work of God does not mean so much man's work for God, as God's own work through man.","While salvation is a free gift, the 'winning Christ' can only be through unreserved consecration and unquestioning obedience. Nor is this a hardship, but the highest privilege.","We sometimes hear the argument, 'All the world' thinks this, or does that, given as a reason for our doing likewise; but that is an argument that should have no weight with the Christian, who is commanded not to be conformed to the world.","The good works of the unsaved may indeed benefit their fellow-creatures; but until life in Christ has been received, they cannot please God."],"Huey Lewis":["After 'Sports' came out in the fall of 1983, everything changed for me. Four of the album's singles became top-10 hits, and by the end of June in 1984, the album was No. 1 on the Billboard chart. It was quite a ride, and for the first time I had enough money to live the way I wanted.","I was in a vintage pub rock band called Clover in the 1970s.","Film is a lark to me - thank God I don't have to make a living from it.","I am deluded enough to think I can bring something to the table.","I don't tap dance, and I don't think you can learn to tap dance in three weeks at my ripe old age.","I know my choices will be creative so long as I follow my heart.","I may be the most recognizable name in the cast, but I can guarantee that I am not the most talented.","I was knocked out by the show, Chicago.","Our first record, 'Huey Lewis And The News', was seen by no one - it sold 25 copies.","Today, it's very tempting to create songs by cutting and pasting in the studio.","We had several hits in the States but probably only one big one in Europe. The crowds are smaller.","A lot has been written and said about why he was so great, but I think the best way to appreciate his greatness is just to go back and play some of the old records. Time has a way of being very unkind to old records, but Elvis' keep getting better and better.","I grew up in Marin County north of San Francisco, and in the 1950s and '60s it was a natural paradise.","In '87 - four years after 'Sports' was released - my family and I began vacationing in Montana. I soon bought my first piece of land in Ravalli County, in the western part of the state.","I don't have a formal home recording studio, but I can record tracks on my computer upstairs in my office.","Back in the day you wanted your albums to have a theme, and 'Sports' theme was really a collection of singles. It was really a record for its time.","In the '80s, the way radio was programmed, if you didn't have a hit record you weren't going to be able to make any more records. That was it, period.","Well, we were originally called Huey Lewis and the American Express. But on the eve of the release of our first record, our record label, Chrysalis Records was afraid that we'd be sued by American Express.","It's true, I do like cheering people up.","I got a very good life. I sold plenty of records, I get recognized plenty, I can always have somebody call up and get me a fine table at a restaurant. What do you really need, ultimately?","I am a Bay Area guy, no question.","When you get in the pocket, there is a place where the music begins to play itself. When you can find that spot, it's the best feeling in the world.","The choices I make - they have to be creative.","The choices for me now are completely creative. I know, when I'm going to make a record, it ain't going to sell.","I went to engineering school, I went to physics class. I said, 'Screw this, I don't want to be here. I'd much rather be at a club playing music.'"],"Huey Long":["Hard work is damn near as overrated as monogamy.","One of these days the people of Louisiana are going to get good government - and they aren't going to like it.","The time has come for all good men to rise above principle.","I do not want the voice of the people shut out."],"Huey Newton":["You can jail a Revolutionary, but you can't jail the Revolution.","Black Power is giving power to people who have not had power to determine their destiny.","We've never advocated violence; violence is inflicted upon us.

The young always inherit the revolution.","We have two evils to fight, capitalism and racism. We must destroy both racism and capitalism.","You can tell the tree by the fruit it bears. You see it through what the organization is delivering as far as a concrete program. If the tree's fruit sours or grows brackish, then the time has come to chop it down - bury it and walk over it and plant new seeds.","The policemen or soldiers are only a gun in the establishments hand. They make the racist secure in his racism.","The walls, the bars, the guns and the guards can never encircle or hold down the idea of the people.","My fear was not of death itself, but a death without meaning.","I didn't get trained by the school system like other kids, and when I did concentrate on learning, my mind was cluttered and locked by the programming of the system.","Sometimes if you want to get rid of the gun, you have to pick the gun up.","Malcolm X was the first political person in this country that I really identified with. If he had lived and not been purged, I probably would have joined the Muslims.","I do not expect the white media to create positive black male images.","No one can say, 'I have dropped out - I am no longer in the system.' When you're in prison, you're even closer to the system: you feel it more, and you might be in there for whatever reason. You don't transform the system as an absolute thing.","If you stop struggling, then you stop life.","I have the people behind me and the people are my strength.","I expected to die. At no time before the trial did I expect to escape with my life. Yet being executed in the gas chamber did not necessarily mean defeat. It could be one more step to bring the community to a higher level of consciousness.","There will be no prison which can hold our movement down.","The first lesson a revolutionary must learn is that he is a doomed man.","My mother and my father have been married 50 years, and he's just started to understand that something's wrong with the system. He accepted the whole thing, you see. Yet this industrious kind of engagement didn't bring him the success, according to American terms, that he wanted. I was probably affected by this very much. In fact, I know I was.","The first book I ever really read was Plato's 'Republic,' and then I had to go over that five times or something.","There's no reason for the establishment to fear me.

But it just makes your job a lot easier if you don't have to gird your loins, if that's not quite the right phrase, every time you're going to do a scene with that person.","The little song and dance number at the end - that's me, my voice, howling out. It was a new experience for me. I've never sung before and I've certainly never sung on screen. I think I sung on stage when I was 13 and for some reason nobody's asked me to try it again since.","I think for anybody reading the book they're going to get an idea in their heads of all those characters, and I think that once that gets fixed, it's quite hard to shake.","Well, fluffy shirts are, by definition, very comfortable.","But no, I don't think I'm particularly drawn to the period roles or the medieval roles.","In reality, for me every role is completely different.","I think I can lead a pretty anonymous life, yeah.","Ireland. Great for the spirit - very bad for the body.","As always, there's a couple of things in the pipeline - but that pipeline is a strange and ambiguous place.","No, I'm not a lager lout either. I think you have to be a massive football fan to be a lager lout.","I've not as yet found one hobby that would absorb me completely when I'm not working, but I have just bought a new apartment and didn't quite bargain for the amount of effort and time and money that that absorbs.","I knew I wanted to be an actor when I was growing up, really. So when I decided to go to university instead of drama school, it was with the intention of becoming an actor afterwards.","There's no one actor in particular that I want to model my career after, except for the people who have been able to keep their career varied and who choose things that interest them. That opportunity is all I really want.","When I got back I found myself being very emotional about the time spent in Rwanda in a way that I hadn't been able to or allowed myself to be when we were there.","Specifically, we talked about making the character of the prince not so charming, at least in the beginning, and I'm playing around with the preconceptions attached to a character. That's really what intrigued me as well because I thought it would be fun to do it.","Besides, most of the books I like involve people I could never play in a million years."],"Hugh Dillon":["Life is too short to spend in negativity. So I have made a conscious effort to not be where I don't want to be.","I am confident in who I am.","Long ago, I was lucky enough to shoot 'Flashpoint' and 'Durham County' at the same time. It doesn't happen often in an actor's life that you get two great parts simultaneously.","I had a great acting teacher in high school. But I didn't like acting because it took too many people to get the job done. You have to talk to too many people and listen to others' opinions. With music, you get a few friends together and just make it.","I'm very, very lucky to be a working actor, but I've also been careful. I don't just take anything. 'Durham County' came to me. You have to look at the quality of work you do, and 'Durham' set the standard. I wait for things that keep me really interested.","I have a repertoire of songs that I'm proud of, that I've written for my own band. When I do a cover, something that somebody else has written, I think about it very carefully before I sing that song. I have to really get behind it and understand it and like it. And that's how I pick roles. I don't want to play just anything.","Life's too short. It's got to be great.","I do like to do TV work when it's firing on all cylinders."],"Hugh Douglas":["I really had to create my own style, because it's kind of hard being a 6-1 defensive end. I'm really like 6-4 - really.","The word that best sums up this team is sacrifice.","Living in Ohio, I grew up an Oakland Raiders fan.","The biggest thing, I think, is to stay healthy and make the fewest mistakes, and then you can win... The margin of error is so small in the NFL, so if you can do those two things - keep your team healthy and make the fewest mistakes each Sunday - you have a good chance of going to the Super Bowl.","I have my meals delivered... you know what I like? Chicken and rice... But the problem with being a defensive lineman is, if we get out of hand with our eating, we balloon up to, like, 300-some pounds. So I really got to watch what I eat.","I have some flamboyant outfits. It wouldn't be me if I didn't. But I'm married now. I'm not allowed to wear those outfits."],"Hugh Downs":["A happy person is not a person in a certain set of circumstances, but rather a person with a certain set of attitudes.","I've always thought that the stereotype of the dirty old man is really the creation of a dirty young man who wants the field to himself.","I have no ego investment in being on the air. I don't knock others for whom that kind of attention is like oxygen, but I don't miss anything about it."],"Hugh Evans":["History shows that all protest movements rely on symbols - boycotts, strikes, sit-ins, flags, songs. Symbolic action on whatever scale - from the Montgomery Bus Boycott to wearing a simple wristband - is designed to disrupt our everyday complacency and force people to think.","America has a critical place to play in the end of extreme poverty.","Global poverty is the product of reversible policy failures overseen by politicians, past and present. The poorest of the poor don't vote in American or European elections. They don't make donations to political parties or hire lobbyists in D.C., London or Canberra.","The Global Poverty Project's mission is to stand up for the world's poorest people. We fight for the full funding of Millennium Development Goals and advocate meaningful change to government and corporate policies that block progress and entrench injustice.","Live Below the Line raises real money to help the world's poorest people, but it is also a symbolic demonstration aimed at highlighting - not replicating - the plight of the world's poor.","When I was 13, I did become a Christian. And so it was when I was 13, that I thought... I just... I really saw a good example in Jesus and how he was just so... such a tremendous radical love and service of the poor. I just thought, 'Man, why can't we all do the same?'","I really consider my goal is that, wherever I am in life, I want to be a social advocate."],"Hugh Grant":["I frequently dream of having tea with the Queen.","Basically, my life is so boring, it's embarrassing.","In 'The Sound of Music,' I was a von Trapp daughter in a white dress with a blue satin sash, and my line was, 'I'm Brigitta. I'm 12, and all I want is a good time.' I got a laugh. And I was so delighted, I laughed, too. Sadly, that's a problem I still have - onstage, I laugh hysterically at how funny I am.","Brexit was a fantastic example of a nation shooting itself full in the face.","My laziness is really profound. I'm really interested in where it comes from - it almost feels chemical. And we've all got ADD now, short attention span and all that.","It's really frightening, American food on the whole. That's what always strikes me, coming from Europe: There's just so much of it! Then you plop down in front of the TV and watch ads for Weight Watchers. 'Lose weight now!' Well, eat less!","I'm not a great believer in marriages as an institution, or even in very long term relationships. I'm not sure we're built that way.","A free press is the cornerstone of democracy; there is no question about that.","It's very true that you can be both selfless and selfish at the same time. What we tend towards, particularly in filmmaking, is this binary sort of, 'This is a good guy, this is a bad guy.' And I quite like the fact that life is a bit more complex than that.","I get very annoyed when people think I'm nice or diffident or a polite English gentleman. I'm a nasty piece of work, and people should know that.","I've certainly had a bad attitude to my job on many occasions. Not since 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'. I've been rather a good boy and really given it everything when I've accepted a part since then, because I've been given much better parts in films.","Well, you know I have an office, my film offices. So I know that syndrome. I fancy offices, so there must be something wrong with me. Even the window cleaner intrigues me. It's a very sexy environment.","I think there's something unromantic about marriage. You're closing yourself off.","I'm a terrible actor. I'm still learning. When I first started, I wish I knew then to trust myself more, really. I was in a terrible panic in the early part of my career.","I don't do much acting anymore anyway, and not to work for 20th Century Fox is really the least of my worries.","I don't hate L.A., but I'm nervous about becoming one of those people who has a ferocious interest in how films did at the box office that weekend and, you know, would want to meet for egg-white omelets in the morning.","I'm a laugh tart. I make no secret of that fact.","I'm not a hopeless romantic. I'm quite the reverse. I'm a nasty piece of work, an ego maniac.","I just don't believe in love at first sight anymore, even though I've based my whole career on the concept. In my experience, power, money and influence always attract the opposite sex. It's something that I've always exploited - with good results.","The reason I turn down 99% of a hundred, I mean a thousand, scripts is because romantic comedies are often very romantic but seldom very funny.","Strangely enough I'm better on a stage. I love that I feel like I blossom in front of a whole bunch of people.","I couldn't put my hand on my heart and say I think that being in a relationship is a natural state for a human being.","But when you're a celebrity, you discover that you're no longer the pursuer, but the one being pursued. That's one of the disappointments I have had since becoming a single man.","If you do too much acting in a lead part in a feature film where you're 40 ft. high, it's rather unattractive. You can see the acting. And it's actually the right thing to do to bring as much of yourself, I believe, to the part as you possibly can - to minimize the amount of theatrical stuff that you need to do.","When I finished my degree at Oxford, I went and acted for a bit. And I was appalling. And with each part, I thought, 'Well, that's embarrassing. I'd better do one more to show people I'm not that bad.' And, in fact, instead of a taking a year, that's gone on for 35 years.","Some newspapers in Britain have become closer to these kind of mafia families. They wield an incredible power. They choose our governments, they choose our prime ministers, and they live above the law.","My contemporary art collection began with just needing to put things on the wall. I was looking around my Victorian house thinking, 'What would be the coolest is contemporary art - it will make me look young and interesting.' I'm more than 80 percent skeptical of the whole thing.","If it's a choice between doing a film and not doing a film, I'd rather not. But then, you remember that you're supposed to be earning a living and that it's your career.","Courage is soldiers fighting on the front line, or people living on the bread line.","There was a phase in my career in my late 20s and 30s when I was doing strange, arty-farty Euro films that were, you could tell, never had much chance of any release anywhere in the world.","I used to dream about Gorbachev before he lost power. I'd go into a panic because I was meeting him, and I had nothing to wear. I'd ask my brother what to do, and he'd tell me to wear my dressing gown. I'd tell him I can't - it's too horrible. He'd tell me to wear his as well. So I'd meet Gorbachev wearing two dressing gowns.","But I just know from experience that accent wise, even if you're an accent genius, crossing the Atlantic is the hardest thing in the world either way.","For any new technology there is always controversy and there always some fear associated with it. I think that's just the price of being first sometimes.","With 2 movies opening this summer, I have no relaxing time at all. Whatever I have is spent in a drunken stupor.","The moral of filmmaking in Britain is that you will be screwed by the weather.","You know everyone loves to be the villain.","When I think about actors I know, I'd much rather hear about who they're shagging than what film they're doing next.","The truth is, I'd never seen a Cary Grant film. Since then I have watched his stuff and it's astounding, but I don't see any similarity between us. Except for the fact that I'm told he used to wear ladies' underwear, which is something I also do.","The only reason my work seems to be eclectic up to a certain period is because I was a failure as an actor.","Plus, teaching brings home to you very fast that you actually know nothing. I didn't realize that before.","Neither Elizabeth or I are keen to do a real-life couple on the screen. It's not very electric.","Most actors really love it, that's what they want to do. They burn to do it. And so they'll read a script and think, that's an interesting part. And because they love acting, that blinds them to the fact that the rest of it is pretentious nonsense, which it very often is.","I think that's the whole point of Bridget Jones. It's all about that it's okay to fail.","I think maybe in a way it gets worse because you come in with a real reputation and they've paid you lots of money and all that.","I find it hard to understand why Scorsese has never called. You know, given the natural menace I bring to the screen.","I don't think there's much point in putting me a deep, dark, heavy, emotional film because there are people who do it so much better than I do.","I don't have any particular burning desire to go back to being cuddly. Not really.","I cling to the fantasy that I could have done something more creative. Like actually writing a script, or writing a book. But the awful truth is that I... probably can't!","And I particularly like the whole thing of being boss. Boss and employee... It's the slave quality that I find very alluring.","And film acting is incredibly tedious, just by its nature. It's incredibly, mind numbingly slow.","Women are frightening. If you get to 41 as a man, you're quite battle-scarred.","I had Courtney Love's left bosom out of her dress on my plate in front of me. It was extraordinary. I didn't know where to look.","I don't particularly like babies. I don't mind them for about four minutes. That's my max. After that I can't quite see what everyone's fussing about.","If you have a smothering parent, the effect it can apparently have on a child is to give them, in equal doses, a sense of too much self-esteem, because they are mummy's little princess or prince, and low self-esteem. It affects future relationships.","I think I'm rather young and sprightly, but then you see pictures of yourself and think, 'Who is that old man?' and I realise I'm not as young as I thought I was.","I look at life and I see some very happy relationships, but I also see the vast majority as not being that happy.","I have no doubt that I'd be a marvelous father. Maybe not when they're tiny, but when they're a little bit older, I think I'd be rather good.","I'm horrible in the mornings. I'm grumpy.","I quite like Pilates now. I have a Pilates girl in every city.","I'm quite proud of some of the films I've done, but less for the acting than for the fact that they're unpretentious and entertaining. I'm proud of having made unpretentious choices.","I'm very unrelaxed doing a newspaper interview.","I'm a terrible vacillator; I can be sure of something one day and change my mind the next.","It's very rare in life to be sure about something - particularly when it's an issue.","I'm such a chronic relativist, I can't hold down a strong opinion about many things long enough.","As it is, I have a limited range as an actor - light comedy. I have never been a fan of romantic comedies, and yet that is what I have ended up mostly doing.","At home, I hardly ever leave London. I don't like the countryside in England.","Japanese women have always loved my films, even when no one else did. Ever since I made 'Maurice' in the 1980s, I've been getting hundreds of letter from Japanese girls. They definitely have a special place in my heart.","I always admire the French and the Italians who are very devoted to their marriages. They take them extremely seriously, but it is understood that there might be other visitors at 5 o'clock in the afternoon. You just never boast about. They never say anything, but that's what keeps marriages together.","Do I think human beings are meant to be in 40-year-long monogamous, faithful, relationships? No, No, No. Whoever said they were? Only the Bible or something. No one ever said that was a good idea.","It's always more fun to be an anti-hero. They're more interesting.","Theater has always been much more fun. You get a laugh, and it's really encouraging.","My mother was a teacher.","Something about teaching is curiously attractive, actually. I don't know what it is.","After I found that I had become an actor, slightly to my surprise, I did have some insecurity, and I did take some rather strange acting classes at a place called The Actor's Studio in London. I don't think they did me any good at all.","I'm quite jealous of my Scottish relations, in whose culture everyone, in a Jane Austen kind of way, got married very young, when you're too young to be cynical or jaded and just started having children.","I think marriage is only necessary if you've got children. It's quite nice for them.","The angry Scot is a cliche not without some foundation. That's the Lowland Scot - I'm a Highlander. We're particularly lovely and charming.","The emphasis in 'Notting Hill' was perhaps, I thought, slightly more on the romance than on the comedy. But I think 'Mickey Blue Eyes' is maybe slightly more on the comedy. And the tone on 'Mickey Blue Eyes,' it's a far sillier film.","'Notting Hill?' Does that poke fun at being British? Maybe it does. In 'Mickey Blue Eyes,' that's kind of the point: the clash of worlds, the unlikely combo of a respectable Englishman and a mob guy. If you take out the Britishness, you don't really have much.","My whole history of being an actor is unusual and slightly disgraceful because it should be something you burn to do.","I used to pre-rehearse everything and then bring my pre-rehearsed performance to the set. Now, I'm learning to let it happen in the moment. American actors are much better at that than British actors. If I knew how to trust myself, I would have been much more relaxed.","For a few years, I thought I was putting show business behind me. I was busy doing other things in life, particularly with politics. I was not out looking for films, really. I lost interest.","There were various turning points, but the main one at the beginning was that I was going off to do another degree in the history of art. I would have ended up as some art historian at Sotheby's or something.","I suppose after 'Four Weddings' I was very busy for a bit, and I imagined that was my career, but I never had that thing of, 'I'm burning to be an actor. If I don't act, I'm not alive.' I've never had that.","Like lots of people who say, 'I'm going to write a novel,' it's actually more comfortable to think I could write a novel than to discover that you can't.","Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of acting: character acting and lead acting. And in my life, to begin with, in the 1980s, it was all character acting. And then when, by fluke, through 'Four Weddings', I got into doing lead parts, it's a completely different thing.","A lot of actors look at scripts and think, 'How will this stretch me as an actor?' But I always thought, 'Do I want to turn the page? Is this going to make people laugh?'","Comedy is probably a way of dealing with anxiety. Sometimes it's a way of dealing with pain.","I think the part of my acting career where I've been more successful, I've been incredibly cushioned. People are much too nice to you. You go into politics, and people are absolutely brutal. You've got proper enemies, and they're vicious. It's very invigorating.","I get more satisfaction out of comedy stuff. I'm a laugh tart. I make no secret of that fact.","Throughout my life, whenever I thought I'm dancing welI, I'm not.","Although I'm largely doing other things in life, it's very nice occasionally to put my toe back in the waters of show business.","I certainly hated actors and, more importantly, they hated me.","I've got four houses in my street. I live in two, and the others are empty. I'll buy more as they come up, because I think it would be great to have the entire street.","I had a kiss with Raquel Welch's daughter - she was a very naughty kisser.","I've always dreaded the sea - in fact, I get terribly seasick.","I slightly lost my enthusiasm for most acting, but I've done some little bits and pieces - curiosities.","'The Lair of the White Worm' is quite a strange film. It's difficult to be good when you're saying lines that have been translated from Spanish to English by someone who speaks French.","All I know is for a number of years, if someone like me called police for a burglary, a mugging, or something happened to me, chances are that a photographer or reporter would turn up before a policeman.","I wasn't aware I was trading on my good name; I've never had a good name.","I don't want to see the end of popular print journalism.","This guy Simon Helberg, who's in 'Florence Foster Jenkins,' I might have been vaguely patronizing to him because he hadn't done films before. Gradually, you realize, not only is the guy a much bigger star than me, he's maybe the richest man I've ever met.","I was fat-shamed the other day on a British newspaper. The headline was 'Four Bellies and a Turkey Neck.' They weren't wrong. I looked shocking.","I have this absurd syndrome where I get these out-of-the-blue, pathetic panic attacks. It'll be in a very easy, simple scene when everything is going swimmingly, and then suddenly, bang, I'm shvitzing and can't remember my lines.","Frankly, I think I'm marvelous in rehearsal! Then you turn the camera on, and it gets stiff and tight. And then you trudge back to your trailer feeling sad. That's been my experience of film acting.","I've driven people mad on films that I've made - I want more takes; I want to try new lines. Then I want to interfere in the editing process, and I want to interfere in the advertising process - everything, everything. Pretty much Barbra Streisand in trousers, I am!","I have known a few good marriages, but very few. And others look to me like they're pretty miserable. I don't really think that's a recipe for happiness.","I dreaded the dance scene in 'Love Actually' more than having my teeth extracted.","I used to pre-rehearse everything and then bring my pre-rehearsed performance to the set. Now, I'm learning to let it happen in the moment. American actors are much better at that than British actors. If I knew how to trust myself, I would have been much more relaxed. Maybe I would have less gray hairs today.","I never meant to be in romantic comedies; it's just what ended up happening. But they are tricky, in a post-1960s sexual revolution way. It was easier when you couldn't have sex scenes: everything crackled very nicely. They're not easy.","I'm a great believer in eccentrically-shaped modern families. Because I've seen them work so well. And as long as everyone loves each other, it can work very well.","If every play was three weeks, I'd do lots of plays. It's just the idea of six months, I think, that might drive me a bit nuts.","Love scenes are extremely difficult. You're always within a millimeter of sentimentality and 'yuck.'","At my school, which was all boys, I played almost exclusively lady parts. When I say lady parts, I mean parts that were ladies. To actually play lady parts would be weird, even by English standards."],"Hugh Hardy":["I am an architect, first.","During the Second World War, nobody built any concert halls or theaters. After the war, Lincoln Center was a very brave project because all those architects had never built a theater before. We've learned a lot since then about the nature of materials and the isolation that's required.","I get very excited when I go to a show - there are all these people who don't know each another who've come together to celebrate this amazing ritual. The making of community that theater provides is quite profound.","I live in a loft in a building I designed, but for my dream house I'd get Frank Gehry, just to see what he'd do.","When I went to India, I became absolutely obsessed with the idea of building a hotel in India. I've never done a hotel, and I'd love to do public spaces in that culture.","Basically, New York housing is designed by formula, with lots of restrictions.","When I was in architecture school at Princeton, the worst thing you could say about someone was that they were eclectic.","Please, don't use a cornice as a doorstop. At least put it somewhere where people will have to look up at it. Architectural details really ought to be displayed in the same relation to the viewer as they were originally intended.","There was this enormous burst of sculptural creative juice in the nineteenth century, and all that stuff is just so decorative. Even in pieces cast from a mold, you get a more sensuous, handmade, individual sense from it.","Theater publicly reveals the human condition through appealing to both intellect and emotion. Architecture, whether lowly or exalted, can do the same."],"Hugh Hefner":["It's good to be selfish. But not so self-centered that you never listen to other people.","Life is too short to be living somebody else's dream.","Picasso had his pink period and his blue period. I am in my blonde period right now.","Surrounding myself with beautiful women keeps me young.","If you let society and your peers define who you are, you're the less for it.","I looked back on the roaring Twenties, with its jazz, 'Great Gatsby' and the pre-Code films as a party I had somehow managed to miss.","To pursue your dreams, to have them come true, to have made a difference, to have changed society, to have fought against powerful forces... that's a life well-spent.","In my wildest dreams, I could not have imagined a sweeter life.","'Playboy' was not a sex magazine as far as I was concerned. Sex was simply part of the total package; I was trying to bring sex into the fold of a healthy lifestyle.","You know, from my point of view, I'm the luckiest cat on the planet.","Sex is the driving force on the planet. We should embrace it, not see it as the enemy.","I don't have dinner parties - I eat my dinner in bed.","My parents are wonderful people and they instilled in me an idealism for which I'm grateful.","Could I be in a better place and happier than I am today? I don't think so.","I am in very good health. I've never felt better.","Someone once asked, 'What's your best pickup line?' I said, 'My best pickup line is, 'Hi, my name is Hugh Hefner.'","With the rabbit as our emblem, when we got to the point in 1960 of opening the first Playboy Club... one of our executives suggested the possibility of a bunny costume. We tried it out, and I made some modifications - added the cuffs and the bow tie and collar - and the bunny was born.","The notion of the single man began in the 1950's. The idea of the bachelor as a separate life was new and obscure.","Part of the concept behind the magazine was breaking barriers. And it wasn't just a sexual thing. It was racial and doing the things that were right. And in the process, that set 'Playboy' apart.","I have about 100 pairs of pajamas. I like to see people dressed comfortably.","It's hard to really compare new love and old love.","The major civilizing force in the world is not religion, it is sex.","It is women who have traditionally, historically been given non-human roles, perceived as simply the daughters of Eve, perceived as either Madonna or whore. And I think that it is the sexual revolution that plays one part in female emancipation.","I always say now that I'm in my blonde years. Because since the end of my marriage, all of my girlfriends have been blonde.","When 'Penthouse' and 'Hustler' came along, they confused what I was trying to do. Before they arrived, we were perceived as a sophisticated men's magazine.","Men's magazines in the period immediately after World War II were almost all outdoor-oriented. They were connected to some extent in the male bonding that came out of a war... And what I tried to create was a magazine for the indoor guy, but focused specifically on the single life: in other words, the period of bachelorhood before you settle down.","For me, the magazine was always the heart of what my life was all about, and the other half was living the life.","Living in the moment, thinking about the future, and staying connected to the past: That's what makes me feel whole.","Sex, and the attraction between the sexes, does make the world go 'round.","I looked back on the roaring Twenties - with its jazz, 'Great Gatsby,' and the pre-Code films - as a party I had somehow managed to miss. After World War Two, I expected something similar, a return to the period after the first war, but when the skirt lengths went down instead of up, I knew we were in big trouble.","I'm very comfortable with the nature of life and death, and that we come to an end. What's most difficult to imagine is that those dreams and early yearnings and desires of childhood and adolescence will also disappear. But who knows? Maybe you become part of the eternal whatever.","Creating my own world in a comic or selling my first penny newspaper aged nine was a way of gaining recognition and acceptance by my peers.","My first wife was a brunette, and Barbi Benton, my major romantic relationship of the early 1970s, was a brunette. But since the end of my marriage, all of my girlfriends have been blonds.","I'm not an active feminist: I'm an active humanist.","I think that retirement is the first step towards the grave.","The people who had the most impact on me when I was young were Freud and Darwin, but growing up I also had my film idols.","I was very influenced by the musicals and romantic comedies of the 1930s. I admired Gene Harlow and such, which probably explains why, since the end of my marriage, I've dated nothing but a succession of blondes.","The business end of business has never interested me.","Historically the Puritans left England to escape religious persecution, and they promptly turned around and started persecuting the people they didn't agree with - the scarlet letter A, and the stocks and the dunking board came from that. That puritanism is still there.","Being attacked by right-wing Christians did not bother me. Being attacked by liberal feminists did.","I'm never going to grow up. Staying young is what it is all about for me.","I'm actually a very moral guy.","I was an absent dad. Once the magazine started, I really had two families. The dream was the magazine. I worked through the night all the time.","Men project their fantasies onto me; they live them through who they think I am.","Ageism is a variation of racism or sexism, all the other isms.","I guess I'm the most successful man I know. I wouldn't trade places with anybody in the world.","The interesting thing is how one guy, through living out his own fantasies, is living out the fantasies of so many other people.","I remain very much connected to my childhood... I have never been too jaded or too sophisticated.","I have no plans to retire. It's the perfect combination of work and play that keeps you young. If I quit work it would be the beginning of the end for me.","The difference between Marilyn Monroe and the early Pamela Anderson is not that great. What's amazing is that the taste of American men and international tastes in terms of beauty have essentially stayed the same. Styles change, but our view of beauty stays the same.","I think getting married was a mistake along the way, but at the same time I wouldn't have the wonderful children I have if I didn't get married.","My folks were raised pure prohibitionist. They were very good people, with high moral standards - but very repressed. There was no hugging and kissing in my home.","People get their information in different ways now. And we are a little poorer for it, because the way you get information affects what you learn.","I have very strong theories about magazine publishing. And I think that it is the most personal form of journalism. And I think that a magazine is an old friend.","When I was four, we moved to the house on the west side of Chicago where I grew up. My earliest memories are of that first summer.","What's amazing is that the taste of American men and international tastes in terms of beauty have essentially stayed the same. Styles change, but our view of beauty stays the same.","The difference between Marilyn Monroe and the early Pamela Anderson is not that great.","In my own words, I played some significant part in changing the social-sexual values of our time. I had a lot of fun in the process.","The Westwood Cemetery is just a few blocks from my home, and a number of my very dear friends are buried there.","One of the problems with organized religion is that it has always kept women in a second-class position. They have been viewed as the daughters of Eve.","I got married before I found myself. People should find themselves before they get married.","I guess you could say, I'm just a typical Methodist kid at heart.","I have been married twice, and those were not the happiest times of my life. Part of the problem, quite frankly, is that when you get married, the romance disappears and the children arrive and the love is transferred. It shouldn't be that way, but too often it is transferred to the children.","The whole 1950s notion was find the right girl, get married, move to the suburbs and then hang out with the guys while she stayed home with the babies. I felt that was sort of sad.","I separated ways from the American feminist movement when they became anti-sexual. I believe embracing sexuality is a part of what it means to be free.","There's almost a Rorschach-test quality about writing about 'Playboy'. What comes out in the press is not so much about me as it is about society.","I was writing and cartooning and writing short stories from grade school on.","My mother loaned me $1000. The first issue came out at the end of 1953. I knew I needed something original. I had a photographer shoot a 3D feature for the first issue and learned it would cost too much money. When the 3D thing turned out to be too expensive, at that same moment I came across the photos of Marilyn Monroe.","What made the magazine so popular was, even before I started writing the philosophy, there was a point of view in the magazine.","The women's movement, from my point of view, was part of the larger sexual revolution that 'Playboy' had played such a large part in. The reality is that the major beneficiaries of the sexual revolution are women.","There were chunks of my life when I was married, and when I was married, I never cheated. But I made up for it when I wasn't married. You have to keep your hand in.","The women's movement kind of came out of left field in the 1960s and 1970s when they turned on 'Playboy.'","If I ever try to get married again, shoot me.","Even when I was young, I said age is largely a state of mind if you're healthy.","I think everyone should get married. I just took a little longer than usual."],"Hugh Hopper":["Like all tools, modern technology has produced some wonderful moments in music and also some horrors.","Generally, I've got to say that all sounds, musics, noises since conception are bound to have influenced me.","Of course, there are many, many musicians whose music gives me pleasure, but until I make contact with them, musically or personally, I never assume that anything wonderful will happen.","Always think that in any area of the arts, you get maybe ten percent of people who are creative, original... and the rest are generally following on, copying.","I'm no mathematician, so I'm stuck with the graphic representations."],"Hugh Howey":["Ever since I was twelve, I dreamed of being an author. I just never had the fortitude to see any of my stories through to completion. I would start a book, get a few chapters in, and grow bored or get distracted by something else.","One of the many things that surprised me about 'Wool' is how many of its fans don't consider themselves science fiction readers.","I'd rather excite the imagination of a legion of readers and make pennies from each of them than hold off for a larger chunk of change from only a handful of fans.","There are two competing philosophies in 'Wool': one is that people have to live under an iron thumb in order to survive, and the other one is that everyone should live completely freely and happily and everything will sort itself out.","I'm such a huge fan of fan fiction, to me it's a great way for readers to become writers. It's like putting the training wheels on for writing.","Honestly, I don't think I'm a good promoter. I spend almost zero time or effort asking new readers to sample or purchase my work. That's not the job of the author. We should write our best material and leave it up to readers to spread the word.","My approach with social media is to interact with the readers I already have. I do it mostly to procrastinate from my writing. It's an escape. It's the only socializing I get outside of my wife, and she gets sick of me."],"Hugh Hudson":["With unknown actors, you look at them afresh. It's a very powerful element.","It's much more straightforward to get finance when you have an Oscar."],"Hugh Jackman":["When I come home, my daughter will run to the door and give me a big hug, and everything that's happened that day just melts away.","To me, the smell of fresh-made coffee is one of the greatest inventions.","I love food, all types of food. I love Korean food, Japanese, Italian, French. In Australia, we don't have a distinctive Australian food, so we have food from everywhere all around the world. We're very multicultural, so we grew up with lots of different types of food.","Meditation is all about the pursuit of nothingness. It's like the ultimate rest. It's better than the best sleep you've ever had. It's a quieting of the mind. It sharpens everything, especially your appreciation of your surroundings. It keeps life fresh.","There comes a certain point in life when you have to stop blaming other people for how you feel or the misfortunes in your life. You can't go through life obsessing about what might have been.","I had a fairly enlightened dad, though if you looked at his resume, it might not seem that way. He was a chartered accountant for Price Waterhouse. He was strict, and we had a very ordered life. To this day, I am the least materialistic person I know, because my father didn't raise me to just go out and buy this or that car.","Becoming a father, I think it inevitably changes your perspective of life. I don't get nearly enough sleep. And the simplest things in life are completely satisfying. I find you don't have to do as much, like you don't go on as many outings.","I've always felt that if you back down from a fear, the ghost of that fear never goes away. It diminishes people.","With age, you see people fail more. You see yourself fail more. How do you keep that fearlessness of a kid? You keep going. Luckily, I'm not afraid to make a fool of myself.","Singing is incredibly physical.","I had spent some time in the outback, but to meet Aboriginals and work with them was wonderful. It gave me a great appreciation of how tough life is and about the indomitable spirit that the Aboriginal people have always possessed.","The secret to modern life is finding the measure in time management. I have two kids, career and I travel, and I don't think my life is any different than most couples. The most valuable commodity now for many people is time and how to parcel that out.","The word philosophy sounds high-minded, but it simply means the love of wisdom. If you love something, you don't just read about it; you hug it, you mess with it, you play with it, you argue with it.","There is anxiety, but it comes after you've finished filming because it's out of your hands; people are editing it, they're cutting it, marketing it. And it's... part your career sort of rides on that. But when you're actually filming it's a team thing and it really feels good there for me.","I like to dress up in a tailored suit from time to time, and there's a tailor I go to in Naples who's fantastic. But if I told anyone his name, I'd have to kill them.","My father is a real idealist, and he's all about learning. If I asked for a pair of Nikes growing up, it was just a resounding 'No.' But if I asked for a saxophone, one would appear and next day and I'd be signed up for lessons. So anything to do with education or learning, my father would spare no expense.","Being on Broadway is the modern equivalent of being a monk. I sleep a lot, eat a lot, and rest a lot.","If I'm a lush at anything, it's food and drink. I'm not materialistic in any way, but I value food.","I always felt love from both my parents.","For me that's one of the great indulgences in life - a hand-tailored suit, and a great pair of handmade shoes.","What I respect as far as in myself and in others is the spirit of just doing it. For better or worse, it may work and it may not, but I'm going to go for it. Ultimately I probably prefer to be respected for that than whether it works out or not, either winning or losing.","I would love to have a robot at home.","Comic book fans have loved Wolverine, and all the 'X-Men' characters, for more than the action. I think that's what set it apart from many of the other comic books. In the case of Wolverine, when he appeared, he was a revolution really. He was the first anti-hero.","Sometimes you have to go places with characters and emotions within yourself you don't want to do, but you have a duty to the story and as a storyteller to do it.","I'd sell my soul for a good cause.","Australians are coffee snobs. An influx of Italian immigrants after World War II ensured that - we probably had the word 'cappuccino' about 20 years before America. Cafe culture is really big for Aussies. We like to work hard, but we take our leisure time seriously.","The most scared I'd ever been was the first time I sang at a rugby match, Australia versus New Zealand, in front of one hundred thousand people. I had a panic attack the night before because people have been booed off and never worked again... just singing one song, the national anthem.","It dawned on me that acting was what I wanted to do with my life. Nothing had ever touched my heart like acting did.","I remember at one point being in fellowship, and everyone used to wear the fish symbol; it said you were a Christian. So I asked my father, 'Dad, why don't you wear that at work?' And he said, 'Your religion should be in your actions.' He set a great, great example.","I got hooked on espresso when I visited Italy at 18, but these days I prefer a 'flat white.' It's like a small latte with less milk - they're popular in Australia.","I can look back on my life, where there have been moments where things might have gone the other way. Everything is like stepping stones, and I've seen people I admire falter. We're all vulnerable.","I've always felt embraced by the Broadway community even before I felt like I earned it.","Now I meet people with full-color Wolverine tattoos on their backs. Thank God I did okay, because I think if I hadn't, they'd spit on me in the street.","For Sunday breakfast, I make orange and ricotta pancakes, crepes and eggs. You know men, we usually go for breakfast because it's the easiest thing to cook and then we try to make it seem fancy.","My father is very Jean Valjean. He's what I would call a great example of a religious person. He is a deeply thoughtful man whose religion is in his deeds way more than anything else. It's not talked about that much.","Breakfast is my specialty. I admit it's the easiest meal to cook, but I make everything with a twist, like lemon ricotta pancakes or bacon that's baked instead of fried.","When I made 'Real Steel,' the director actually had the robots in the monitor, so he knew where everything was. So technically, there's been advancements. But at the end of the day, movies are about story and characters, so all the other stuff is great, but unless you have those two elements, then you've got nothing.","To this day, I am the least materialistic person I know, because my father didn't raise me to just go out and buy this or that car. The only reason I wanted to make money as an actor was because I'm passionate about food!","But anyone who's done a musical knows; whether you're dancing or not, physically it's the most difficult thing you can do.","I have a terrific marriage, but unlike a lot of relationships where they ebb and flow, no matter what happens you fall deeper and deeper in love every day. It's kind of the best thing that can happen to you. It's thrilling.","When you dance, your body just wants to find its natural weight. I'm naturally a lot more Tommy Tune than I am Wolverine.","There was a whole display set up of all the X-Men paraphernalia. My wife couldn't resist telling this 5-year-old boy that I was Wolverine. The little kid looked up at me and he was staring at me.","Americans are the most generous country on the planet. I've worked in Europe, I've worked in Australia. There is no where else where you get absolutely no attitude for being a foreigner. If you do your job well, they embrace you.","I'm an actor who believes we all have triggers to any stage of emotion. It's not always easy to find but it's still there.","I know I'm not known as method. By nature I'm not a brooder. What I continue to use is a mixture of the English school, which is traditionally outside-in, and the more American way of working from the inside out.","I'm doing 'Les Miserables,' the movie. I've done a lot of musicals and a lot of movies, and I know there are not a lot of people in Hollywood who have been down those two paths so I've been like, 'Come on, let's do a movie/musical.'","As you get older you have more respect and empathy for your parents. Now I have a great relationship with both of them.","I'm always very nervous about the word 'dancer' next to my name because anyone who's really trained in dance will go, 'This guy's fudging so badly.'","One afternoon when I was 9, my dad told me I'd be skipping school the next day. Then we drove 12 hours from Melbourne to Sydney for the Centenary Test, a once-in-a-lifetime commemorative cricket match. It was great fun - especially for a kid who was a massive sports fan.","I just find the evangelical church too, well, restrictive. But the School of Practical Philosophy is nonconfrontational. We believe there are many forms of Scripture. What is true is true and will never change, whether it's in the Bible or in Shakespeare. It's about oneness.","Because I believe actually the more you do something, the less frightening it becomes because you start to realize the outcome is not as important as you think.","I was probably more scared of my high school exams than I was of the Oscars. At the time you think it's everything and if you don't do well, your life's over. Opportunities are gone. So the more you do it, the less the fear is present.","When lifting, I'm always with a trainer because the thing that makes a difference is that last 20% in your training, and he very scientifically looks after my food as well, because when I'm going for a 'shirt off' shot, everything changes the month before, and I'm timed down to the day.","To get down to the quick of it, respect motivates me - not success.","It's absolutely physically demanding to play the role of Wolverine. There's a lot of action, and I try to do as much of it as I can because it's better for the audience.","I have a wife and a son, but the gay rumors have started. I guess it's a sign that I'm moving up the ladder.","I just love making a fool out of myself. I made my living as a clown at kids' parties for about three years.","I'm a big goofball, you know. Don't tell anyone that, but I'm a big goofball. In Australia we call it a dag.","I'm not a kid. You don't get in this business for anonymity. It's not like I have posters of myself on the wall, but at the same time, I'm kind of ready for a little bit of it, but I worry for my little one, and my family - their privacy. That's what I'm more protective of.","My agent said to me five years ago, 'Hugh, I can see one day you... if I had to plan a goal for you, it's for you to have the kind of career that Sinatra had.'","I'm not doing Bond.","My friends say, 'Man you're going to have kids sleeping on pillowcases with your face on it! You're going to be on toothbrushes and magnets and stuff.' I guess now that I'm a dad, I'm thrilled about that.","We feel that there are so many kids who need adopting. We thought we'd do it after having a couple of our own, but we just changed our mind.","When you're playing an icon like Wolverine, it's sometimes better to be someone that nobody knows because they don't know what to expect. I don't mind a little bit of anonymity; it helps on the subway.","The activity of being a husband, a father - those are roles, too, but underneath them is the spiritual center that connects us all, and that's what's most important.","Now I meditate twice a day for half an hour. In meditation, I can let go of everything. I'm not Hugh Jackman. I'm not a dad. I'm not a husband. I'm just dipping into that powerful source that creates everything. I take a little bath in it.","You have to eat before you train. Otherwise, that really intense training, after about 40 minutes you start to flag.","My kids are not that interested in my movie career, by the way. My son, in particular, never talks about it. He just wants me as his dad.","I find that kid actors are great reminders of the simplicity of acting. As you get older, you can sometimes complicate things a little more. You can become too aware of, 'Okay, this is the scene emotionally. This is where we need to be. We've got the climax coming up.' You can start to analyze it too much.","If you ask my wife, the biggest fault is my inability around the house. She says the only thing handy about me is that I'm close by. And, I have a terrible memory. I'm bad at saying no. I often double-book. There are a lot of things.","As an actor, you have many tools - your body, your voice, your emotions, mentally. In film, you have your eyes because they communicate your thought process. In fact, generally in film, what you don't say is more important than what you say. That's not so much the case for stage.","The last 10 years I have had to bulk up for roles and I'm naturally skinny, so I have eaten and killed so many chickens! I wouldn't even want to count. I need to balance that out.","I was brought up in a way that when you're at a dinner party, you don't grab a chip unless it's been offered to everyone else. It's the manners of being brought up by English parents.","I'm quite an independent person, and I had to be. As a boy and growing into a young man I had to look out for myself. And now I'm very family-oriented. It's a big priority in my life.","The moment your kid's born you realize no one knows anything. No one goes to classes. You just have a kid. You can read all the books you like, but unfortunately none of our kids have read the books so they don't care. You're basically making it up as you go along.","I've never heard my dad say a bad word about anybody. He always keeps his emotions in check and is a true gentleman. I was taught that losing it was indulgent, a selfish act.","One of things I'd love to do one day is a Shakespeare with Trevor Nunn. I've done musicals with him, but never Shakespeare. There's no one better.","I like the Rolling Stones for karaoke. 'Sympathy For The Devil' is a great one.","If I go to a party I don't feel like I have to be in the centre. But I do find myself quite often being placed in that position. Even when I was younger at school, I would be asked to make a speech. I don't remember putting up my hand and all that often but I'd just find myself there.","The first show I ever did, singing and dancing, was 'Beauty and the Beast.' I was playing Gaston. Gaston has red tights, knee high boots, and it's very physical. I had headaches every day for two months.","I once sang 'Summer Nights,' from 'Grease,' at a bar in Melbourne with John Travolta, who's a good friend of mine. He looked cool singing the part of Danny - sitting in an armchair, smoking a cigar - while I got stuck playing Sandy.","Your wife is always right. Very simple. I think I'm going to get it tattooed on my forehead.","I'm lucky to have worked in theater all over the world, but there's something magical about Broadway. The audiences are smart, they're educated. They go in ready and they're up for it, they're up for the party. It's a whole different atmosphere.","Both my parents are English and came out to Australia in 1967. I was born the following year. My parents, and immigrants like them, were known as '£10 poms.' Back then, the Australian government was trying to get educated British people and Canadians - to be honest, educated white people - to come and live in Australia.","My parents were drawn to the idea that there was space and opportunity in Australia. For the meagre sum of £10, you could sail your entire family out to Australia, so that's what my father chose to do.","I'm doing a new musical on Broadway, which opens in October called 'The Boy from Oz,' where I play Peter Allen. For those of you who don't know, he became first famous in America for marrying Liza Minelli.","I never wanted to go longer than five years off the stage. Not necessarily musicals, but just doing a play or something.","In terms of theater, there's not a more supportive theater community than in New York. It's really kind of a real thrill to go there. I mean, don't forget, I'm a boy from the suburbs of Sydney, so getting to New York is a huge, huge thrill.","It's always interesting - how do you actually convey thought through song? We're used to the convention on stage. In film, we used to be used to it, and now sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. You need to be fresh and really look at the material.","To make films like 'X-Men' work commercially - and also have some class - is one of the hardest things there is to do. I want to be seen to be able to cross lots of genres and still be 'fair dinkum,' as we say in Australia, which means genuine and true and, well, unique.","My favorite play in drama school was 'The Bacchae.' It's about a king who literally gets eaten alive by all the women in the play in a kind of orgy - it's related to the word 'bacchanal' - and I loved that idea of animalistic chaos and following our own desires.","At which point should we let go and do what we want to do, and when should we submit to rules? Coming to terms with our true natures and who we really are has always been a fascination to humans. I know it fascinates me.","And I think that, of course, there is some dysfunction of needing to be liked or noticed or to feel part of things, something going on there for most actors. For some there's not and I think they really struggle with it.","I'm a mad lover of sport. You cannot say a bad word to me about sports. So I know business is involved and I know it can be cynical, and, of course, I watch it, but for me it's pure.","My father was an army champion boxer... in the British army. And so he loved boxing and talked it up as a sport. But then when my brother and I were beating the crap out of each other, he was always trying to tone it down. But I am a fan of boxing.","I have done many movies that people hadn't seen. 'The Fountain,' I spent a year on that. 'The Prestige' with Chris Nolan, and 'Australia.' From my perspective it's very satisfying. Some movies people see and other movies they don't. 'Wolverine,' 'X Men,' I know that in some level people know me just for that and it's fine for me.","I don't think many actors are the best judge of careers. I think generally we have good instincts about what we can do in terms of acting. And often they become directors, which I don't want to be.","I have lots of older siblings, and as they started to leave the house, I went from cooking once a week to twice, three times, and so on. After a while, it was just like making the bed.","Acting is something I love. It's a great craft that I have a lot of respect for. But I don't think it's any greater challenge than teaching 8-year-olds or any other career. In my life, I try not to make it more important than it is and I just hope that rubs off on the people around me.","As a boy, I'd always had an interest in theater. But the idea at my school was that drama and music were to round out the man. It wasn't what one did for a living. I got over that.","Actually, I graduated from university as a journalist.","At the end of drama school, I made a contract with myself: I'd try acting for five years. I was 26. I had already spent eight years working in restaurants and gas stations. So I had seen enough small businesses to understand that that's what acting is: a small business.","By nature I'm not a brooder.","I had a bad back for a couple of years. I had to do a lot of physiotherapy for it. What I couldn't understand at the time was why the therapists had me doing a lot of stomach work.","I've dreamt of being in a movie musical for a long time. For some reason I never even thought 'Les Mis' would be possible.","I have two kids, career and I travel, and I don't think my life is any different than most couples. The most valuable commodity now for many people is time and how to parcel that out.","One thing I do personally started 20 years ago. I started meditating, and I know twice a day I can kind of let everything drop. It's just about being quiet, like drawing back the day, and it allows me to have energy.","But in another world, another life, probably growing up in another country, I might have been more of a dancer.","Salvatore Ferragamo have done some nice handmade suits for me.","That's all about the natural order of things, the idea of nature protecting children but also children protecting nature.","I have two children and it's amazing how in tune they are with nature, with light, with smells, with time.","Coming to terms with our true natures and who we really are has always been a fascination to humans. I know it fascinates me.","I'm quite a competitive person, so I do quite like to win.","I'm not a loner at all.","I feel so lucky to have both a son and a daughter, because there's a different relationship with each of them.","My gosh, I love food. If I wasn't an actor, I could be a completely different body shape right now.","I lived with a coffee farmer called Dukale on a trip I made with World Vision to Ethiopia, and realised there's no good reason for the disparity in opportunity around the world.","My dad's main client was the World Bank, and he spent most of his time traveling to Third World countries. His particular interest lay in the eradication of poverty through development and business.","I wanted to be a lawyer. Then a journalist. Actually, I graduated from university as a journalist.","Anyone who thinks they're indispensible is fooling themselves.","My mum and I are, in many ways, quite similar. We're both creative, gregarious, and energetic.","If I could only do one exercise, it would be dead lifting. For cardio, I dance, I ride my bike, I run and I have kids. There is a... lot of cardio just from being a parent.","I do heavy weights in the morning for about an hour, and then I do 45 minutes of higher-volume lifting in the afternoon. My least favorite is the legs... I do quite a few chin-ups and rows. I do mostly old-school lifting with a lot of squats."],"Hugh Kingsmill":["Friends are God's apology for relations.","Bacon's not the only thing that's cured by hanging from a string.","Society is based on the assumption that everyone is alike and no one is alive."],"Hugh Laurie":["Driving a motorcycle is like flying. All your senses are alive. When I ride through Beverly Hills in the early morning, and all the sprinklers have turned off, the scents that wash over me are just heavenly. Being House is like flying, too. You're free of the gravity of what people think.","I think good-looking people seldom make good television. And American television studios almost concede before they start: 'Well, it won't be good, but at least it'll be good-looking. We'll have nice-looking girls in tight shirts with F.B.I. badges and fit-looking guys with lots of hair gel vaulting over things.'","I grew up with an impatience with the anti-scientific. So I'm a bit miffed with our current love affair with all things Eastern. If I sneeze on the set, 40 people hand me echinacea. But I'd no sooner take that than eat a pencil. Maybe that's why I took up boxing. It's my response to men in white pajamas feeling each other's chi.","I am a coffee fanatic. Once you go to proper coffee, you can't go back. You cannot go back.","Ideas are 10 a penny. It's the execution that's the hard thing to do. House is standing up against a tide of sentiment and emotionalism over reason that threatens to engulf this world. When you think about it, a rationalist, a man of science and reason, is in a pretty lonely position.","It's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to make a blues record.","I'm finding it increasingly difficult to simply walk down the street. In New York, I dashed in to buy a big pair of sunglasses to conceal myself, but the guy behind the counter shouted 'Hey! It's Dr. House.'","I think pain is a very - it's an extremely hard thing to empathize moment to moment. And you often don't remember your own pain, you know, that moment that you broke a limb or you burned yourself or, I think, this is a common thing that women talk about with childbirth, that the memory of the pain is hard to summon up and relive, thankfully.","Muddy Waters, I suppose, was my first great hero. You know, every boy wants to be a guitar player, and Muddy Waters was just the king. He was the King Bee. He was it.","Riding my motorcycle around L.A. is like my own video game. But unlike many folks at the wheel, I am occupied with getting where I'm going and keeping myself safe. Most people are applying makeup, texting, and checking out the beauty in the next car.","As a real person, he wouldn't last a minute, would he? But drama is about imperfection. And we've moved away from the aspirational hero. We got tired of it, it was dull. If I was House's friend, I would hate it. How he so resolutely refuses to be happy or take the kind-hearted road. But we don't always like morally good people, do we?","I run six-to-eight miles a day, plus weights and aerobics in the lunch hour. I also lie a lot, which keeps me thin.","I get anxious about a lot of things, that's the trouble. I get anxious about everything. I just can't stop thinking about things all the time. And here's the really destructive part - it's always retrospective. I waste time thinking of what I should have said or done.","Humility was considered a great virtue in my family household. No show of complacency or self-satisfaction was ever tolerated. Patting yourself on the back was definitely not encouraged, and pleasure or pride would be punishable by death.","I'm reasonably easygoing. Messing up my lines or making a fool of myself is where you find my fears. Like a lot of English people, I'm prey to embarrassment - the dread that everyone's sort of sniggering at you, that you're going to look like an idiot. I think that sort of halts us all.","One great benefit of not being on TV every week is that people will be a lot less interested in what I have in my supermarket basket. I could even un-tint my car windows - or at least opt for a lighter shade.","I think actors are attracted to the idea of other identities and concealing themselves behind some other identity.","I have been instrumental in banning bottled water on the set. It hasn't gone that well with the crew... so I replaced it with tequila.","L.A. runs on optimism, enthusiasm and flattery. I think you can go a little bit crazy. I've heard people say there's a limit to the number of years you can stay in this city without going slightly mad. It's just too damn sunny in every dimension - weather-wise, socially and professionally.","I don't have a single complete show or movie or anything else that I could look at and say, 'Nailed that one.' But endless dissatisfaction is, I suppose, what gets us out of bed in the morning.","I admit I can't shake the idea that there is virtue in suffering, that there is a sort of psychic economy, whereby if you embrace success, happiness and comfort, these things have to be paid for.","Girls are complicated. The instruction manual that comes with girls is 800 pages, with chapters 14, 19, 26 and 32 missing, and it's badly translated, hard to figure out.","I think of House as a deeply moral character, though some would no doubt argue with me. He does not judge. Beyond his normal tetchiness, there were no more than a half-dozen moments of actual condemnation from him. He understood lies and also why you lied, and there was an absolution there that is very, very appealing.","People will survive, and they will find happiness. Happiness only comes when you're not looking for it.","I feel like a hostage to fortune. Not that I am complaining. I wanted to play the role. But in truth I didn't think the show would be such a success. OK, I thought it would fail. Not because it was bad. I was confident it was good, but plenty of good things just sort of wither on the vine.","I have my moments. Ever since I was a boy, I never was someone who was at ease with happiness. Too often I embrace introspection and self-doubt. I wish I could embrace the good things.","Screenwriting is the most prized of all the cinematic arts. Actually, it isn't, but it should be.","I never went to drama school, I don't have any certificates saying: 'He's a qualified actor.' But I did think that 'House' was something I didn't have to apologise for. It was something I was really proud of and it was sort of... whether you liked it or not, it was undeniable.","I think maybe even one of the reasons I became an actor was actually to hide. I mean, it sounds paradoxical because, of course, people are standing up in a public place and encouraging other people to look at them. So that's not the conventional definition of hiding.","Acting is largely about putting on masks, and music is about removing them.","I think my father gave me a great reverence for medical science. He was about as opposite to the personality of House as one could imagine. He was polite and easygoing, and would have gone to great lengths to make his patients feel attended to and heard and sympathized with.","I have always stuck up for Western medicine. You can chew all the celery you want, but without antibiotics, three quarters of us would not be here.","I never was someone who was at ease with happiness.","Celebrity is absolutely preposterous. Entertainment seems to be inflating. It used to be the punctuation to your life, a film or a novel or a play, a way of celebrating a good week or month. Now it feels as if it's all punctuation.","To be able to pretend to be something that I'm frankly not is very liberating and exciting.","I feel like I'm working on an oil rig right now. I'm away from home a lot.","I couldn't imagine what Fox thought they were doing, contemplating such a jagged protagonist for a prime-time drama. I only knew that I wanted the role very much.","I didn't realize House would be the central character, more the bitter comic relief appearing occasionally. I relish his wounded nature - the lameness, the scarred Byronic hero.","I don't talk like House, or walk like him. I certainly don't think like him. I don't like to think for more than 15 minutes at a stretch actually; I am a fragile flower.","My dad gave me my first bike at 16. I soon fell off and was in a wheelchair for weeks. I haven't fallen since.","One of the principal goals in my life has been to avoid embarrassing my children by doing the job I do. I hope I've managed to do that, and I hope that, with the job I'm in now, they are, if not proud, at least unembarrassed by it. I must say, my three are most agreeable children, who do nothing but delight me.","Seems to me that this business, for actors anyway, is not so much about whether or not you do good work. It's about whether or not you get the chance to do good work.","I hate menus, I hate choosing food. I just want to be brought. Bring me dinner!","I personally believe that the iPod is a frankly corrosive device because it encourages you to surround yourself with your favorites. The whole idea of a playlist is to surround yourself with your favorite things, and the interesting thing is that when you do that, they cease to be your favorites.","Some people are drawn naturally - there are natural guitarists, and there are natural piano players, and I think guitar implies travel, a sort of footloose gypsy existence. You grab your bag and you go to the next town.","To be a head boy, you have to be very clever, you have to be a scholar, and I was never a scholar in any shape or form.","I have resolved to pick one novel and just read it over and over again for the rest of my life, because I cannot remember anything anymore.","I just read an 800-page history of the Scottish Enlightenment and, honestly, I may as well just start it again now, because I cannot remember a single thing. I can barely remember where Scotland is.","Believe it or not, perhaps I don't show it much, or well, but I think I like people.","You hope that your teenage self would like and forgive your 50-year-old self.","I do actually like Los Angeles. Partly because I was told I wouldn't.","When the ship goes down, the waves very quickly roll over the top of it, and attention shifts elsewhere. It's just the natural order of things in TV - in life - and is as it should be.","I don't really understand why everybody doesn't want to direct. It's an absolutely fascinating combination of skills required and puzzles set on every possible level, emotional and practical and technical. It calls upon such a wide variety of skills. I find it completely absorbing.","Pain is an event. It happens to you, and you deal with it in whatever way you can.","The great trap for non-American actors trying to play Americans, I think, is to start thinking of American-ness as a characteristic. It isn't. It is no more a character trait than height. It is just a physical fact, and that's all there is to it.","I really do believe the camera steals the soul. But that may be because I'm worried about my soul. I don't have much of a soul to begin with; I can't afford to lose much.","Clive Dunn, as I understand it, retired to the south of Spain, where he worked extensively in watercolours. I don't own any of Clive Dunn's watercolours. I loved him in 'Dad's Army,' loved him. But not enough to actually seek out his watercolour work.","I don't like the act of talking; it makes me slightly light-headed.","Unhappiness is an unfinished state; happy people don't need our help.","Piano was - well, all musical instruments were taught in this very rigid, formal, classical method when I was young.","I was too shy, I think, to sing publicly. It takes a particular kind of person. And when I was young, I was not that person. In the first instance, when a record company said to me, do you want to try and make your record, my first reaction was, no, I'm not worthy - I couldn't possibly, and so on and so forth.","I don't think of myself as funny. I think of myself as rather grave, actually. And I'm suspicious of fun. I never quite know what that is or how to deal with it or how to generate it. That's my fault. I know it's a burden on the people I'm with. It's tiresome.","I've never been clever with money. I will buy anything at the top of the market.","The glory of American television is Dennis Franz.","I wouldn't be able to act like Al Pacino or play the piano like Dr. John, But I could probably act better than Dr. John and play the piano better than Al Pacino.","When I was a small boy, 10, 11, 12, probably somewhere around there, when I first heard a blues song on the radio, it was a jolt of electricity. It grabbed me by the throat, it made me shiver. And I knew from that moment that this was for me and this would be with me for the rest of my life.","I feel when acting, I am sometimes overly self-conscious; I think, 'Going, no, don't, put your eyebrow back where it was and, you know, turn to the left.' You know, I'm sort of very consciously adopting this character. But with music, I don't know. I found it was a question of just closing my eyes and just sort of letting things come out.","It doesn't rain at all in California. Once a month, a man drives through spraying Evian.","They're very harsh people, the British: hard to impress, very tough on each other, but I rather like that. It's not that the British are more honest - you're just under no illusion with them.","Directing is the best job going. I don't understand why everybody doesn't want to direct. It's an absolutely fascinating combination of skills required and puzzles set on every level - emotional and practical and technical. It calls up on such a wide variety of skills. I find it completely absorbing. I just love the whole process.","In film, because you know where the ending is, characters can change, but in television, you substitute revelation for change, and that can be hard to pull off.","I think there is a basic comfort in clever people who know things.","The financing of all TV shows is dictated by finding an audience between 18 and 49. I have now passed beyond 49, so probably, I am no longer a desirable commodity for TV. And I am at peace with that; that's fine.","Lots of people would say House doesn't have any charm at all. I would disagree, though: I find him immensely charming and endlessly entertaining. He has a sort of grace and a wit about him, and ultimately, I think he is on the side of the angels.","Music is one of the noblest callings I can think of. It's the highest of all the art forms to me. For example, if my kid said to me, 'I want to give it all up,' whatever it is that they're doing, 'and I want to take my saxophone and go out,' I would say, 'May God go with you. This is a great and noble thing that you're doing.'","Even the greatest poets, I think, cannot quite get to the places that music can get to in the human - I was gonna say mind, but it's actually the entire body. It somehow seems to infuse the entire body.","The first big stars, Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, you know, these were gigantic stars. I even wonder sometimes whether all music actually comes from women, whether the first glimmering of music is a mother soothing a baby.","The strange thing - and this is one of the advantages of being incredibly shallow and superficial - is that wherever I am, that's sort of home.","I never thought I'd end up living in Los Angeles while my children grew up in Britain, but here I am, and we are all making the best of it.","It alarms me to think of all that I have read and how little of it has stayed with me."],"Hugh Leonard":["A thing well done is worth doing.","Arnold Bennett was a writer I admired. He was actually taking notes at his father's deathbed.","As somebody once said, we're not punished for our sins, we're punished by them.","Gossip is more popular than literature.","I came down to the living room one day and my wife was standing in the living room. It wasn't an illusion. I saw her out of the corner of my eye. The moment I saw her, she vanished.","I don't think anyone is the perfect one to play me.","I feel like the writer observing the grief, but it is difficult to be detached from it.","I think with every writer there are two people there.","I went through life like an idiot for a great deal of the time, saying there's nothing I would change. That was a very arrogant thing to say. There's a lot I would change. There are people I would have steered clear of.","I'm a much nicer person since my wife died. I found out what pain is, so on that level I'm much nicer.","I'm a writer, and what I do is write. I wasn't able to do anything else.","I've always believed in survival.","I've always enjoyed a woman's company more than men's. They're usually better looking.","It's a natural thing for people to say, you know, Who's in this book? I find myself get ting a little defensive. People come along and I'm waiting for that first question.","My father I liked, but it was only after his death that I got to know him by writing the play.","My life is every moment of my life. It is not a culmination of the past.","My mother was passionate. She was stubborn, the dominant one in the family. She dominated my father.","The problem with Ireland is that it's a country full of genius, but with absolutely no talent.","We are all the foolishness and all the crimes we did. We're also all the kindnesses we did. I hate to think of life as if we understood time. We don't understand time.","We were married for almost 45 years. We fought all the time, it wasn't a great love or anything, it wasn't a great, all-consuming passion. She was just there. A lot of people were startled because we didn't seem devoted but we were."],"Hugh Lofting":["I make no claim to be an authority on writing or illustrating for children.","The fact that I have been successful merely means that I can write and illustrate in my own way.","There has always been a tendency to classify children almost as a distinct species."],"Hugh MacDiarmid":["It is time we in Scotland put England in its proper place and instead of our leaning on England and taking inspiration from her, we should lean and turn to Europe, for it is there our future prosperity lies.","Our principal writers have nearly all been fortunate in escaping regular education.","There are plenty of ruined buildings in the world but no ruined stones."],"Hugh Mackay":["Nothing is perfect. Life is messy. Relationships are complex. Outcomes are uncertain. People are irrational.","A strangely reflective, even melancholy day. Is that because, unlike our cousins in the northern hemisphere, Easter is not associated with the energy and vitality of spring but with the more subdued spirit of autumn?","Obviously, every child should be given the best possible opportunity to acquire literacy skills.","But the rule seems to be that the bigger and more life-changing the decision, the less it will seem like a decision at all.","Still, most of those effects occur in the context of harmless play and it is patently obvious that children are not normally turned into aggressive little monsters by TV or video games, since most children do not become aggressive little monsters.","So, if falling crime rates coincide with the rise of violent video games and increasing violence on TV and at the cinema, should we conclude that media violence is causing the drop in crime rates?","Is it possible that literacy standards are falling because young Australians are growing up in a culture in which they can be entertained and informed, and in which they can communicate effectively, without having to master any but the most rudimentary literacy skills?","I suspect the secret of personal attraction is locked up in our unique imperfections, flaws and frailties.","Parents should be encouraged to read to their children, and teachers should be equipped with all available techniques for teaching literacy, so the varying needs and capacities of individual kids can be taken into account.","It seems inevitable that the magic of the written word will fade.","Perhaps it's the people whose lives have taken sudden new twists - people who have learned to embrace the creative possibilities of change - who stand the best chance of penetrating life's mysteries.","Some researchers sensibly suggest that rather than worrying too much about which programs our children are watching, we should concentrate on trying to reduce the total amount of time they spend in front of the screen.","Actually, I can't imagine anything more tedious than a perfect person, especially if it was someone who also demanded perfection from me.","Indeed, in the present climate of mistrust of institutions, many people who yearn for a more meaningful and fulfilling life would regard the church as an unlikely place to go for guidance.","Recounting their histories, people often sound like interested bystanders to their own lives.","The underlying message of the Lancet article is that if you want to understand aggressive behaviour in children, look to the social and emotional environment in which they are growing up, and the values they bring to the viewing experience.","I'm in total sympathy with Dick Smith's sentiments; I only wish there were grounds for saying we Australians would never tolerate such appalling treatment of refugees being carried out in our name.","I wish we didn't have to own up to a policy deliberately designed to inflict suffering on people who have already been traumatised in the countries from which they've fled.","It's Australian to do such things because, however uncivilised they may seem, it's human to do them.","One reason we resist making deliberate choices is that choice equals change and most of us, feeling the world is unpredictable enough, try to minimise the trauma of change in our personal lives.","Although we love the idea of choice - our culture almost worships it - we seek refuge in the familiar and the comfortable.","No one welcomes chaos, but why crave stability and predictability?","The copycat effects of media violence, similar to those previously attributed to westerns, radio serials and comic books, are easy to exaggerate.","On average, Australians watch more than three hours of television a day, compared with 12 minutes a day spent by the average couple talking to each other.","Reading is a huge effort for many people, a bore for others, and, believe it or not, many people prefer watching TV.","Universal literacy was a 20th-century goal. Before then, reading and writing were skills largely confined to a small, highly educated class of professional people.","The question is, will we continue to fight what may be a rearguard action to defend universal literacy as a central goal of our education system, or are we bold enough to see what's actually happening to our culture?"],"Hugh Masekela":["I am a forward-looking person and live in the moment to build for the future.","I lived for music since I could think.","Once in a while, I treat myself to a cheesecake or carrot cake.","I don't criticise anybody, but I just don't understand religion. Like I don't understand nationalism. These are the two things that cause wars. I don't understand why they are supposed to be good things.","If I don't make heritage visible and the strength of mother tongue important for my grandchildren, it scares me that they might say in 20 years from now, 'Well, it is rumoured that we used to be Africans long ago.' And in many urban areas, it's already happening.","I'm very interested in heritage restoration, and I'm working with a group of people to create a number of academies and performance spaces to encourage native arts and crafts and to explore African history.","I don't think any musician ever thinks about making a statement. I think everybody goes into music loving it.","I think it is incumbent on all human beings to oppose injustice in every form.","I want to see Nelson walking down the streets of South Africa; I want to see him walking hand-in-hand with Winnie Mandela.","I live a very enjoyable life. I understand what moderation is.","In some townships, political parties are run by thugs financed from Cape Town. If we don't have support of the police, we can not have the ability to organize and to gain even a slight semblance of power.","One of the greatest things that could really happen to Africa is for us to get rid of the borders and for the leadership not to think that the countries belong to them... We didn't create the borders to start with.","I'm not a Christian. My participation in music is so full blast, 24 hours a day. And that's my religion. I think I'm as spiritual as the pope, because I spend as much time in my spirituality as he does.","I've got to where am in life not because of something I brought to the world but through something I found - the wealth of African culture.","What people don't know about oppression is that the oppressor works much harder. You always grew up being told you were not smart enough or not fast enough, but we all lived from the time we were children to beat the system.","It's obvious that the rest of the world loves high African culture - African culture, period.","The apartheid people were actors, and they had to act out their part in their beliefs every day. That's why we always saw them as being comedic.","Mandela was chosen as a symbol of the South African struggle, and he did that great. But I wasn't just happy for him. I was happy for the people.","I always make the joke that I go home, to one of my homes, to go and do laundry so I can go on the road again.","I'm travelling more than ever. I don't have the answer as to why, but the demand seems to have grown as I've got older.","To tell you the truth, man, we spend most of the time travelling in hotels, in festivals, in concert halls, clubs, airports. The most unenjoyable part is all the security at airports.","I've always stood on one fact - that all over the world, there are only two things, the Establishment and the poor people. The poor people are a massive majority and across the world they are exploited in different kinds of ways. The Establishment depends on exploiting raw materials and the poor.","I just came from South Africa, a place that had been in a perpetual uprising since 1653, so the uprising had become a way of life in our culture and we grew up with rallies and strikes and marches and boycotts.","I don't think anybody has ever been able to live up to what they promised. I don't know a government that has ever been successful at that because once they get into power, things change and the world is controlled also by business now.","Africa has been troubled for a long time - well, the world has been troubled ever since I was born.","When people campaign for positions, they promise people all kinds of things.","I don't think what I do is influenced by suffering. I come from a talented people who are prolific in music and dance.","When I left South Africa in 1960 I was 20 years old. I wanted to try to get an education, and music education was not available for me in South Africa.","When I left South Africa there were 10 million people - when I came back there were more than 40 million. I had to learn how to get to the highways because when I left where there were no highways.","I grew up with protests, marches, demonstrations, struggle. But I come from a clan of community workers.","In my view, Africa's real problems are cultural.","Twenty years ago, I was part of a movement of millions of people who were going after freedom. But today, they look and they say, 'What are the advantages of freedom?' So far, it's the vote and maybe, in certain places, lack of police harassment. You can live anywhere you want and do anything you want - if you have the means.","The thing that is being lost is heritage. In Africa, religion and advertisement and television and media hype have gotten Africans to where they are convinced psychologically that their own heritage is heathen, pagan, barbaric, savage, primitive.","I don't think I have the power to forgive.","I think the most difficult thing that has had to happen in South Africa for the previously disadvantaged communities is they had to reconcile that the oppressor has been enriched and the establishment is now making five or 10 times more profit than they were during the time the economic embargo was on them.","Corruption is everywhere, man.","Just because Nelson has been released doesn't mean the government has done us any favors. We have nothing to be grateful for. The government destroyed our country, destroyed our people. If anybody needs amnesty, it is the government.","I have a major respect for nature. I'm an environmentalist.","I started playing the piano when I was 6 years old 'cause my folks tried to get me away from the gramophone. And I just - I lived for music since I could think. And they got me piano lessons. So by the time I was 13, I was quite an accomplished piano player and musician.","I got possessed by music as an infant.","Whatever you go into, you have to go in there to be the best. There's no formulas. It's all about passion and honesty and hard work. It might look glamorous, but it takes a lot of hard work. The blessing with the arts is that you can do it forever.","Watching a Kirk Douglas movie, 'Young Man With A Horn,' made me want to be a trumpet player.","I couldn't get away from the gramophone. It was the only thing that I ever really liked, and I was singing along by the time I was five years old - to the Modernaires and Billie Holiday and Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole.","For me to want to play the trumpet was a very, very odd thing for my clan as a whole. One of my uncles was a high school principal, and he referred to my trumpet as a bugle, which really hurt me.","Apartheid didn't impinge on music. It impinged on people's freedoms.","Not only in Africa but in much of the world, most leaders' pockets are lined by industrial business. And industrial business is never going to stop aiming at profit."],"Hugh Miller":["Problems are only opportunities with thorns on them.","But the advice was not taken - Johnstone did emigrate to Canada, and did mortgage his pension; and I fear - though I failed to trace his after history - that he suffered in consequence.","Their humble dwellings were of their own rearing; it was they themselves who had broken in their little fields; from time immemorial, far beyond the reach of history, had they possessed their mountain holdings.","Life itself is a school, and Nature always a fresh study.","Save for thee and thy lessons, man in society would everywhere sink into a sad compound of the fiend and the wild beast; and this fallen world would be as certainly a moral as a natural wilderness.","They were, I doubt not, happy enough in their dark stalls, because they were horses, and had plenty to eat; and I was at times quite happy enough in the dark loft, because I was a man, and could think and imagine.","Donald had reached its further edge, and could hear the rush of the stream from the deep obscurity of the abyss below, when there rose from the opposite side a strain of the most delightful music he had ever heard."],"Hugh Newell Jacobsen":["When you look at a city, it's like reading the hopes, aspirations and pride of everyone who built it.","It is our art that has an opportunity to leave a footprint in the sand. They don't wrap fish in our work.","The permanent power brokers of this city are the columnists.","Washington is the only city in the world where you can go to a black-tie dinner and there at the foot of the table is a television set up to catch a press conference."],"Hugh Prather":["Just when I think I have learned the way to live, life changes.","Negative feedback is better that none. I would rather have a man hate me than overlook me. As long as he hates me I make a difference.","To live for results would be to sentence myself to continuous frustration. My only sure reward is in my actions and not from them.","Almost any difficulty will move in the face of honesty. When I am honest I never feel stupid. And when I am honest I am automatically humble.","Whenever we condemn, we cloak the world in pain.","If the desire to write is not accompanied by actual writing, then the desire must be not to write."],"Hugh Ross":["God put the human race in charge of managing the resources of the entire planet for the benefit of all life. Therefore, we, of all people on this planet, should be concerned about environmental issues and doing what we can to enhance the beauty and productivity of the natural realm.","The potential in many environmental issues is that if you undertake corrective action without appropriate understanding of the problem, then you wind up doing more harm than good.","An adult human can last 40 days without food, a week without any sleep, three days without water, but only five minutes without air. Yet nothing is more taken for granted than the air we breathe. However, not just any air will do - it must be exquisitely designed to meet our needs. Too little oxygen in the atmosphere will kill us, as will too much.","Sticks and stones may break bones, but words do more damage than most people can imagine. Especially name-calling. 'You're dangerous!' 'Deceived.' 'A false prophet.' 'A compromiser!' Charges like these by young-earth leaders, both spoken and implied, are intended to discredit, maim, and crush old-earth advocates, including me.","What's true will never contradict what's true. Article 2 of the Belgic Confession, based on Psalm 19, Romans 1, and several other texts, declares that God has given us two reliable revelations: the words of Scripture and the facts of nature. Thus, it would be impossible for the facts of nature ever to contradict the words of the Bible.","Logically, taking Scripture seriously means being passionately concerned about interpreting it correctly and thus welcoming any evidence that exposes erroneous understandings of the biblical text. Unfortunately, many zealous Bible students and teachers confuse their favorite interpretations of the Bible with the Bible itself.","To insist that belief in the Bible demands belief in a young Earth is to put a stumbling block in the path of many nonbelievers. It raises the question of why a God who is committed to revealing truth would make the universe and Earth measure to be old if, in fact, they are not.","The earth's history over the past several million years is that for every 100,000 years, we go through a dramatic climatic cycle where we get 90,000 years of ice age and 10,000 years of a warm period. I think people today just have the expectation that we deserve a perfectly benign climate forever.","The scientific content of Genesis 1-11 holds special significance for me because it revolutionized my thinking and, thus, changed my life's direction. Until I reached my late teens, my singular passion was science, astronomy in particular. My life's purpose was to learn more about the universe; nothing beyond that really interested me.","The Bible gives a true and trustworthy account of creation, and that account in no way conflicts with or contradicts an old-Earth view, and vice versa.","The age of the Earth makes no difference with respect to Christ's atoning sacrifice for humanity's sin or to the nature and character of God, Earth's age has no bearing on any of the historic Christian doctrines. No mention of Earth's age appears in even the most detailed creedal statements.","The fact is the planet is warming right now, and it is easier to blame it on some human activity rather than saying we should better understand the whole problem and recognize there are natural conditions that are impacting this, too.","How can we love the Lord our God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength if we must separate our minds from our faith? Such a separation violates the very meaning of faith.","I came to trust in Jesus as my Savior after a two-year personal study of the Bible that convinced me that Scripture is free of contradiction and error - doctrinally, historically, and scientifically.","Many Christians are raised believing that to be true to God's Word means to accept that the universe, Earth, and life were created in six 24-hour days, only a few thousand years ago. Most people lack the theological and scientific tools to think through the implications of this teaching.","Fundamentalist Christians, adhering to what is termed 'creation science,' loudly promote the scientific accuracy of the Bible, but they sift or reinterpret science through the tiny mesh of their ideological filter. Not much real science gets through.","Most Americans and other Westerners claim to have read all or part of the Bible. However, when asked to identify even four books of the Bible or four of Jesus' disciples or four of the Ten Commandments, fewer than half even attempt to respond and fewer than one in ten respond correctly."],"Hugh Shelton":["Whether or not you could actually increase the size of the force is something that will have to be determined.","Well, it has been rather hectic since the 11th of September. And even before then it was quite busy.","Well, I enjoy sharing in the dangers that we ask our men and women in uniform to share in almost every day.","We came back right over the World Trade Center and could see, even from that altitude, the devastation, the smoke that was coming up. It was obvious it was going to be horrible.","Wayne Downing is also a great leader, has served our nation very well, and I think it's great that he's coming back to join a very capable administration already of dealing with this problem, and it will just strengthen that team.","Those are the things that, in the wrong hands - and certainly in our war on terrorism we also must attack proliferation and those nations that proliferate with chemical, biological and nuclear type devices, because that can cause the most catastrophic results.","They were involved in a firefight and felt they were surrounded. Whether they escaped from that and were fleeing and went in the wrong direction, we don't know.","There are a lot of things that have to be considered in National. The military aspect of it is only one of them. I'm confident that President Bush will have all of those things laid out for him before he makes the decision.","The standards to get in are very high. We don't want to lower those standards.","The first truth for special operations is that quality is more important than quantity.","Our people are working overtime - I say our people; our federal agencies in this regard - and that I'm confident that the way that you can stop this and make Americans the most protected for this is to take it to the terrorist groups.","Of course, you always have to be concerned about hijacking. But with the measures that are in place right now, I'd say that probably the airways are as safe as they've been in a good number of years.","My goal was to make first lieutenant. I never spent a lot of time worrying about what came after that.","It is changing the face of terrorism. It is basically bringing it to the United States, to our great citizens. We know the terrorists are barbaric and murderers that attack innocent civilians, as they did in this case.","I'm not going to say whether I'm a Republican or a Democrat.","I was, somewhere in the neighborhood of about 300 jumps.","I think that the American people should rest assured and be assured that every federal agency that has a role to play in this terrorism is working overtime now, taking every necessary action to protect our great citizens.","I jump out of perfectly good airplanes, and it's a great thrill and it allows me to share in the dangers that our great men and women in uniform share in on a regular basis.","I had seen the films out of World War II, the great 82nd Airborne, the 101st, and all of those of you in the greatest generation and the service that you had provided.","I feel very confident that Americans flying in the air are safe and that only under the most dire of circumstances would our pilots ever even request permission to do that.","I believe that this is a different war than America has ever fought in the past. It is a non-conventional war. It means that you've got to use every tool you've got available to you.","I always concentrated on doing the very best that I could in the job and the duties that I was assigned.","But the other thing is that I feel very confident in the individual pilots. They are tremendous individuals. They are individuals that have sworn to protect and defend our very citizens. That's why we serve.","But it's been a great, humbling - and I've been very honored to have the opportunity to serve and to lead and to be the representative of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines who are in Washington. And it's been the greatest honor of my life.","But again, we, I think, over the years have set the example for a lot of nations that may not have had the same values, the same type of coming out of the same culture that we as Americans have and enjoy. But we can be an example, a role model for them.","And so I'm still giving some thought - I will transition hopefully into the corporate world. And I look forward to getting involved in several other areas that I have a great interest in.","And occasionally some of the nations that will be partners in this would probably not be, in terms of passing a pure human rights check, have everything going for them that you would like to have."],"Hugh Sidey":["A sense of humor... is needed armor. Joy in one's heart and some laughter on one's lips is a sign that the person down deep has a pretty good grasp of life.","The legions of reporters who cover politics don't want to quit the clash and thunder of electoral combat for the dry duty of analyzing the federal budget. As a consequence, we have created the perpetual presidential campaign.","They can see the brave silhouette from almost anywhere in the District of Columbia and use it as a compass to locate other monuments and eventually to find their way out of the great, gray federal wilderness.","A White House dinner is the American family assembled, from labor leaders to billionaires, actors, architects, academicians and athletes.","The problems seem so easy out there on the stump. Deficits shrink with a rhetorical flourish.","The prime minister found something hopeful in the man's eyes and manner. The 30 or so people who run this world analyze one another that way and then make decisions of life and death for us. Scary, but true.","Kennedy did not have to run the risk of having his ideas and his words shortened and adulterated by a correspondent.

Is sign language the real language of Paradise?","We should burn all libraries and allow to remain only that which everyone knows by heart. A beautiful age of the legend would then begin."],"Hugo Black":["The Framers of the Constitution knew that free speech is the friend of change and revolution. But they also knew that it is always the deadliest enemy of tyranny.","The Founding Fathers gave the free press the protection it must have to bare the secrets of government and inform the people.","Laws are made to protect the trusting as well as the suspicious.","Our Constitution was not written in the sands to be washed away by each wave of new judges blown in by each successive political wind.","Paramount among the responsibilities of a free press is the duty to prevent any part of the government from deceiving the people and sending them off to distant lands to die of foreign fevers and foreign shot and shell.","The layman's constitutional view is that what he likes is constitutional and that which he doesn't like is unconstitutional.","It is the paradox of life that the way to miss pleasure is to seek it first. The very first condition of lasting happiness is that a life should be full of purpose, aiming at something outside self.","A union of government and religion tends to destroy government and degrade religion.","In revealing the workings of government that led to the Vietnam War, the newspapers nobly did precisely that which the Founders hoped and trusted they would do.","When I was 40, my doctor advised me that a man in his 40s shouldn't play tennis. I heeded his advice carefully and could hardly wait until I reached 50 to start again.","Criticism of government finds sanctuary in several portions of the 1st Amendment. It is part of the right of free speech. It embraces freedom of the press.","In my view, far from deserving condemnation for their courageous reporting, the New York Times, the Washington Post and other newspapers should be commended for serving the purpose that the Founding Fathers saw so clearly."],"Hugo Chavez":["I'm a man with many defects. I love. I sing. I dream. I was born in the poor countryside. I was raised in the countryside, planting corn and selling sweets made by my grandmother. My children, my two daughters are with me and I want a better world for my grandchildren, for your grandchildren.","The only way to save the world is through socialism, but a socialism that exists within a democracy; there's no dictatorship here.","Mutual respect! That's what it takes to be friends.","The government of the United States doesn't want peace. It wants to exploit its system of exploitation, of pillage, of hegemony through war. It wants peace, but what's happening in Iraq? What happened in Lebanon? Palestine? What's happening? What's happened over the last hundred years in Latin America and in the world?","There is no turning back.","When we were children, we were told that we have a motherland, and that motherland was Spain. However, we have discovered later, in our lives, that as a matter of fact, we have several motherlands. And one of the greatest motherlands of all is, no doubt, Africa.","Racism is very characteristic of imperialism. Racism is very characteristic of capitalism.","I am convinced that the path to a new, better and possible world is not capitalism, the path is socialism.","Venezuela is a free country, and we will not be blackmailed by anyone. We will not accept being told what to do over Iran; we will not accept being anyone's colony.","I've been in revolt for years against ignominy, against injustice, against inequality, against immorality, against the exploitation of human beings.","Convinced as I am and as I am from my government that the world needs a new moral architecture over all I believe that this should be the first topic to debate in our world of today, ethics, moral.","I don't care about the internal political system of the United States. I want to be a friend of United States, of its baseball, its institutions, its rock and roll, its workers, and its technology because we need it. I want to be friends of the Arab people, of the Persian people, of the Asian people.","Venezuela has the largest oil reserve, and Venezuela has to defend itself.","We must reduce all the emissions that are destroying the planet. However, that requires a change in lifestyle, a change in the economic model: We must go from capitalism to socialism.","What a thing, Europe. Europe! The cultured Europe! We are the barbarians, the Indians, the blacks, the southerners. How cynical is Europe. Chavez the tyrant! Chavez the strongman! Chavez, who wants to stay forever. While there, they have kings, my friend!","One of the greatest rebels, who I really admire: Christ. He was a rebel. He ended up being crucified. He was a great rebel. He rebelled against the established power that subjugated.","There's been an open attack by the U.S. government, an immoral attack, to try and prevent Venezuela from being freely elected to a post in the Security Council. The imperium is afraid of truth, is afraid of independent voices. It calls us extremists, but they are the extremists.","I was a farm kid from the plains of South Venezuela, from a very poor family. I grew up in a palm tree house with an earthen floor.","Venezuelan interests are to be defended by Venezuela. The U.S. should defend the interests of the U.S. Where are the U.S. people, where are the intellectuals, who could put limits on their government?","Long live the Unity of Latin America.","I even believed in a third way; I thought it was possible to put a human face on capitalism. But I was wrong. The only way to save the world is through socialism, but a socialism that exists within a democracy; there's no dictatorship here.","Capitalism is destroying the world.","Simon Bolivar turned over all of his land. He freed all of his slaves, and he turned them into soldiers, and he brought them here. He brought them to Peru and Carabobo, and he worked together with the troops of San Martin to liberate this continent. That is Simon Bolivar.","Don't be shameless, Mr Blair. Don't be immoral, Mr Blair. You are one of those who have no morals. You are not one who has the right to criticise anyone about the rules of the international community.","I remember. How many minutes do I have left President? About one, one minute.","It makes one sad to see the sell-out of President Fox; really, it makes one sad. How sad that the president of a people like the Mexicans lets himself become the puppy dog of the empire.","The immoral veto of the United States allowed the Israelis, with impunity, to destroy Lebanon. Right in front of all of us as we stood there watching, a resolution in the council was prevented.","In my opinion, Obama can become one of the biggest frustrations in the history for many people, not for me, but for the people of the United States that voted for him and saw him as a symbol of hope for change.","Our voice is an independent voice to represent the dignity and the search for peace and the reformulation of the international system; to denounce persecution and aggression of hegemonistic forces on the planet. This is how Venezuela has presented itself. Bolivar's home has sought a nonpermanent seat on the Security Council.","I wish Obama would focus on governing the United States and would forget his country's imperialist pretensions.","I became a soldier, not because I had a military vocation initially, but because it was the only way that that young, poor-class child from the provinces could go to the center of the country: through baseball, which was my dream.","The U.N. system, born after the Second World War, collapsed. It's worthless.","The U.S. only has 20 billion barrels of oil in reserve. It seems as though there is no more oil around. Venezuela has 300 billion barrels of oil in reserves. Iraq has, like, 150 billion barrels of oil. Iran, close to 300 billion barrels of reserve. Oil for 200 years, of course.","I was born in the poor countryside. I was raised in the countryside, planting corn and selling sweets made by my grandmother.","The 'Alliance for Progress' was a political proposal to improve conditions. It was aimed at lowering the social difference between cultures.","Kennedy was the driving force of reform in America.","I'm going to show the world that I'm not a tyrant, much less a devil.","Simon Bolivar is the leader of the revolution of this land. He is the leader of the social revolution, the people's revolution, the historical revolution.","Our policy is to deepen the relations with all the countries in the world - monarchies, kingdoms, large powers - we want to respect all differences and have our relationships based on mutual respect.","I hereby accuse the North American empire of being the biggest menace to our planet.","Oil is a very valuable resource for life - electric heaters. We must have to transition ourselves to a post-oil era. And that's what we must discuss: searching and developing new sources of energy. And that requires scientific research. That requires investment. And the developed countries must be the ones to assume this responsibility first.","In the United States, the government is bailing out banks, intervening in the economy, yet in Latin America, the Right continues to talk about 'free markets.' It's totally outdated; they don't have arguments; they don't have any sense.","The imperialists see extremists everywhere. It's not that we are extremists. It's that the world is waking up. It's waking up all over, and people are standing up.","I have said it already, I am convinced that the way to build a new and better world is not capitalism. Capitalism leads us straight to hell.","They do not walk in... the path of Christ.","This has been a great victory for the Venezuelan people.","Venezuela has changed forever.","We must confront the privileged elite who have destroyed a large part of the world.","An infernal machine that produces every minute an impressive amount of poor, 26 million poor in 10 years are 2.6 million per year of new poor, this is the road, well, the road to hell.","I am a President held prisoner, that I haven't resigned and I will not resign.","No part of the human community can live entirely on its own planet, with its own laws of motion and cut off from the rest of humanity.","We're not perfect, but we do have democracy.","The left is back, and it's the only path we have to get out of the spot to which the right has sunken us. Socialism builds and capitalism destroys.","I shook Obama's hand and I said, 'I want to be your friend.' My hand is still outstretched. I am not Obama's enemy, but it's difficult not see imperialism in Washington. Those who don't see it don't want to see it, like the ostrich.","I painted. I wanted to be a painter. I sang.","What is the U.S. government looking for? And the elite governing this country? They're looking for oil.","I think developed countries - so-called developed countries - should reflect upon the way of living and the waste of energy.","The U.S. people have a major role to play to solve, to save this planet.","Most governments in the United States in a hundred years have not respected the peoples of Latin America. They have sponsored coup d'etats, assassinations.","We want to be brothers and sisters. We want respect and equality. Simon Bolivar, our father, said a balanced world - a universe - a balanced universe in order to have peace and development.","The world needs a true leader, an Obama that promotes peace and understanding in the world.","I think the United States and the secretary of State should be concerned about the poverty in this country - people without health insurance. The United States should stop being the empire and be concerned about other countries. You've got to be more worried about your own people.","Even socialist dictators have an interest in gorgeous supermodels.","I'm a Christian. I want the world of justice and equality. This is the only way to achieve peace.","I love Jesus Christ. I am a Christian... I cry when I see injustice, children dying of hunger.","I was an altar boy. My mother wanted me to be a priest. I am very Christian and Catholic. ... I'm very faithful. I believe in God, in Jesus Christ.","The problem is not the oil, but what they do with the oil. The United States is the biggest spender of oil and of all the planet resources.","We must reduce the emissions 100 percent. In Venezuela, the emissions are currently insignificant compared to the emissions of the developed countries.","Noam Chomsky has a book, which I read for the first time when I was in Spain, called 'Fear of Democracy'. There is your answer. Fear of democracy. In Honduras, they had a sham democracy. It was run by elites, what was called a liberal democracy, but in reality was a false democracy.","I wish we could begin a new period of normal relations with the government of the United States.","It's a lie! I am not an anti-Semite. The World Jewish Congress supported me and said that I am not anti-Semitic.","My father and my mother were both teachers. They inculcated to us the importance of studies.","Dr. Insulza is quite an idiot, a true idiot. The insipid Dr. Insulza should resign from the secretariat of the OAS for daring to play that role.","I'm not loved by Hillary Clinton... and I don't love her either.","Venezuela, with Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, is a full member of Mercosur. And many other Latin American countries, CARICOM, Bolivia have expressed their support for Venezuela. The Arab League, the full Arab League has voiced its support.","As Chomsky says here, clearly and in depth, the American empire is doing all it can to consolidate its system of domination. And we cannot allow them to do that. We cannot allow world dictatorship to be consolidated.","The United States should stop being the 'empire' and be concerned about other countries. You've got to be more worried about your own people.","Venezuela is supporting tens of thousands of poor families in the United States with heating oil.","I've learned to appreciate the thinking of John Kennedy.","Artists are never wrong when they paint revolution with the beautiful dress and with the sword. On the horse or by foot. Because revolution is a woman.","I believe in God, in Jesus Christ. I love Jesus Christ. I am a Christian... I cry when I see injustice, children dying of hunger.","I was an altar boy. My mother wanted me to be a priest. I am very Christian and Catholic... I'm very faithful.","Castro has been a teacher for me. A master. Not on ideology but on strategy.","Fidel is a Marxist-Leninist. I am not. Fidel is an atheist. I am not. One day, we discussed God and Christ. I told Castro, I am a Christian. I believe in the Social Gospels of Christ. He doesn't. Just doesn't. More than once, Castro told me that Venezuela is not Cuba, and we are not in the 1960s.","I neglected my health, and I was reluctant to have medical check-ups. It was a fundamental mistake for a revolutionary, to the Venezuelan people and the international public opinion.","Give me your crown, Jesus. Give me your cross, your thorns, so that I may bleed. But give me life, because I have more to do for this country and these people.","There is film of the Americans landing on the moon. Does that mean the moon shot really happened? In the film, the Yanqui flag is flying straight out. So, is there wind on the moon?","I don't know anything about Osama Bin Laden that doesn't come to me through the filter of the West and its propaganda.","The United States was born with an imperialist impulse. There has been a long confrontation between Monroe and Bolivar... It is necessary that the Monroe Doctrine be broken.","The media has for us a fundamental priority because it is a weapon for the ideological struggle and a weapon to express to the people the hope that we all have.","We must be aware of consumerism! That's our tendency. It's the capitalistic curse that we were poisoned with. We should spend only what is necessary. How do you call the big cars, the latest ones? Hummer! Not a single dollar to import Hummers! What is that? What is that? What kind of revolution is this? One of Hummers? No way!","Raul Reyes was a good revolutionary. I knew him personally.","I will be very sad and worried if the imperialist government was calling me a great democratic man.","The United States is the biggest spender of oil and of all the planet resources. Oil is a very valuable resource for life - electric heaters. We must have to transition ourselves to a post-oil era.","I have to leave the government in the year 2012. I have to go.","The president of the United States of North America, George W. Bush, the little gentleman of the North, the political cadaver that is visiting South America, that little gentleman is the president of all the history of the United States, and in the history of the United States, he has the lowest level of approval in his own country.","Simon Bolivar, when history led him - and as Karl Marx said, men can make history, but only as far as history allows us to do so - when history took Bolivar and made him the leader of the independence process in Venezuela, he made that process revolutionary.","Aristotle might not recognize it, or others who are at the root of democracy. What type of democracy do you impose with marines and bombs?","The capitalist model, the developed model, the consumer model which comes from the North, which it has forced on the world, is falling apart on Earth, and there is no planet nearby that we can emigrate to.","If we reduced the military expenses in 10 percent of the world, we would have enough money to save millions of lives in this world.","Terrorists bombard complete cities, such as Fallujah, Baghdad, innocent women and children.","There is no doubt whatsoever that the U.S. government, lead by Mr. Bush, planned and participated in a coup d'etat in Venezuela in April, 2002."],"Hugo Claus":["In spring they lie flat at the first warmth, they ruin my summer and in autumn they smell of women.","My verses stand gawping a bit.

That wasn't part of the deal when I was born.","For me, my travels have been the chance to go to a place that already exists in my imagination."],"Hugo Weaving":["I think I'm much less self confident today. I actually went through a quite painful period because of that thinking that I was completely hopeless. But I think that's something that we all go through at various times of our lives and it was quite a sustained thing with me.","I kind of like the challenge of jumping into totally different spaces and styles and figuring out how to fit in.","We're all outsiders in a way. We're all alone and can become very lonely.","When you're a kid you have this sense of wonder and wholeness and a strong sense of your own identity.","I used to have two double espressos a day. I gave that up, had headaches for five days but now I'm feeling great.","I think I'm a bit of a dreamer. I don't like the reality of life to impinge much on my life.","It's kind of chased away a few demons for me and, um, it's educated me a little bit more.","Initially I probably didn't even call it acting, but dressing up or something. As a kid I think you fully imagine the world in which you want to inhabit, so you put some clothes on and just kind of freely imagine this world, and it's a total imaginary world.","I guess I judge my films by how pleased I am with the work I do, so it's kind of on another level. If they do well at the box office, then that's great. Then I'm really pleased about that too.","I don't think I'll ever escape the fact that I don't belong anywhere in particular. I've often dreamed about going back to Nigeria, but that's a very romantic notion. It's a hideous country to go to in reality.","I generally find an affinity with a lot of the people I play and I suppose if I didn't feel an affinity for them then they wouldn't be particularly good performances.","I keep thinking I should get a phone, because everyone's got one and it becomes increasingly difficult to exist in a society where everyone else has moved ahead and you haven't.","I didn't get my licence because I wasn't allowed to. But I haven't had a seizure for a long time so I could, theoretically, get my licence. But I'm now just so used to not driving, I'm scared of what I'd do.","I do feel like I'm not entirely an insider.","I'm 'of the world'.","Across the board, Australian films need to have a lot more money spent on selling them.","It's great to blow the image that people have of me out of the water.","People are more likely to pass me on the street without recognizing me, and that's good.","The great thing about stage is that you have a live audience.","As an actor, to do all sorts of different films is great.","Being in the woods at night is a beautiful thing.","Both my parents are English and I was born in West Africa, and I moved around as a kid, lived in Bristol, lived in Buckinghamshire and Surrey as a kid, and then moved when I was 16.","I still, by and large, make low-budget Australian films.","If a film isn't really talking about who we are and what our psychologies are, then we're probably not that interested in it, actually.","I think any role you need to play not so much transforms but I like to think of it as understanding the psychology of another character.","I'm so used to Australian films not getting a release outside Australia.","As an actor, to play someone who's at war with himself, that's so interesting.","As human beings, of course, we're all compromised and complex and contradictory and if a screenplay can express those contradictions within a character and if there's room for me to express them, that's a part I'd love to play, so much more than a character who is heroic and one-dimensional.","I think often in film we limit our imaginations a little - well, quite a lot, actually... things get quite formulaic.","It's a real pleasure to go to work when you're in the most extraordinary surroundings, and working with people who are young and interested and creatively keen.","There's nothing like being on a massive-budget film where you don't know anything, and there's a million people, and no one's communicating.","If the script grabs me and appeals to me, I'm really very keen to work on it.","I think when your image becomes so big that it's hard for a viewer to see a character, then I think you're in danger as an actor of being unable to perform what you should be doing.","I certainly don't advocate terrorism as a way of progressing and understanding people, nor do I believe labeling everything as a terrorist act is helpful either.","Film sets are constantly amusing because you really are creating something that is so very surreal, and I kind of like that.","To me acting originally became an extension of game playing.","I've often dreamed about going back to Nigeria, but that's a very romantic notion.

And you never used the word show. If you used the word show it was an insult.","Everybody's out there wrestling like a robot.","People always expect Hulk Hogan to be standing up straight, or to have the bandanna on, or to not have my arms covered up. If I have an extra large shirt on people go 'oh yeah you look small.' It kind of ruins the mystique.","I've been around so long and no matter if I've done good things or bad things, or my personal life has been good or bad, the fans have always stuck with me.","I'm real critical of myself and if I take the bandana off my head I'm completely bald headed and go from being 58 to looking 68 instantly.","When the script for 'The Wrestler' kept coming to me I said, This movie is so good if you put me in the film as a wrestler people are going to say, 'No credibility, Hulk Hogan isn't a good actor,' whatever Hollywood thinks of me.","I'm loyal to a fault - even though I've been to hell and back with Vince McMahon, I would never to do anything to hurt him. But it's also survival of the fittest out there.","We're probably the opposite of the Osbournes. We run a very tight ship.","I promised each and every Hulkamaniac when I went to that great battlefield in the sky I would bring the WWF title with me.","The only time I'm not Hulk Hogan is when I'm behind closed doors because as soon as I walk out the front door, and somebody says hello to me, I can't just say 'hello' like Terry. When they see me, they see the blond hair, the mustache, and the bald head, they instantly think Hulk Hogan.","You can have a wrestling idea, but you need to have these momentum-shifting moves. We had the Hulkamania movement, then it shifted to the beer-drinking, Stone Cold era, we reinvented the business with growing the black beard and becoming the bad guy, what's that next level.","Nobody told me how to talk or think.","The coolest thing, and I have it at home, is a huge Hulk Hogan, normal-sized pinball machine. When people come over they play it for hours. When you hit the bumpers and the bells ring it goes, 'Oh yeah!' The whole time you're playing this machine it's yelling and screaming at you, 'What you gonna do, brother?!' I think that's the coolest.","I train all the time and the weird thing is I'm in the gym with people between 20 and 25 years old and I look in the mirror and I look better than they do and they are young kids - either they haven't trained hard enough or they aren't serious enough.","The best wrestlers, whether it's a Hulk Hogan or a Rey Mysterio, are the ones who have psychology and can understand this business.","All of a sudden, Hulk Hogan has become retro. Hulk Hogan has become cool again. So to come out and to hear how loud the fans are. To hear how loyal the fans are, it's truly overwhelming. I just can't believe I've been reborn in the WWE.","Wrestling needs to be about the art form again. It needs to be about painting a picture and having a really good match.","The fans know what's happened to me over the past couple of years. I lost my family. I pretty much got devastated financially and the fans know that I've had some hard times - and that's the nature of loyal fans. They want to see the people that they love and believe in get back on their feet.","If I do hit that rope and do a hop, skip and a jump and get up as high as I can, I'm just going to hold my breath, because I know i'm going to hear all kinds of scar tissue popping.","I feel really good right now. It will really be a tough decision. It's so hard to give up what you love doing. Hanging up the boots will not be an easy thing to do.","Hopefully I can become the Babe Ruth of the World Wrestling Federation and be the champion at the same time.","I know what happens every time I get in front of a UK crowd - they just go nuts and they are so nice and excited and crazy and they won't sit down.","Ultimate Warrior had a hell of a gimmick, but wrestling is about so much more than that. You have to be consistent, work main events every night and have matches that people really believe in and want to see.","After watching wrestling for 20 years, I thought I had enough confidence to do it. There were no wrestling schools at the time.","If I have a problem with someone I talk about them. I don't pick on their kids.","I've always felt from everyone I talk to that the fans feel like I'm tangible and they can talk to me and they know me.","I've never been in a Sweat Lodge. I, myself, personally don't even like sitting in a sauna, so I've never been to a spiritual retreat so I don't understand the whole process.","A lot of people didn't realize that with the carpet being pulled out from under me in such a short time frame I got to such a bad place.","Be a father first. Don't put a priority of being a friend with your wife first, or a friend with your kids first.","I quit doing the movies because the wrestling was going so good and was so on fire during the '80s and '90s, but I was getting all these movie scripts.","I'm the man that made wrestling famous.","The leg drop was a move that nobody really used, and nobody ever hit the ropes and jumped up really high, so I tried it out in Japan and the people loved it. That's how I came up with it.","I hate to toot my own horn but I just feel that I know people and I know fans and I don't feel there is that Angelina Jolie/Brad Pitt barrier with me. I've always felt from everyone I talk to that the fans feel like I'm tangible and they can talk to me and they know me.","I love to give the fans what they want. They're what I miss most when I'm not wrestling. That time in the ring is like being in heaven for me.","And you know what - and I don't mean this in tongue in cheek way - but it's like deja vu. When I walked in to WCW they were producing wrestling on a little teeny sound stage at Disney, okay? I'm walking into TNA and they're producing wrestling in a little teeny sound stage at Universal.","You know a lot of times wrestlers get too full of themselves. They can't separate themselves from the characters. They get used to the excitement, the energy, the lifestyle and the money and with a lot of these guys, when it stops, they self-destruct.","I've been talking to certain wrestlers on the phone lately, and certain female wrestlers that were huge stars ten years ago, and the first thing I ask them is 'do you still want to work?' Do they want to talk, or do they want to wrestle or do something else in the business?","Then as I was wrestling as Terry Boulder. I was on a talk show with Lou Ferrigno, and I was actually bigger than he was! I went back to the dressing room that night and all of the wrestlers go 'Oh my God you're bigger than the hulk on TV' so they started calling me Terry 'The Hulk' Boulder.","I'm 58 years old and I just went through 8 back surgeries. They started cutting on me in February 2009, and I was basically bed ridden for almost two years. I got a real dose of reality that if you don't have your health, you don't have anything."],"Huma Abedin":["I grew up in a very traditional family, but there was never anything I didn't think I could do.","I prefer to be a private person.","There's no detail too small for me.","I remember going with my parents to weddings where the women would arrive covered in black veils, but underneath, they'd be wearing the most exquisite brightly colored Dolce & Gabbana suits. They were like peacocks showing off their tails."],"Hume Cronyn":["I don't mind playing absolute bastards... I just don't want to play the grouch.","To try and stand outside the marriage, I'd say we have complementary capabilities. I do the hustling and the business. I do more script reading. I handle contracts.","The whole business of marshaling one's energies becomes more and more important as one grows older.","I find it very difficult just to sit. I would love to learn how to do that with contentment.","I fill my life with a lot of 'busyness' in between jobs. Then I work very hard. Some of it is quite unhealthy. It's compulsive. I don't know what to do about it. I'm a little old to change.","I do a lot of planning and plotting. That's my greatest weakness. If I'm not terribly careful, I'll plan to a point where it could come out cut and dried.","I've had a bad time, which we won't dwell on. We were married and we worked together for 52 years, and suddenly with her gone I was a quadriplegic. Slowly I'm crawling back.","I try to read everything that's sent me - play scripts, movie scripts - but I've had to make a rule. If the author hasn't grabbed me by Page 25, the piece goes back with a note of apology.","I'm a taskmaster. I was brought up that way, and I'm sure I imposed that on my kids.","Look, you do the bloody well best you can. You fumble. You make mistakes."],"Humphrey Bogart":["The problem with the world is that everyone is a few drinks behind.","The whole world is about three drinks behind.","I was born when you kissed me. I died when you left me. I lived a few weeks while you loved me.","The only thing you owe the public is a good performance.","A hot dog at the game beats roast beef at the Ritz.","I should never have switched from Scotch to Martinis.","The only point in making money is, you can tell some big shot where to go.","Things are never so bad they can't be made worse.","I can't say I ever loved my mother; I admired her.","All you owe the public is a good performance.","You're not a star until they can spell your name in Karachi.","Acting is experience with something sweet behind it.","Well everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out.","I made more lousy pictures than any actor in history.","I've been around a long time. Maybe the people like me."],"Humphrey Carpenter":["Autobiography is probably the most respectable form of lying.","The nice thing about being a writer is that you can make magic happen without learning tricks.","I can write, He floated up to the ceiling, and a baby rabbit came out of his pocket, grew wings, and flew away. And you will believe that it really happened. That's magic, isn't it?"],"Humphrey Gilbert":["We are as near to heaven by sea as by land.","These people are headstrong and if they feel the curb loosed but one link they will with bit in the teeth in one month run further out of the career of good order than they will be brought back in three months."],"Humphrey Lyttelton":["The secret of it is to read what you've got in front of you. Don't, if you suspect that something has a double meaning, don't pause. Don't put on a leery vocal expression if you know what I mean on radio. Don't sort of do anything other than read it.","I just stroll in right before the recording goes on.","I used to look at these pictures of trumpeters pointing their instrument to the ceiling. Stunning pictures, but if you play the trumpet and point it upwards, all the spit comes back into your mouth!","An uncle gave me a side drum and my mother decided I should have lessons.","For me, it's a bigger challenge, it's much harder to do and much more rewarding to do well, then just to think up stuff of your own, hit or miss, because you've got to see to it that you don't torpedo any of his punch lines.","I did the pilot, and when they came through and said they were going to put it on the air, I had already some dates in the book with my band and so on. So Barry did the first one, he may have done a few more than the first one in the series, and I took it up from then.","I started on the fringes of journalism as a cartoonist on The Daily Mail.","It is a very wide range of people that we get for the show.","Well, I had started a program which is even longer running than this one in 1967 which was a jazz program called The Best of Jazz and that still goes out on Monday nights. That's been going for 33 years or something."],"Humphry Davy":["Life is made up, not of great sacrifices or duties, but of little things, in which smiles and kindness, and small obligations given habitually, are what preserve the heart and secure comfort.","Language is not only the vehicle of thought, it is a great and efficient instrument in thinking.","I have learned more from my mistakes than from my successes.","The most important of my discoveries have been suggested to me by my failures.","The art galleries of Paris contain the finest collection of frames I ever saw.","When two elements combine and form more than one compound, the masses of one element that react with a fixed mass of the other are in the ratio of small whole numbers.","In the present state of our knowledge, it would be useless to attempt to speculate on the remote cause of the electrical energy... its relation to chemical affinity is, however, sufficiently evident. May it not be identical with it, and an essential property of matter?"],"Hun Sen":["The lessons of the past should steer us towards ensuring lasting legacies for generations yet to be born.","We have lost the art of sharing and caring.","Cambodia is not going to be bought by anyone.","Cambodia possesses now the rights to look far into the future and everything for making a future construction is waiting for the Cambodian own efforts.","Let me reassure that the Kingdom of Cambodia a country with independence, neutrality, peace, freedom, democracy and human rights as you all have seen, shall be existing with no end.","We want to see all demonstrations stopped.","Peace, so elusive in the past many decades, now finally prevails all over the country.","Yet, our achievements also mask many continuing failings and seem to expose more future dangers.","Pol Pot will surrender, be captured or commit suicide.","The trial organized with U.N. participation of some kind will be for crimes committed by Khmer Rouge leaders from 1975 to 1979.

I've got a lot of dreams I want to achieve, and I hope someone can cheer me on as I'll cheer them on in their dreams.","I struggled with feeling confident for a long time, but I think it's important to be strong and not compromise for anyone or a relationship - I'm drawn to that.","I'm in my dream world.","I'm very shy and awkward. I think the best thing is to embrace it. It's about accepting who you are and what you want to become and knowing all that you've got to work with, whether it's good or bad. My music was the only place I could be me for the longest time.","I am grateful I got the chance to meet Stevie Wonder! He's like royalty to me and is one of my biggest inspirations.","I'm a nerd. Total geek. I never went to homecoming or prom or anything.","Country music busts the wall between performer and audience. There's a connection because there's a vulnerability, a confessional quality, to so much of the songwriting. Those lyrics take you in.","Every time I take a photo, it goes into SnapSeed. Even if it's just a price tag on something, it still goes into SnapSeed, and I start editing it. I'm not a photographer, so I need all the help I can get when it comes to make a picture look cool.","'Encore' was an experiment. 'Encore' was the second chance at a first impression. 'Encore' was not completely planned.","I've got a lot of dreams I want to achieve, and I hope someone can cheer me on as I'll cheer them on in their dreams.","Unfortunately, I'm more experienced than I care to admit on long-distance relationships. Just because that is my life. I travel because I love to. As a result, I have to sort of make it work when a relationship kind of comes into view.","I truly believe that when you've found the one you're searching for, you become a better version of yourself. You're better for it.","The rule of songwriting: say what you want to say, say it again, say it a different way, then say it again.","I love flying planes.","I just love music gear, I'm a total geek all around.","I grew up in a fun-loving environment - you work hard and play hard.","If I could make noise with anything, I was going to.","All the people I hung out with were musicians.","I was addicted to playing music.","All my band members were old enough to be my dad. It was like this family vibe.","Thank you to country radio for believing in me.","When I was in high school, I had binders with pictures of tour buses.","There is a bit of a movement as far as younger people in country music. That is cool because people are saying things like, 'I didn't listen to country music until so-and-so came along.' And I'm like, 'Yeah! Now you know why I love it.'","Yes, I did lock myself in my room for about two years and write some songs and things like that. But I don't feel like I missed out on a whole lot.","All I knew when I moved to Nashville was that I wanted to make music in whatever shape and form I could.","I wrote my first song at 6. I spent every day with the guitar, and I just made up songs.","I always loved LeAnn Rimes and especially Clint Black for his soulfulness. As I've gotten older, my influences have broadened - John Mayer, Michael Buble, Stevie Wonder, Keith Urban, Stevie Ray Vaughn, the Beatles - all of these artists have somehow been a part of my development as a songwriter.","I hope people half my age and twice my age will listen to my music - I want it to live forever and for my audience to feel like they have a friend in my music. Music is a spirit. It heals. It's an amazing thing to be loved and appreciated, and sometimes, music has not just been my best friend, it's been my only friend.","I want people to say about me, 'I know he's making music because he loves it.'","Robert Duvall saw me playing at a restaurant in Louisiana and invited me to be an extra in his movie 'The Apostle.' He gave me a guitar for my sixth birthday, and I thought that was the coolest thing in the world.","I've always been shy, but I see that as a good thing because it kept me focused on music. When I was in seventh grade, I asked my parents for a mobile recording system for Christmas, and I got it. I didn't come out of my room for years after that. I'd get invited to the movies and I'd say, 'I'm gonna finish a couple of demos.'","My mom makes the best Cajun stuff. I'm a big gumbo guy. I've lost a lot of my Louisiana accent, so now when I say 'gumbo,' I feel like someone who's never said the word before.","Meeting Stevie Wonder was a massive, lifetime achievement for me. He's one of the sweetest people. I sense a kindred spirit in him, and I hope he'd say the same. Actually, he did.","'Wanted' is about a girl I was friends with, but at the time it was teetering on the edge of something more. I wanted to show her that I really cared about her. 'Wanted' was my way of saying, 'we're friends and have a great foundation, and this could be something really special.'","I don't have a girlfriend. I don't know if I have a type, but I really like girls who are driven. I really care about music, so I like it when a girl really cares about something too. Whatever it is they are into, I'll be their biggest fan.","Every demo I do has a mandolin or resonator on it - some element of the bluegrass or classic country world that I grew up listening to and that first drew me in. And then I always try to find somewhere for a bluesy guitar sound, because that's also what I love. Musically, I'm always finding my way home.","The stage is my comfort zone, and playing live is what I've always wanted to do. It's why I want to do two hundred dates a year. I wouldn't feel that way if I were nervous onstage.","Music is by no means something I was like, 'I'm going to make a career out of this!' It's the only thing I know how to do, so it was more like, 'I hope to God I can make a career out of this!'","There's something fun about the road because there's no 9 to 5. But I do find myself making the effort to take some time off. As much as I don't want to, I have to. I need to reset. I love weeks off, because I can go in the studio and just be creative again.","I'm naturally shy, so the social media thing is new to me. I haven't really figured out how my voice sounds on social media, you know? I don't want to tweet everyday just for the sake of tweeting. I want to make sure whatever I do there is honest. Social media can very quickly get fake, and I don't want to be that guy.","I was born with this love for music, and I say 'born with' because I don't really remember a day waking up and deciding that I'm going do to music. It's been all I've ever done and all I've ever wanted to do.","I started writing when I was around 6. I say 'writing,' but it was really just making up stuff! I started writing and doing my own thing. I didn't really know what a demo was or anything like that, so I started getting interested in studio gear and started learning about one instrument at a time. My first instrument was an accordion.","Growing up in Louisiana, my grandmother gave me an accordion because of our Cajun heritage. What ended up happening was I started learning about more instruments, so I just kind of went that route. Music's really all I've ever done.","I'm from Louisiana, and that's where I got my start, in Cajun music. There's a huge music scene down there centered around our culture. Those are people that are not making music for a living. They are making music for the fun of it. And I think that's the best way I could have been introduced to music.","I wrote my first song when I was 6 years old. It was actually called 'Six Years Old.'","When I was 13 or 14, I took seven months off from touring. I did a lot of weekend gigs in Louisiana. We have fairs and festivals every weekend. But I took seven months off. That's when I really started digging deep. I wrote a couple songs that year that I still play every now and then for people.","I write for myself. I don't write because I have a record coming out. I write because I want to. I need to.","My celebrity crush is not gonna find out who my celebrity crush is anytime soon. I'm so nervous! I may keep that to myself because if I do meet her and she already knows about it, that could be awkward.","Anyone who tells you they're not nervous playing on the CMAs stage, I'm afraid they're not telling you the whole story.","As a new artist - I don't care who you talk to - I think everyone would agree, it's hard to get your expectations right.","I don't even have a type, I don't think. My type is just whoever can get along with me.","Albums are chapters. They're part of a story.","I don't believe in making a record and rushing it.","There's a lot of people I'd like to write with, like Keith Urban or even as far out as Stevie Wonder.","My favorite song depends on the day, what I'm going through, what I'm feeling.","Every demo I do has a mandolin or resonator on it - some element of the bluegrass or classic country world that I grew up listening to and that first drew me in. And then I always try to find somewhere for a bluesy guitar sound, because that's also what I love.","I could be myself. I'm very shy and awkward. I think the best thing is to embrace it.","I like driving around town and listening to new records.","When I was in seventh grade, I asked my parents for a mobile recording system for Christmas, and I got it. I didn't come out of my room for years after that. I'd get invited to the movies and I'd say, 'I'm gonna finish a couple of demos.'","In any city or town, you can find a good, rocking Italian place. The most unhealthy thing on the menu? I'll have two of those!","Singing live is my favorite. When people sing along to your songs, the circle is complete.","I am, by nature, a guitar player... I learned all of these other instruments around that, and around the theory that I built learning the guitar.","I used to think there was a scientific way to do things. Like a proper way to answer a question or that kind of stuff. It's like, there's not! There's not a method, there's not a science to it.","To be the name on somebody's shirt that they've made themselves in preparation for one of your shows - it doesn't get much cooler than that.","I have a string of competitiveness in me. It's really strange 'cause it's not something that I would even expect myself to have, but every now and then it kinda sneaks out, you know.","I've got some crazy, stupid big goals. I really wanna headline arenas. I wanna have such a big crew that we've got to have 20 or 30 buses on the road because that's how big the show we're putting on is.","Writing by myself, I spread that out more. I'll spend more time on a song then. I'm more critical about it, because there's no one else in the room to tell me, 'That's really not translating. I'm not getting what you're saying.' So, I'm constantly rewriting it, thinking, 'No, that's fine,' and going back.","I'm not a photographer, so I need all the help I can get when it comes to make a picture look cool.","My dad said 'When you love what you do, you never work a day in your life,' and I agree with that.","Anytime I can go fly for a few hours, I go. It's stressful and stress-relieving at the same time.","My first instrument was an accordion. Growing up in Louisiana, my grandmother gave me an accordion because of our Cajun heritage.","A bass player has to think and play like a bass player. A drummer has to play and think like a drummer, and stay out of the way of the vocalist. The guitar player has to respect everybody else.","I am a huge, huge Ronnie Milsap fan. I have been for a long time.","I love driving. I've been obsessed with driving something since I was a kid.","I love the practicality of a good car. You know what I mean? And when I say 'practicality,' I mean the complete practicality of a Ferrari 458, a wonderfully fantastic every day car."],"Hunter King":["The solution to putting an end to bullying is to stop it at the source but also to find out what is causing the person to behave the way that they do.","One bully changing their behavior for the better can have a profound effect on many, many lives."],"Hunter Parrish":["My first job was a commercial for Ball Park Fun Franks.","The truth is I want to make music that people enjoy.","As soon as things become predictable, they become boring.","New York is a character, all on its own, and whenever you film there, it becomes part of the show. That's just the nature of being there.","I like telling stories.","I keep getting cast as this bad guy, and I don't know why.","I just think Texas and that whole Bible Belt section is so, like, corporate. And I don't agree with organized religion in that respect.","I grew up in Plano, Texas.","People sometimes forget how important Broadway is as a place for young actors to grow.","I'm kind of A.D.D., and so my mind wanders a lot.","Maybe I'm a better actor when I know there's going to be an older woman involved.","I don't even drink coffee.","I cry at the end of every book.","My morals are important to me.","Ultimately, I'm fine with everything that I've done.","I started making music for myself when I was sixteen.","I am such a goody-two-shoes.","I've written probably over 200 songs that have a verse and a chorus and that's it.","My mom grew up in Kansas, my dad in Indiana. They had boring childhoods.","I've never done a blind date but my parents met on a blind date.","I want people around me who call me out and hold me accountable."],"Hunter S. Thompson":["Some may never live, but the crazy never die.","When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.","As long as I'm learning something, I figure I'm OK - it's a decent day.","In a closed society where everybody's guilty, the only crime is getting caught. In a world of thieves, the only final sin is stupidity.","There are many harsh lessons to be learned from the gambling experience, but the harshest one of all is the difference between having Fun and being Smart.","The Edge... there is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over.","Good news is rare these days, and every glittering ounce of it should be cherished and hoarded and worshipped and fondled like a priceless diamond.","I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence, or insanity to anyone, but they've always worked for me.","'Crazy' is a term of art; 'Insane' is a term of law. Remember that, and you will save yourself a lot of trouble.","I learned a long time ago that reality was much weirder than anyone's imagination.","Luck is a very thin wire between survival and disaster, and not many people can keep their balance on it.","If Sunday is the Lord's day, then Saturday belongs to the Devil. It is the only night of the week when he gives out Free passes to the Late show at the Too Much Fun Club.","I am a generous man, by nature, and far more trusting than I should be. Indeed. The real world is risky territory for people with generosity of spirit. Beware.","There is no such thing as paranoia. Your worst fears can come true at any moment.","Marathon running, like golf, is a game for players, not winners. That is why Callaway sells golf clubs and Nike sells running shoes. But running is unique in that the world's best racers are on the same course, at the same time, as amateurs, who have as much chance of winning as your average weekend warrior would scoring a touchdown in the NFL.","A word to the wise is infuriating.","The world is still a weird place, despite my efforts to make clear and perfect sense of it.","The person who doesn't scatter the morning dew will not comb gray hairs.","If you're going to be crazy, you have to get paid for it or else you're going to be locked up.","For every moment of triumph, for every instance of beauty, many souls must be trampled.","I am not a yachting person, by nature, but I have just enough experience on the sea under sail to feel a certain nostalgia for it when I see a big white racing yacht heeled over at cruising speed on the ocean, and I can still tie a mean bowline knot on just about anything in less than 10 seconds.","Freedom is something that dies unless it's used.","I have a theory that the truth is never told during the nine-to-five hours.","I am more than just a serious basketball fan. I am a life-long addict. I was addicted from birth, in fact, because I was born in Kentucky and I learned, early on, that Habitual Domination was a natural way of life.","Rude people will now & then ask me why I think I know so much about Politics. I tell them it's because I'm Smart... But that is a lie: The real reason is because I'm an incurable Gambling addict.","I have long understood that losing always comes with the territory when you wander into the gambling business, just as getting crippled for life is an acceptable risk in the linebacker business. They both are extremely violent sports, and pain is part of the bargain. Buy the ticket, take the ride.","I have warned many times about the guaranteed dangers of betting with your heart instead of your head - big darkness, soon come - but every once in a while you get a fair chance to have it both ways, and the annual NCAA basketball Tournament is one of them.","With the possible exception of things like box scores, race results, and stock market tabulations, there is no such thing as Objective Journalism. The phrase itself is a pompous contradiction in terms.","America... just a nation of two hundred million used car salesmen with all the money we need to buy guns and no qualms about killing anybody else in the world who tries to make us uncomfortable.","Truth is weirder than any fiction I've seen.","The only difference between the sane and the insane is that the sane have the power to lock up the insane.","March is a month without mercy for rabid basketball fans. There is no such thing as a 'gentleman gambler' when the Big Dance rolls around. All sheep will be fleeced, all fools will be punished severely... There are no Rules when the deal goes down in the final weeks of March. Even your good friends will turn into monsters.","Yesterday's weirdness is tomorrow's reason why.","Victory is a fleeting thing in the gambling business. Today's winners are tomorrow's blinking toads, dumb beasts with no hope.","There is no fool like a careless gambler who starts taking victory for granted.","The mind of America is seized by a fatal dry rot - and it's only a question of time before all that the mind controls will run amuck in a frenzy of stupid, impotent fear.","I just usually go with my own taste. If I like something, and it happens to be against the law, well, then I might have a problem.","You can turn your back on a person, but never turn your back on a drug, especially when its waving a razor sharp hunting knife in your eye.","All the blood is drained out of democracy - it dies - when only half the population votes.","February is always a bad month for TV sports. Football is gone, basketball is plodding along in the annual midseason doldrums, and baseball is not even mentioned.","It was the Law of the Sea, they said. Civilization ends at the waterline. Beyond that, we all enter the food chain, and not always right at the top.","Gambling can turn into a dangerous two-way street when you least expect it. Weird things happen suddenly, and your life can go all to pieces.","As far as I'm concerned, it's a damned shame that a field as potentially dynamic and vital as journalism should be overrun with dullards, bums, and hacks, hag-ridden with myopia, apathy, and complacence, and generally stuck in a bog of stagnant mediocrity.","Buy the ticket, take the ride.","There is nothing more helpless and irresponsible than a man in the depths of an ether binge.","I am an Addictive Personality, they say, a natural slave to passion - and many Doctors have warned me against it.

Losing is bad for the image, dude. Nobody buys Hot Tips from Losers. Remember that.","I am a professional sportswriter, among other things, and I take the games seriously. It is only one of my many powerful addictions, and I don't mind admitting any of them.","Nixon was a bad loser. He hated losing worse than death, and that is why I enjoyed him. We were both football fans, both addicts; and on some days, nothing else mattered.","One thing I have learned in my painful career as a gambler is that bragging when you get lucky and win a few games will plunge you into gloom and unacceptable beatings very soon. It happens every time.","Nixon represents that dark, venal and incurably violent side of the American character almost every other country in the world has learned to fear and despise.","Democracy as a system has evolved into something that Thomas Jefferson didn't anticipate.","One of the most basic factors in sports is that winning becomes a habit, and losing is the same way. When failure starts to feel normal in your life or your work or even your darkest vices, you won't have to go looking for trouble, because trouble will find you. Count on it.","The only thing wrong with the NBA - or any other professional sport, for that matter - is a wild epidemic of Dumbness and overweening Greed. There is no Mystery about it, and no need to change any rules.","Yes sir, I am a tortured man for all seasons, as they say, and I have powerful friends in high places. Birds sing where I walk, and children smile when they see me coming.","No man is so foolish but he may sometimes give another good counsel, and no man so wise that he may not easily err if he takes no other counsel than his own. He that is taught only by himself has a fool for a master.","The TV business is uglier than most things. It is normally perceived as some kind of cruel and shallow money trench through the heart of the journalism industry, a long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps run free and good men die like dogs, for no good reason.","The best thing about the Kentucky Derby is that it is only two minutes long. It is the quickest event in sports, except for Sumo-wrestling & Mike Tyson fights. Maybe Drag-racing is quicker, but I have never been attracted to it.","If I'd written all the truth I knew for the past ten years, about 600 people - including me - would be rotting in prison cells from Rio to Seattle today. Absolute truth is a very rare and dangerous commodity in the context of professional journalism.","Politics is the art of controlling your environment.","By disgracing and degrading the presidency of the United States, by fleeing the White House like a diseased cur, Richard Nixon broke the heart of the American Dream.","I hate pain, despite my ability to tolerate it beyond all known parameters, which is not necessarily a good thing.","Objective journalism is one of the main reasons that American politics has been allowed to be so corrupt for so long.","Richard Nixon was a criminally insane Monster - Bill Clinton is a black-hearted Swine of a friend.","You better take care of me Lord, if you don't you're gonna have me on your hands.","The behavior of the crowd at Churchill Downs is like 100,000 vicious Hyenas going berserk all at once in a space about the size of a 777 jet or the White House lawn.","Fiction is based on reality unless you're a fairytale artist.","I think I'm one of the most patriotic people that I've ever encountered in America. I consider myself a bedrock patriot. I participate very actively in local politics, because my voice might be worthwhile. I participate in a meaningful way - not by donations; I work at it.","There is always room for losers in the football business. They are the mother's milk of gambling, and why not? Somebody has to do it, or there won't be any winners.","I have always loved blizzards, if only because of the driving experience - which is definitely an acquired taste.","Without gambling, I would not exist.","Rush Limbaugh is a lame professional swine, and he makes a good living at it. He is like a hired geek in some traveling backwoods carnival - the freaks who bite the heads off chickens - but Limbaugh is a modernized geek who thinks he can bite the heads off of people.","Going to trial with a lawyer who considers your whole life-style a Crime in Progress is not a happy prospect.","I am surprised and embarrassed to be a part of the first American generation to leave the country in far worse shape than it was when we first came into it.","I have always hated bowling, and I don't mind admitting it.","The writer must be a participant in the scene... like a film director who writes his own scripts, does his own camera work, and somehow manages to film himself in action, as the protagonist or at least the main character.","Paranoia is just another word for ignorance.","The Raiders of old were vicious and crazy and cruel. Hanging around their locker room was like hanging around the weight room at Folsom Prison.","The Hell's Angels try not to do anything halfway, and anyone who deals in extremes is bound to cause trouble, whether he means to or not. This, along with a belief in total retaliation for any offense or insult, is what makes the Hell's Angels unmanageable for the police and morbidly fascinating to the general public.","That was always the difference between Muhammad Ali and the rest of us. He came, he saw, and if he didn't entirely conquer - he came as close as anybody we are likely to see in the lifetime of this doomed generation.","Richard Nixon was an evil man - evil in a way that only those who believe in the physical reality of the Devil can understand it. He was utterly without ethics or morals or any bedrock sense of decency.","Remember this, folks - I am a Hillbilly, and I don't always Bet the same way I talk. Good advice is one thing, but smart gambling is quite another.","I don't think that my kind of journalism has ever been universally popular. It's lonely out here.","By any accepted standard, I have had more than nine lives. I counted them up once, and there were 13 times I almost and maybe should have died.","I had a soft-spot in my heart for Ronald Reagan, if only because he was a sportswriter in his youth.","Justice is expensive in America. There are no Free Passes... You might want to remember this, the next time you get careless and blow off a few Parking Tickets. They will come back to haunt you the next time you see a Cop car in your rear-view mirror.","The next MVP of the Super Bowl is just as likely to have been a full-time grocery store bagger last year as a Heisman Trophy winner.","I guess that's one of the things about growing up in the fifties - it never occurred to me that you wouldn't be at least as successful as your parents.","The trouble with Nixon is that he's a serious politics junkie. He's totally hooked and like any other junkie, he's a bummer to have around, especially as President.","Quacks are a part of our culture, and we all fall prey to them. Who among us can say, for sure, that even our own personal physicians are honest and competent?","In my heart, I am always a Raider.","Of all the men that have run for president in the twentieth century, only George McGovern truly understood what a monument America could be to the human race.","I can't think in terms of journalism without thinking in terms of political ends. Unless there's been a reaction, there's been no journalism. It's cause and effect.","I wasn't trying to be an outlaw writer. I never heard of that term; somebody else made it up. But we were all outside the law: Kerouac, Miller, Burroughs, Ginsberg, Kesey; I didn't have a gauge as to who was the worst outlaw. I just recognized allies: my people.","Nixon was no more a saint than he was a great president.","There might be some serious fun in politics.","I was 22 when JFK was murdered, and I will never recover from it... Never.","I've already become a mastodon in print - I don't see a consciousness for my kind of journalism.","Not everybody is comfortable with the idea that politics is a guilty addiction. But it is.","Duke is an ugly word in Kentucky. Nothing in the world compares to the joy of beating those hateful swine from Duke."],"Hunter Tylo":["So, not only am I panicking over the weekend if I need to know my lines, but also if can I get the kids to the zoo. Can I even go to church? I was asking for certain things that would allow me to plan my life a little better.","We were led to a pediatric ophthalmologist. It's a hard date for me, April 14, 1998. The doctor came back from the examining room and told us she had tumors in both eyes.","We share responsibility. It's important to have a good spouse; that's where I sympathize with single parents.","We cannot really communicate with our fans.","Unfortunately, since the Sept. 11 tragedy, our business is not doing too well.","There was a storyline this year where Taylor lied to Brooke. It was supposed to be set up in a way that I was so outraged by her that I let it stay. I thought that was human, which was great.","There is really a whole new appreciation when you leave and then come back.","The only problem with the way they do my character is that they have her get redeemed too early.","The main concern was making sure the kids didn't get caught in the middle.","The house seemed so empty without him. And I thought about the life we'd been building together for all that time. I realized I was on the brink of losing it all. It just scared me into reality.","One girl was helped from my appearance on the show, and I swore I would not keep quiet again. When you talk about things that are embarrassing or devastating, obviously you can help people when you do.","My children are the focal point of my life. I was asking for a little more time to spend with them.","It was scary, and I knew what it was like to be an unemployed actress again.","In September, I left the show. We were going through discussions and negotiations, and I had been on the show for about 11 years, and there were some things that I was asking for that I didn't feel were the moon or the stars.","If I was a bad character that got away with murder like we see on other shows, I do not think I would like it because that sends a message that you can do these horrible things and never pay for it.","I was moaning and grieving as if I lost one of my own children. It was probably one of the most real feelings I ever had on the show. I was just sitting there wailing with no lines. I was beat after that storyline.","I told him that I can play it if he wanted to write it, and I would be willing to try and go there emotionally. I did not know as an actress if I would be able to get there, because when you feel really deep emotions or pain, you don't want to go back there.","I really like to communicate to my fans. I have a fan club president who I've had for over 15 years.","I kind of thought the writers were starting to take Taylor and make her kind of down and dirty.","I have a really great relationship with God. I pray. I read the Bible.","I had just won the lawsuit against Melrose Place.","CBS started to confiscate our packages and mail as a safety procedure. A lot of packages that people send for the holidays and to our kids we can't open. A lot of times they are from overseas. It's very upsetting at times."],"Husnu Ozyegin":["There are companies with management and companies with money. You can always find money. Management is the key to success in any business.","The easiest way to get into northern Iraq is through Turkey.","European and American banks are conservative in the sense that they don't come at their full strength to markets where we are; that leaves us an opportunity to be successful.","There are many businesses that are born and die. A university is supposed to live forever.","Start small; get to know the landscape. We take risks but not major risks. We always started with small capital - €4m in Holland, $10m in Russia - and as we get to know the landscape of a country, we think about other businesses.","I was not only a billionaire but the richest man in Turkey. It's a great feeling, but your responsibilities increase.","Getting to the top is not so easy; staying there is more difficult.","The most important problem that Turkey has is education.","I'm giving away 2 percent of my net income every month. I don't think Bill Gates is doing that.","It's important to do see the results of your philanthropy while you are alive.","I want to be remembered as the biggest philanthropist in Turkey.","I tell foreign companies that come here... 'Don't see Turkey as a country of 770,000 sq km and $800bn gross domestic product. This country has the potential to do so much business in the surrounding countries.'","As Turkish entrepreneurs perform well in Iraq, the Iraqis will have more confidence in Turkish contractors than in some European company they do not know."],"Hussein Chalayan":["If I had to define my philosophy, it would be about exploration, a journey, a story-telling.","Being a part of exhibitions is not a burden; it's another way for an independent label such as mine to reach a larger audience by exposing them to my whole body of work.","I was lucky I went to school in London because the tutors could see what to do. I knew I wanted to do something different. Why would I want to do what other people were already doing, because they would always do it better? I always wanted to work around the body. So throughout my college years, my work was quite free.","I was drawn to biology and history and, of course, art. And I loved languages. The biggest problem I had is that I wasn't taught about the connections between all these things. I think that would have given life a lot more meaning and it would be a lot more enjoyable.","I am an idealist, which can be tiring.","I wanted to be a pilot, but I was always drawing bodies. When I realised I wanted to pursue something creative, my parents pushed me towards architecture.","I can be working on a collection and a film at the same time. It can take a lot out of me, but the processes come from the same source. From a brief I set myself I can make a film, I can make a collection, I can make an installation.","London gives birth to amazing talent but is rubbish at helping maintain it.","I think of fashion as an art form as well as an industrial product - and something that has to be sold well and has to be of high quality."],"Hussein of Jordan":["I wish to say to you that the life of an enlightened people and a vibrant nation cannot be measured by the life of an individual. A successful person is one who manages to lay down a new stone, a brick that would help firm up his nation's existence.","We should face reality and our past mistakes in an honest, adult way. Boasting of glory does not make glory, and singing in the dark does not dispel fear.","Jordan has a strange, haunting beauty and a sense of timelessness. Dotted with the ruins of empires once great, it is the last resort of yesterday in the world of tomorrow. I love every inch of it.","It is my firm belief that I have a link with the past and a responsibility to the future. I cannot give up. I cannot despair. There's a whole future, generations to come. I have to keep trying.","Personality is reduced and deformed with depleted thoughts and stagnant mind.","God help us from those who believe that they are the sole possessors of truth. How we manage at times to agree willingly to become prisoners within our own minds and souls of beliefs and ideas on which we can never be flexible.","I will never work merely to make a reputation for myself, to be popular for appearances rather than for what I am. My task is to lead my country through service.","Fundamentalism as it is called is not confined to the Muslim world. It is something that we have seen in different parts of the world. Let us hope that a dialogue between the followers of the three great monotheistic religions could help in putting an end to this.","Real victories are those that protect human life, not those that result from its destruction or emerge from its ashes.","I am ever mindful of the legacy of my grandfather, the founder of this Kingdom, who had said to me that he perceived his life as a link in a continuous chain of those who served our nation and that he expected me to be a new and strong link in the same chain.","We believe democracy to be the only real guarantor of stability and we have sought to create a 'Jordanian model' that might also inspire others in our region. I wish democracy and peace to be my legacy to my people and the shield of generations to come.","I have said this in the past and I will continue to repeat it as long as I live: Whoever tries to hurt our national unity is my enemy until the day of judgement.","All what we hope for is that a day will come, when we have all gone, when people will say that this man has tried, and his family tried. This is all there is to seek in this world.","We respect opposition to any position or policy. But we believe that the opinion that should prevail and be respected is that of the majority.","Jordan seeks to play only one role, that of a model state. It is our aim to set an example for our Arab brethren, not one that they need follow but one that will inspire them to seek a higher, happier destiny within their own borders.","Without peace and without the overwhelming majority of people that believe in peace defending it, working for it, believing in it, security can never really be a reality.","After all, I think Jerusalem is part of the, of the world's heritage.","Sometimes, leaders' failures can cost these young people's lives.","At seventeen, I knew the end of a dream... I would never be a schoolboy again.","We belong to the camp of peace. We believe in peace. We believe that our one God wishes us to live in peace and wishes peace upon us, for these are His teachings to all the followers of the three great monotheistic religions, the Children of Abraham.","I, not for the first time, would like to say that I never took a pro-Iraq position during the Gulf War.","In this life struggle, here I am among you fully cognizant that a true believer has no fear of what God has ordained for him. Those who are visited by fear live only for their present, under the illusion that the world began with them and will end with their departure.","I am totally against the idea that a Muslim woman should not have the same opportunities as a Muslim man to learn, to open up, to work, help shape the future. To close Islam down to a sexist approach is totally intolerable and ridiculous. It's not Islam.","Under the auspices of peace, our comprehensive renaissance will be built, and it will be a model for those who wish to emulate it in the greater Arab homeland.","For our part, we shall continue to work for the new dawn when all the Children of Abraham and their descendants are living together in the birthplace of their three great monotheistic religions, a life free from fear, a life free from want - a life in peace.","I want to say a simple thing, that the dividing line exists not between Jordan and Israel, but between the proponents of peace and the opponents of peace.","It is not enough to tackle the mechanics of terror organizations. We must also tackle the situations that create terrorists. We desperately need to address the frustration, the loss and the despair that drive some to these actions.","The link between peace and stability on the one hand, and social and economic growth on the other, is dialectic. Peace, poverty, and backwardness cannot mix in one region.","The absence and suppression of justice can only open the way for extremists to exploit such a condition to perpetrate acts of violence against innocents.","We oppose occupation of land by force and we believe in dialogue as the method for regaining Arab rights. This is the spirit of the Great Arab Revolt.","We believe that peace is not just signed papers, but rather a contract between generations for the building of a more promising and less threatening future.","Nothing is more useless in developing a nation's economy than a gun, and nothing blocks the road to social development more than the financial burden of war. War is the arch enemy of national progress and the modern scourge of civilized men.","God willing, we shall come to a stage where the world looks at the Palestinian question, and Palestinian rights on Palestinian national soil, as well as the questions of the occupied Syrian and Lebanese territories. These are the bases on which peace will be built.","It would behoove the world to become used to this fact: that without a just solution to the Palestine tragedy, there can be no stable peace in the Middle East.","Let me say this loud and clear. There is a world of difference between terrorist acts and the Islamic Shari'a. Islam is not only a religion, but a way of life. And at its heart lie the sacred principles of tolerance and dialogue.","Our religion does not discriminate according to color, sex or anything else. What counts is piety and faith.","Jordan has a very important part in any Arab-Israeli peace process.","I am pro-peace.","I'm proud of what I've done in Jordan, but the region itself is sitting on a time bomb."],"Huston Smith":["Swallow your pride and admit that we all need help at times.","The most powerful moral influence is example.","In nature, the emphasis is in what is rather than what ought to be.","When the scientific method came into being, it gave us a new window on the truth; namely, a method by laboratory-controlled experiments to winnow true hypotheses from false ones.","First of all, my persuasion is what really breeds violence is political differences. But because religion serves as the soul of community, it gets drawn into the fracas and turns up the heat.","God has to speak to each person in their own language, in their own idioms. Take Spanish, Chinese. You can express the same thought, but to different people you have to use a different language. It's the same in religion.","Walnuts have a shell, and they have a kernel. Religions are the same. They have an essence, but then they have a protective coating. This is not the only way to put it. But it's my way. So the kernels are the same. However, the shells are different.","Human intelligence is a reflection of the intelligence that produces everything. In knowing, we are simply extending the intelligence that comes to and constitutes us. We mimic the mind of God, so to speak. Or better, we continue and extend it.","I've spent the last 50 years or so steeping myself in the world's religions, and I've done my homework. I've gone to each of the world's eight great religions and sought out the most profound scholars I could find, and I've apprenticed myself to them and actually practiced each faith.","Exclusively oral cultures are unencumbered by dead knowledge, dead facts. Libraries, on the other hand, are full of them.","There are wonderfully intrinsic moments when life makes sense, and doubts are banished as irrelevant in those moments. Of course, we can't stay in that state. We're not here to be blissed out all the time.","The crisis that the world finds itself in as it swings on the hinge of a new millennium is located in something deeper than particular ways of organizing political systems and economies.","Whether things turn out for the better depends on what we do. We ought not spend our time masterminding the future, but recognize our marching orders: to do the best we can for history and the planet.","At the center of the religious life is a peculiar kind of joy, the prospect of a happy ending that blossoms from necessarily painful ordeals, the promise of human difficulties embraced and overcome.","The scientific method is nearly perfect for understanding the physical aspects of our life. But it is a radically limited viewfinder in its inability to offer values, morals and meanings that are at the center of our lives.","I had assumed that Bush's seemingly inflexible policy to support Sharon was for political reasons of his getting elected. But as to whether he really believes his actions are going to hasten the day of the final conflict, I do not know.","Rationalism and Newtonian science has lured us into dark woods, but a new metaphysics can rescue us.","It's often difficult for us to act compassionately, but sacred art eases the difficulty by ennobling us.","Poetry is a special use of language that opens onto the real. The business of the poet is truth telling, which is why in the Celtic tradition no one could be a teacher unless he or she was a poet.","The modern period adds social ethics to religions agenda, for we now realize that social structures are not like laws of nature. They are human creations, so we are responsible for them.","So always, if we look back, concern for face-to-face morality, and its modern emphasis on justice as well, have historically evolved as religious issues.","In order to live man must believe in that for which he lives.","Every society and religion has rules, for both have moral laws. And the essence of morality consists, as in art, of drawing the line somewhere.","The faith I was born into formed me.","When I read the Upanishads, which are part of Vedanta, I found a profundity of worldview that made my Christianity seem like third grade.","The New Age movement looks like a mixed bag. I see much in it that seems good: It's optimistic; it's enthusiastic; it has the capacity for belief. On the debit side, I think one needs to distinguish between belief and credulity.","Religion is the call to confront reality; to master the self.","God is defined by Jesus but not confined to Jesus.","It is commonly said and known that each civilization has its own religion. Now my claim is that if we look deeper, the different civilizations were brought into being by the different revelations.","I think it matters almost infinitely that we practice one of the authentic religions. But if you mean does it make any difference which. The answer is no, as long as each is followed with equal intensity, sincerity, dedication.","I grew up taking it for granted that missionaries were what American boys grew up to be.","I am very orthodox in thinking that Jesus acted in his life the way God would have acted if God had assumed human form.","I'm not a chauvinist. I'm a universalist. I think that God imploded, like a spiritual big bang, to launch the eight civilizations that make up recorded history and the religions in those civilizations.","I am critical of modernity giving science and technology a blank check as if it were the fountain of all truth. That is not true. And I think I may have introduced a word which has now caught on quite a bit, scientism. Science is good. It simply reports a discovery.","The faith I was born into formed me. I come from a missionary family - I grew up in China - and in my case, my religious upbringing was positive. Of course, not everyone has this experience. I know many of my students are what I have come to think of as wounded Christians or wounded Jews.","The notion that Western religions are more rigid than those of Asia is overdrawn. Ours is the most permissive society history has ever known - almost the only thing that is forbidden now is to forbid - and Asian teachers and their progeny play up to this propensity by soft-pedaling Hinduism's, Buddhism's, Sufism's rules.","I don't have any fear of death. I do, however, have an inordinate fear of becoming dependent on other people. To me, that's the severest test, not death.","You subtract Christianity from Huston Smith, and there is no Huston Smith left.","Pure science - this vision of the universe as 15 billion light years across - I am bedazzled and awed by it.","Science is like a flashlight in the hands of people living in a huge balloon. They can illuminate anything in the balloon, but cannot shine it outside the balloon to see where it is floating - or if it is floating at all.","The Buddha is in me, the Buddha is in you. Live up to it.","In my town, I had only one adult American male role model: my father. I grew up taking it for granted that missionaries were what American boys grew up to be.","I happen to be a Christian. I was brought up and drenched in that. I am very orthodox in thinking that Jesus acted in his life the way God would have acted if God had assumed human form.","Science is empirical, all about physical senses that tell us about the world. But physical senses are not the only senses we have. Nobody has ever seen a thought. Nobody has ever seen a feeling. And yet thoughts and feelings are where we live our lives most immediately, and science cannot connect with that.","No one in human history has given as much thought to the interweaving of altered states of consciousness and religion as I have.","The Chinese began with the assumption that the group is the fundamental unit of reality. Individuals? Sure, we can factor them out from their groups, but let us not think that they as individuals have any viability apart from their group."],"Hutton Gibson":["Anyway, there were more after the war than before.","Hitler had this deal where he was supposed to make it rough on them so they would all get out and migrate to Israel because they needed people there to fight the Arabs.","They're after one world religion and one world government. That's why they've attacked the Catholic Church so strongly, to ultimately take control over it by their doctrine.","Greenspan tells us what to do. Someone should take him out and hang him."],"Hyman Rickover":["If you are going to sin, sin against God, not the bureaucracy. God will forgive you but the bureaucracy won't.","Good ideas are not adopted automatically. They must be driven into practice with courageous patience.","If you're going to sin, sin against God, not the bureaucracy; God will forgive you but the bureaucracy won't."],"Hypatia":["Life is an unfoldment, and the further we travel the more truth we can comprehend. To understand the things that are at our door is the best preparation for understanding those that lie beyond.","Reserve your right to think, for even to think wrongly is better than not to think at all.","Fables should be taught as fables, myths as myths, and miracles as poetic fantasies. To teach superstitions as truths is a most terrible thing. The child mind accepts and believes them, and only through great pain and perhaps tragedy can he be in after years relieved of them.","All formal dogmatic religions are fallacious and must never be accepted by self-respecting persons as final.","In fact men will fight for a superstition quite as quickly as for a living truth - often more so, since a superstition is so intangible you cannot get at it to refute it, but truth is a point of view, and so is changeable."]}
